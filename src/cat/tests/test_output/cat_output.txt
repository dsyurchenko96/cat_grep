   833	CHAPTER I
   834	
   835	âWell, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
   836	Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you donât tell me that this means war,
   837	if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
   838	AntichristâI really believe he is AntichristâI will have nothing
   839	more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my
   840	âfaithful slave,â as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I
   841	have frightened youâsit down and tell me all the news.â
   842	
   843	It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna PÃ¡vlovna
   844	SchÃ©rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna.
   845	With these words she greeted Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡gin, a man of high
   846	rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna
   847	PÃ¡vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering
   848	from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used
   849	only by the elite.
   850	
   851	All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered
   852	by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:
   853	
   854	âIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the
   855	prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,
   856	I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10âAnnette
   857	SchÃ©rer.â
   858	
   859	âHeavens! what a virulent attack!â replied the prince, not in the
   860	least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an
   861	embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on
   862	his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that
   863	refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and
   864	with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance
   865	who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna PÃ¡vlovna,
   866	kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,
   867	and complacently seated himself on the sofa.
   868	
   869	âFirst of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friendâs
   870	mind at rest,â said he without altering his tone, beneath the
   871	politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony
   872	could be discerned.
   873	
   874	âCan one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times
   875	like these if one has any feeling?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna. âYou are
   876	staying the whole evening, I hope?â
   877	
   878	âAnd the fete at the English ambassadorâs? Today is Wednesday. I
   879	must put in an appearance there,â said the prince. âMy daughter is
   880	coming for me to take me there.â
   881	
   882	âI thought todayâs fete had been canceled. I confess all these
   883	festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.â
   884	
   885	âIf they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have
   886	been put off,â said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force
   887	of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.
   888	
   889	âDonât tease! Well, and what has been decided about NovosÃ­ltsevâs
   890	dispatch? You know everything.â
   891	
   892	âWhat can one say about it?â replied the prince in a cold, listless
   893	tone. âWhat has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has
   894	burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.â
   895	
   896	Prince VasÃ­li always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale
   897	part. Anna PÃ¡vlovna SchÃ©rer on the contrary, despite her forty years,
   898	overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had
   899	become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not
   900	feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
   901	expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it
   902	did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,
   903	as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,
   904	which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to
   905	correct.
   906	
   907	In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna PÃ¡vlovna burst
   908	out:
   909	
   910	âOh, donât speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I donât understand
   911	things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She
   912	is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign
   913	recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one
   914	thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
   915	the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will
   916	not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
   917	revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
   918	this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just
   919	one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial
   920	spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexanderâs
   921	loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to
   922	find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer
   923	did NovosÃ­ltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot
   924	understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for
   925	himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they
   926	promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not
   927	perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and
   928	that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I donât believe a
   929	word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian
   930	neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty
   931	destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!â
   932	
   933	She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
   934	
   935	âI think,â said the prince with a smile, âthat if you had been
   936	sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King
   937	of Prussiaâs consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me
   938	a cup of tea?â
   939	
   940	âIn a moment. Ã propos,â she added, becoming calm again, âI am
   941	expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who
   942	is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best
   943	French families. He is one of the genuine Ã©migrÃ©s, the good ones. And
   944	also the AbbÃ© Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been
   945	received by the Emperor. Had you heard?â
   946	
   947	âI shall be delighted to meet them,â said the prince. âBut
   948	tell me,â he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just
   949	occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief
   950	motive of his visit, âis it true that the Dowager Empress wants
   951	Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all
   952	accounts is a poor creature.â
   953	
   954	Prince VasÃ­li wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were
   955	trying through the Dowager Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna to secure it for
   956	the baron.
   957	
   958	Anna PÃ¡vlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
   959	anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was
   960	pleased with.
   961	
   962	âBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her
   963	sister,â was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
   964	
   965	As she named the Empress, Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs face suddenly assumed an
   966	expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
   967	sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
   968	patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke
   969	beaucoup dâestime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.
   970	
   971	The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and
   972	courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna PÃ¡vlovna
   973	wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man
   974	recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she
   975	said:
   976	
   977	âNow about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came
   978	out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly
   979	beautiful.â
   980	
   981	The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
   982	
   983	âI often think,â she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer
   984	to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
   985	and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
   986	conversationââI often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life
   987	are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?
   988	I donât speak of Anatole, your youngest. I donât like him,â she
   989	added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.
   990	âTwo such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than
   991	anyone, and so you donât deserve to have them.â
   992	
   993	And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
   994	
   995	âI canât help it,â said the prince. âLavater would have said I
   996	lack the bump of paternity.â
   997	
   998	âDonât joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know
   999	I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselvesâ (and her
  1000	face assumed its melancholy expression), âhe was mentioned at Her
  1001	Majestyâs and you were pitied....â
  1002	
  1003	The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
  1004	awaiting a reply. He frowned.
  1005	
  1006	âWhat would you have me do?â he said at last. âYou know I did all
  1007	a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.
  1008	Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That
  1009	is the only difference between them.â He said this smiling in a way
  1010	more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round
  1011	his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and
  1012	unpleasant.
  1013	
  1014	âAnd why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a
  1015	father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,â said Anna
  1016	PÃ¡vlovna, looking up pensively.
  1017	
  1018	âI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my
  1019	children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That
  1020	is how I explain it to myself. It canât be helped!â
  1021	
  1022	He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
  1023	gesture. Anna PÃ¡vlovna meditated.
  1024	
  1025	âHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?â she
  1026	asked. âThey say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I
  1027	donât feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who
  1028	is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess
  1029	Mary BolkÃ³nskaya.â
  1030	
  1031	Prince VasÃ­li did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and
  1032	perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of
  1033	the head that he was considering this information.
  1034	
  1035	âDo you know,â he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad
  1036	current of his thoughts, âthat Anatole is costing me forty thousand
  1037	rubles a year? And,â he went on after a pause, âwhat will it be in
  1038	five years, if he goes on like this?â Presently he added: âThatâs
  1039	what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours
  1040	rich?â
  1041	
  1042	âHer father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is
  1043	the well-known Prince BolkÃ³nski who had to retire from the army under
  1044	the late Emperor, and was nicknamed âthe King of Prussia.â He is
  1045	very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.
  1046	She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.
  1047	He is an aide-de-camp of KutÃºzovâs and will be here tonight.â
  1048	
  1049	âListen, dear Annette,â said the prince, suddenly taking Anna
  1050	PÃ¡vlovnaâs hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. âArrange
  1051	that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe
  1052	with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich
  1053	and of good family and thatâs all I want.â
  1054	
  1055	And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the
  1056	maid of honorâs hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro
  1057	as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.
  1058	
  1059	âAttendez,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, reflecting, âIâll speak to
  1060	Lise, young BolkÃ³nskiâs wife, this very evening, and perhaps the
  1061	thing can be arranged. It shall be on your familyâs behalf that Iâll
  1062	start my apprenticeship as old maid.â
  1063	
  1064	
  1065	
  1066	
  1067	
  1068	CHAPTER II
  1069	
  1070	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs drawing room was gradually filling. The highest
  1071	Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age
  1072	and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.
  1073	Prince VasÃ­liâs daughter, the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne, came to take her
  1074	father to the ambassadorâs entertainment; she wore a ball dress and
  1075	her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess BolkÃ³nskaya,
  1076	known as la femme la plus sÃ©duisante de PÃ©tersbourg, * was also there.
  1077	She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did
  1078	not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince
  1079	VasÃ­liâs son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.
  1080	The AbbÃ© Morio and many others had also come.
  1081	
  1082	     * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.
  1083	
  1084	To each new arrival Anna PÃ¡vlovna said, âYou have not yet seen my
  1085	aunt,â or âYou do not know my aunt?â and very gravely conducted
  1086	him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her
  1087	cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests
  1088	began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her
  1089	aunt, Anna PÃ¡vlovna mentioned each oneâs name and then left them.
  1090	
  1091	Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
  1092	one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them
  1093	cared about; Anna PÃ¡vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
  1094	solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in
  1095	the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her
  1096	Majesty, âwho, thank God, was better today.â And each visitor,
  1097	though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman
  1098	with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not
  1099	return to her the whole evening.
  1100	
  1101	The young Princess BolkÃ³nskaya had brought some work in a
  1102	gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a
  1103	delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,
  1104	but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she
  1105	occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case
  1106	with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defectâthe shortness of her
  1107	upper lip and her half-open mouthâseemed to be her own special and
  1108	peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
  1109	young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and
  1110	carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones
  1111	who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a
  1112	little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life
  1113	and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile
  1114	and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a
  1115	specially amiable mood that day.
  1116	
  1117	The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying
  1118	steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat
  1119	down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a
  1120	pleasure to herself and to all around her. âI have brought my work,â
  1121	said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.
  1122	âMind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,â
  1123	she added, turning to her hostess. âYou wrote that it was to be quite
  1124	a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.â And she
  1125	spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray
  1126	dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.
  1127	
  1128	âSoyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone
  1129	else,â replied Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1130	
  1131	âYou know,â said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
  1132	French, turning to a general, âmy husband is deserting me? He is going
  1133	to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?â she
  1134	added, addressing Prince VasÃ­li, and without waiting for an answer she
  1135	turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
  1136	
  1137	âWhat a delightful woman this little princess is!â said Prince
  1138	VasÃ­li to Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1139	
  1140	One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with
  1141	close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable
  1142	at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout
  1143	young man was an illegitimate son of Count BezÃºkhov, a well-known
  1144	grandee of Catherineâs time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man
  1145	had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only
  1146	just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his
  1147	first appearance in society. Anna PÃ¡vlovna greeted him with the nod she
  1148	accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of
  1149	this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight
  1150	of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face
  1151	when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than
  1152	the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to
  1153	the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which
  1154	distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.
  1155	
  1156	âIt is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor
  1157	invalid,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her
  1158	aunt as she conducted him to her.
  1159	
  1160	Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as
  1161	if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
  1162	princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.
  1163	
  1164	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the
  1165	aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majestyâs health.
  1166	Anna PÃ¡vlovna in dismay detained him with the words: âDo you know the
  1167	AbbÃ© Morio? He is a most interesting man.â
  1168	
  1169	âYes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very
  1170	interesting but hardly feasible.â
  1171	
  1172	âYou think so?â rejoined Anna PÃ¡vlovna in order to say something
  1173	and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now
  1174	committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before
  1175	she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to
  1176	another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet
  1177	spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbÃ©âs
  1178	plan chimerical.
  1179	
  1180	âWe will talk of it later,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna with a smile.
  1181	
  1182	And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she
  1183	resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready
  1184	to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As
  1185	the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes
  1186	round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
  1187	creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the
  1188	machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna PÃ¡vlovna moved about her
  1189	drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a
  1190	word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,
  1191	proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about
  1192	Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
  1193	the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and
  1194	again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbÃ©.
  1195	
  1196	Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna
  1197	PÃ¡vlovnaâs was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all
  1198	the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a
  1199	child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing
  1200	any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident
  1201	and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always
  1202	expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio.
  1203	Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an
  1204	opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.
  1205	
  1206	
  1207	
  1208	
  1209	
  1210	CHAPTER III
  1211	
  1212	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed
  1213	steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,
  1214	beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face
  1215	was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had
  1216	settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round
  1217	the abbÃ©. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful
  1218	Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, Prince VasÃ­liâs daughter, and the little Princess
  1219	BolkÃ³nskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.
  1220	The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1221	
  1222	The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished
  1223	manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
  1224	politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
  1225	which he found himself. Anna PÃ¡vlovna was obviously serving him up as
  1226	a treat to her guests. As a clever maÃ®tre dâhÃ´tel serves up as a
  1227	specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in
  1228	the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna PÃ¡vlovna served up to
  1229	her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbÃ©, as peculiarly choice
  1230	morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the
  1231	murder of the Duc dâEnghien. The vicomte said that the Duc dâEnghien
  1232	had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular
  1233	reasons for Buonaparteâs hatred of him.
  1234	
  1235	âAh, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna,
  1236	with a pleasant feeling that there was something Ã  la Louis XV in the
  1237	sound of that sentence: âContez nous Ã§ela, Vicomte.â
  1238	
  1239	The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
  1240	comply. Anna PÃ¡vlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to
  1241	listen to his tale.
  1242	
  1243	âThe vicomte knew the duc personally,â whispered Anna PÃ¡vlovna to
  1244	one of the guests. âThe vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,â said she
  1245	to another. âHow evidently he belongs to the best society,â said she
  1246	to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest
  1247	and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef
  1248	on a hot dish.
  1249	
  1250	The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.
  1251	
  1252	âCome over here, HÃ©lÃ¨ne, dear,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna to the
  1253	beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of
  1254	another group.
  1255	
  1256	The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which
  1257	she had first entered the roomâthe smile of a perfectly beautiful
  1258	woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss
  1259	and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling
  1260	diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking
  1261	at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the
  1262	privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,
  1263	back, and bosomâwhich in the fashion of those days were very much
  1264	exposedâand she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as
  1265	she moved toward Anna PÃ¡vlovna. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was so lovely that not only
  1266	did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even
  1267	appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She
  1268	seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.
  1269	
  1270	âHow lovely!â said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his
  1271	shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
  1272	when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
  1273	unchanging smile.
  1274	
  1275	âMadame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,â said he,
  1276	smilingly inclining his head.
  1277	
  1278	The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
  1279	a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was
  1280	being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,
  1281	altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more
  1282	beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time
  1283	to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story
  1284	produced an effect she glanced at Anna PÃ¡vlovna, at once adopted just
  1285	the expression she saw on the maid of honorâs face, and again relapsed
  1286	into her radiant smile.
  1287	
  1288	The little princess had also left the tea table and followed HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
  1289	
  1290	âWait a moment, Iâll get my work.... Now then, what are you
  1291	thinking of?â she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. âFetch me my
  1292	workbag.â
  1293	
  1294	There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking
  1295	merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
  1296	seat.
  1297	
  1298	âNow I am all right,â she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she
  1299	took up her work.
  1300	
  1301	Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and
  1302	moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.
  1303	
  1304	Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance
  1305	to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of
  1306	this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his
  1307	sisterâs, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,
  1308	self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the
  1309	wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary
  1310	was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen
  1311	self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and
  1312	mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms
  1313	and legs always fell into unnatural positions.
  1314	
  1315	âItâs not going to be a ghost story?â said he, sitting down beside
  1316	the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
  1317	instrument he could not begin to speak.
  1318	
  1319	âWhy no, my dear fellow,â said the astonished narrator, shrugging
  1320	his shoulders.
  1321	
  1322	âBecause I hate ghost stories,â said Prince Hippolyte in a tone
  1323	which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he
  1324	had uttered them.
  1325	
  1326	He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure
  1327	whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in
  1328	a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
  1329	effrayÃ©e, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.
  1330	
  1331	The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,
  1332	to the effect that the Duc dâEnghien had gone secretly to Paris to
  1333	visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte,
  1334	who also enjoyed the famous actressâ favors, and that in his presence
  1335	Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was
  1336	subject, and was thus at the ducâs mercy. The latter spared him, and
  1337	this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.
  1338	
  1339	The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point
  1340	where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked
  1341	agitated.
  1342	
  1343	âCharming!â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna with an inquiring glance at the
  1344	little princess.
  1345	
  1346	âCharming!â whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into
  1347	her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
  1348	prevented her from going on with it.
  1349	
  1350	The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
  1351	prepared to continue, but just then Anna PÃ¡vlovna, who had kept a
  1352	watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was
  1353	talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbÃ©, so she hurried to the
  1354	rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbÃ© about
  1355	the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young
  1356	manâs simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both
  1357	were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why
  1358	Anna PÃ¡vlovna disapproved.
  1359	
  1360	âThe means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of
  1361	the people,â the abbÃ© was saying. âIt is only necessary for one
  1362	powerful nation like Russiaâbarbaric as she is said to beâto place
  1363	herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
  1364	the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the
  1365	world!â
  1366	
  1367	âBut how are you to get that balance?â Pierre was beginning.
  1368	
  1369	At that moment Anna PÃ¡vlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,
  1370	asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italianâs
  1371	face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary
  1372	expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.
  1373	
  1374	âI am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
  1375	society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had
  1376	the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of
  1377	the climate,â said he.
  1378	
  1379	Not letting the abbÃ© and Pierre escape, Anna PÃ¡vlovna, the more
  1380	conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the
  1381	larger circle.
  1382	
  1383	
  1384	
  1385	
  1386	
  1387	CHAPTER IV
  1388	
  1389	Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew
  1390	BolkÃ³nski, the little princessâ husband. He was a very handsome young
  1391	man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about
  1392	him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,
  1393	offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was
  1394	evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had
  1395	found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to
  1396	them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed
  1397	to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from
  1398	her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna
  1399	PÃ¡vlovnaâs hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.
  1400	
  1401	âYou are off to the war, Prince?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1402	
  1403	âGeneral KutÃºzov,â said BolkÃ³nski, speaking French and stressing
  1404	the last syllable of the generalâs name like a Frenchman, âhas been
  1405	pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....â
  1406	
  1407	âAnd Lise, your wife?â
  1408	
  1409	âShe will go to the country.â
  1410	
  1411	âAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?â
  1412	
  1413	âAndrÃ©,â said his wife, addressing her husband in the same
  1414	coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, âthe vicomte has
  1415	been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!â
  1416	
  1417	Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from
  1418	the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,
  1419	affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round
  1420	Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was
  1421	touching his arm, but when he saw Pierreâs beaming face he gave him an
  1422	unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.
  1423	
  1424	âThere now!... So you, too, are in the great world?â said he to
  1425	Pierre.
  1426	
  1427	âI knew you would be here,â replied Pierre. âI will come to supper
  1428	with you. May I?â he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the
  1429	vicomte who was continuing his story.
  1430	
  1431	âNo, impossible!â said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing
  1432	Pierreâs hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He
  1433	wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince VasÃ­li and his
  1434	daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.
  1435	
  1436	âYou must excuse me, dear Vicomte,â said Prince VasÃ­li to the
  1437	Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent
  1438	his rising. âThis unfortunate fete at the ambassadorâs deprives me
  1439	of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave
  1440	your enchanting party,â said he, turning to Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1441	
  1442	His daughter, Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, passed between the chairs, lightly
  1443	holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more
  1444	radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,
  1445	almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.
  1446	
  1447	âVery lovely,â said Prince Andrew.
  1448	
  1449	âVery,â said Pierre.
  1450	
  1451	In passing Prince VasÃ­li seized Pierreâs hand and said to Anna
  1452	PÃ¡vlovna: âEducate this bear for me! He has been staying with me
  1453	a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.
  1454	Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever
  1455	women.â
  1456	
  1457	
  1458	Anna PÃ¡vlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his
  1459	father to be a connection of Prince VasÃ­liâs. The elderly lady who
  1460	had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince
  1461	VasÃ­li in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed
  1462	had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety
  1463	and fear.
  1464	
  1465	âHow about my son BorÃ­s, Prince?â said she, hurrying after him into
  1466	the anteroom. âI canât remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what
  1467	news I may take back to my poor boy.â
  1468	
  1469	Although Prince VasÃ­li listened reluctantly and not very politely
  1470	to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an
  1471	ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go
  1472	away.
  1473	
  1474	âWhat would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he
  1475	would be transferred to the Guards at once?â said she.
  1476	
  1477	âBelieve me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,â answered Prince
  1478	VasÃ­li, âbut it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should
  1479	advise you to appeal to RumyÃ¡ntsev through Prince GolÃ­tsyn. That would
  1480	be the best way.â
  1481	
  1482	The elderly lady was a Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya, belonging to one of the
  1483	best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of
  1484	society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to
  1485	Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.
  1486	It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince VasÃ­li that she had obtained an
  1487	invitation to Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs reception and had sat listening to
  1488	the vicomteâs story. Prince VasÃ­liâs words frightened her, an
  1489	embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;
  1490	then she smiled again and clutched Prince VasÃ­liâs arm more tightly.
  1491	
  1492	âListen to me, Prince,â said she. âI have never yet asked you
  1493	for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my
  1494	fatherâs friendship for you; but now I entreat you for Godâs sake to
  1495	do this for my sonâand I shall always regard you as a benefactor,â
  1496	she added hurriedly. âNo, donât be angry, but promise! I have asked
  1497	GolÃ­tsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,â
  1498	she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.
  1499	
  1500	âPapa, we shall be late,â said Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, turning her
  1501	beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she
  1502	stood waiting by the door.
  1503	
  1504	Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized
  1505	if it is to last. Prince VasÃ­li knew this, and having once realized
  1506	that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be
  1507	unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But
  1508	in Princess DrubetskÃ¡yaâs case he felt, after her second appeal,
  1509	something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was
  1510	quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in
  1511	his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of
  1512	those womenâmostly mothersâwho, having once made up their minds,
  1513	will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if
  1514	necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even
  1515	to make scenes. This last consideration moved him.
  1516	
  1517	âMy dear Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,â said he with his usual familiarity and
  1518	weariness of tone, âit is almost impossible for me to do what you
  1519	ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your fatherâs
  1520	memory, I will do the impossibleâyour son shall be transferred to the
  1521	Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?â
  1522	
  1523	âMy dear benefactor! This is what I expected from youâI knew your
  1524	kindness!â He turned to go.
  1525	
  1526	âWaitâjust a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...â
  1527	she faltered. âYou are on good terms with Michael IlariÃ³novich
  1528	KutÃºzov ... recommend BorÃ­s to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at
  1529	rest, and then...â
  1530	
  1531	Prince VasÃ­li smiled.
  1532	
  1533	âNo, I wonât promise that. You donât know how KutÃºzov is pestered
  1534	since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that
  1535	all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as
  1536	adjutants.â
  1537	
  1538	âNo, but do promise! I wonât let you go! My dear benefactor...â
  1539	
  1540	âPapa,â said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,
  1541	âwe shall be late.â
  1542	
  1543	âWell, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?â
  1544	
  1545	âThen tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?â
  1546	
  1547	âCertainly; but about KutÃºzov, I donât promise.â
  1548	
  1549	âDo promise, do promise, VasÃ­li!â cried Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna as he
  1550	went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably
  1551	came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.
  1552	
  1553	Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed
  1554	all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face
  1555	resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the
  1556	group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to
  1557	listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was
  1558	accomplished.
  1559	
  1560	
  1561	
  1562	
  1563	
  1564	CHAPTER V
  1565	
  1566	âAnd what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at
  1567	Milan?â asked Anna PÃ¡vlovna, âand of the comedy of the people of
  1568	Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and
  1569	Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of
  1570	the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make oneâs head whirl! It is as
  1571	if the whole world had gone crazy.â
  1572	
  1573	Prince Andrew looked Anna PÃ¡vlovna straight in the face with a
  1574	sarcastic smile.
  1575	
  1576	ââDieu me la donne, gare Ã  qui la touche!ââ * They say he was
  1577	very fine when he said that,â he remarked, repeating the words in
  1578	Italian: ââDio mi lâha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!ââ
  1579	
  1580	     * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!
  1581	
  1582	âI hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
  1583	over,â Anna PÃ¡vlovna continued. âThe sovereigns will not be able to
  1584	endure this man who is a menace to everything.â
  1585	
  1586	âThe sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,â said the vicomte, polite
  1587	but hopeless: âThe sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis
  1588	XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!â and he became
  1589	more animated. âAnd believe me, they are reaping the reward of their
  1590	betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending
  1591	ambassadors to compliment the usurper.â
  1592	
  1593	And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.
  1594	
  1595	Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
  1596	through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the
  1597	little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the CondÃ©
  1598	coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity
  1599	as if she had asked him to do it.
  1600	
  1601	âBÃ¢ton de gueules, engrÃªlÃ© de gueules dâazurâmaison CondÃ©,â
  1602	said he.
  1603	
  1604	The princess listened, smiling.
  1605	
  1606	âIf Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,â the
  1607	vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
  1608	he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but
  1609	follows the current of his own thoughts, âthings will have gone too
  1610	far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French societyâI
  1611	mean good French societyâwill have been forever destroyed, and
  1612	then....â
  1613	
  1614	He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to
  1615	make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna PÃ¡vlovna,
  1616	who had him under observation, interrupted:
  1617	
  1618	âThe Emperor Alexander,â said she, with the melancholy which
  1619	always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, âhas
  1620	declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose
  1621	their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the
  1622	usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms
  1623	of its rightful king,â she concluded, trying to be amiable to the
  1624	royalist emigrant.
  1625	
  1626	âThat is doubtful,â said Prince Andrew. âMonsieur le Vicomte quite
  1627	rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will
  1628	be difficult to return to the old regime.â
  1629	
  1630	âFrom what I have heard,â said Pierre, blushing and breaking into
  1631	the conversation, âalmost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
  1632	Bonaparteâs side.â
  1633	
  1634	âIt is the Buonapartists who say that,â replied the vicomte without
  1635	looking at Pierre. âAt the present time it is difficult to know the
  1636	real state of French public opinion.â
  1637	
  1638	âBonaparte has said so,â remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic
  1639	smile.
  1640	
  1641	It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
  1642	remarks at him, though without looking at him.
  1643	
  1644	ââI showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow
  1645	it,ââ Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting
  1646	Napoleonâs words. ââI opened my antechambers and they crowded
  1647	in.â I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.â
  1648	
  1649	âNot in the least,â replied the vicomte. âAfter the murder of the
  1650	duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some
  1651	people,â he went on, turning to Anna PÃ¡vlovna, âhe ever was a hero,
  1652	after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
  1653	hero less on earth.â
  1654	
  1655	Before Anna PÃ¡vlovna and the others had time to smile their
  1656	appreciation of the vicomteâs epigram, Pierre again broke into the
  1657	conversation, and though Anna PÃ¡vlovna felt sure he would say something
  1658	inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.
  1659	
  1660	âThe execution of the Duc dâEnghien,â declared Monsieur Pierre,
  1661	âwas a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon
  1662	showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole
  1663	responsibility of that deed.â
  1664	
  1665	âDieu! Mon Dieu!â muttered Anna PÃ¡vlovna in a terrified whisper.
  1666	
  1667	âWhat, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows
  1668	greatness of soul?â said the little princess, smiling and drawing her
  1669	work nearer to her.
  1670	
  1671	âOh! Oh!â exclaimed several voices.
  1672	
  1673	âCapital!â said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his
  1674	knee with the palm of his hand.
  1675	
  1676	The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his
  1677	audience over his spectacles and continued.
  1678	
  1679	âI say so,â he continued desperately, âbecause the Bourbons fled
  1680	from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone
  1681	understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,
  1682	he could not stop short for the sake of one manâs life.â
  1683	
  1684	âWonât you come over to the other table?â suggested Anna
  1685	PÃ¡vlovna.
  1686	
  1687	But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.
  1688	
  1689	âNo,â cried he, becoming more and more eager, âNapoleon is great
  1690	because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,
  1691	preserved all that was good in itâequality of citizenship and freedom
  1692	of speech and of the pressâand only for that reason did he obtain
  1693	power.â
  1694	
  1695	âYes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to
  1696	commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have
  1697	called him a great man,â remarked the vicomte.
  1698	
  1699	âHe could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might
  1700	rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great
  1701	man. The Revolution was a grand thing!â continued Monsieur Pierre,
  1702	betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme
  1703	youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.
  1704	
  1705	âWhat? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...
  1706	But wonât you come to this other table?â repeated Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
  1707	
  1708	âRousseauâs Contrat Social,â said the vicomte with a tolerant
  1709	smile.
  1710	
  1711	âI am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.â
  1712	
  1713	âYes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,â again interjected an
  1714	ironical voice.
  1715	
  1716	âThose were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most
  1717	important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from
  1718	prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon
  1719	has retained in full force.â
  1720	
  1721	âLiberty and equality,â said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at
  1722	last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words
  1723	were, âhigh-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does
  1724	not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and
  1725	equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the
  1726	contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.â
  1727	
  1728	Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the
  1729	vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of
  1730	Pierreâs outburst Anna PÃ¡vlovna, despite her social experience, was
  1731	horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierreâs sacrilegious words
  1732	had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was
  1733	impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
  1734	a vigorous attack on the orator.
  1735	
  1736	âBut, my dear Monsieur Pierre,â said she, âhow do you explain the
  1737	fact of a great man executing a ducâor even an ordinary man whoâis
  1738	innocent and untried?â
  1739	
  1740	âI should like,â said the vicomte, âto ask how monsieur explains
  1741	the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not
  1742	at all like the conduct of a great man!â
  1743	
  1744	âAnd the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!â said the
  1745	little princess, shrugging her shoulders.
  1746	
  1747	âHeâs a low fellow, say what you will,â remarked Prince Hippolyte.
  1748	
  1749	Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His
  1750	smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,
  1751	his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by
  1752	anotherâa childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to
  1753	ask forgiveness.
  1754	
  1755	The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that
  1756	this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were
  1757	silent.
  1758	
  1759	âHow do you expect him to answer you all at once?â said Prince
  1760	Andrew. âBesides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish
  1761	between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.
  1762	So it seems to me.â
  1763	
  1764	âYes, yes, of course!â Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of
  1765	this reinforcement.
  1766	
  1767	âOne must admit,â continued Prince Andrew, âthat Napoleon as a man
  1768	was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he
  1769	gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts
  1770	which it is difficult to justify.â
  1771	
  1772	Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
  1773	Pierreâs remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
  1774	go.
  1775	
  1776	Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,
  1777	and asking them all to be seated began:
  1778	
  1779	âI was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.
  1780	Excuse me, VicomteâI must tell it in Russian or the point will be
  1781	lost....â And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
  1782	as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.
  1783	Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
  1784	attention to his story.
  1785	
  1786	âThere is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must
  1787	have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her
  1788	taste. And she had a ladyâs maid, also big. She said....â
  1789	
  1790	Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
  1791	difficulty.
  1792	
  1793	âShe said.... Oh yes! She said, âGirl,â to the maid, âput on a
  1794	livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some
  1795	calls.ââ
  1796	
  1797	Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
  1798	audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several
  1799	persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna PÃ¡vlovna, did however
  1800	smile.
  1801	
  1802	âShe went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and
  1803	her long hair came down....â Here he could contain himself no
  1804	longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: âAnd the whole world
  1805	knew....â
  1806	
  1807	And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told
  1808	it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna PÃ¡vlovna and the
  1809	others appreciated Prince Hippolyteâs social tact in so agreeably
  1810	ending Pierreâs unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote
  1811	the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last
  1812	and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and
  1813	where.
  1814	
  1815	
  1816	
  1817	
  1818	
  1819	CHAPTER VI
  1820	
  1821	Having thanked Anna PÃ¡vlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began
  1822	to take their leave.
  1823	
  1824	Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge
  1825	red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing
  1826	room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something
  1827	particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was
  1828	absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the
  1829	generalâs three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume,
  1830	till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and
  1831	inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by
  1832	his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna PÃ¡vlovna turned toward
  1833	him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his
  1834	indiscretion, nodded and said: âI hope to see you again, but I also
  1835	hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.â
  1836	
  1837	When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody
  1838	saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, âOpinions are
  1839	opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.â And
  1840	everyone, including Anna PÃ¡vlovna, felt this.
  1841	
  1842	Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders
  1843	to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened
  1844	indifferently to his wifeâs chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also
  1845	come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant
  1846	princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.
  1847	
  1848	âGo in, Annette, or you will catch cold,â said the little princess,
  1849	taking leave of Anna PÃ¡vlovna. âIt is settled,â she added in a low
  1850	voice.
  1851	
  1852	Anna PÃ¡vlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she
  1853	contemplated between Anatole and the little princessâ sister-in-law.
  1854	
  1855	âI rely on you, my dear,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, also in a low tone.
  1856	âWrite to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au
  1857	revoir! ââand she left the hall.
  1858	
  1859	Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face
  1860	close to her, began to whisper something.
  1861	
  1862	Two footmen, the princessâ and his own, stood holding a shawl and
  1863	a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to
  1864	the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
  1865	understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual
  1866	spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.
  1867	
  1868	âI am very glad I did not go to the ambassadorâs,â said Prince
  1869	Hippolyte ââso dullâ. It has been a delightful evening, has it
  1870	not? Delightful!â
  1871	
  1872	âThey say the ball will be very good,â replied the princess, drawing
  1873	up her downy little lip. âAll the pretty women in society will be
  1874	there.â
  1875	
  1876	âNot all, for you will not be there; not all,â said Prince Hippolyte
  1877	smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he
  1878	even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from
  1879	awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the
  1880	shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as
  1881	though embracing her.
  1882	
  1883	Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her
  1884	husband. Prince Andrewâs eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he
  1885	seem.
  1886	
  1887	âAre you ready?â he asked his wife, looking past her.
  1888	
  1889	Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion
  1890	reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch
  1891	following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.
  1892	
  1893	âPrincesse, au revoir,â cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well
  1894	as with his feet.
  1895	
  1896	The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark
  1897	carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under
  1898	pretense of helping, was in everyoneâs way.
  1899	
  1900	âAllow me, sir,â said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,
  1901	disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.
  1902	
  1903	âI am expecting you, Pierre,â said the same voice, but gently and
  1904	affectionately.
  1905	
  1906	The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte
  1907	laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
  1908	whom he had promised to take home.
  1909	
  1910	âWell, mon cher,â said the vicomte, having seated himself beside
  1911	Hippolyte in the carriage, âyour little princess is very nice, very
  1912	nice indeed, quite French,â and he kissed the tips of his fingers.
  1913	Hippolyte burst out laughing.
  1914	
  1915	âDo you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,â
  1916	continued the vicomte. âI pity the poor husband, that little officer
  1917	who gives himself the airs of a monarch.â
  1918	
  1919	Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, âAnd you were
  1920	saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to
  1921	know how to deal with them.â
  1922	
  1923	Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrewâs study like
  1924	one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took
  1925	from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesarâs
  1926	Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.
  1927	
  1928	âWhat have you done to Mlle SchÃ©rer? She will be quite ill now,â
  1929	said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white
  1930	hands.
  1931	
  1932	Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager
  1933	face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.
  1934	
  1935	âThat abbÃ© is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
  1936	right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible butâI do not
  1937	know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....â
  1938	
  1939	It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract
  1940	conversation.
  1941	
  1942	âOne canât everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have
  1943	you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a
  1944	diplomatist?â asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.
  1945	
  1946	Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.
  1947	
  1948	âReally, I donât yet know. I donât like either the one or the
  1949	other.â
  1950	
  1951	âBut you must decide on something! Your father expects it.â
  1952	
  1953	Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbÃ© as tutor,
  1954	and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow
  1955	his father dismissed the abbÃ© and said to the young man, âNow go
  1956	to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to
  1957	anything. Here is a letter to Prince VasÃ­li, and here is money. Write
  1958	to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.â Pierre had
  1959	already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided
  1960	on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.
  1961	Pierre rubbed his forehead.
  1962	
  1963	âBut he must be a Freemason,â said he, referring to the abbÃ© whom
  1964	he had met that evening.
  1965	
  1966	âThat is all nonsense.â Prince Andrew again interrupted him, âlet
  1967	us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?â
  1968	
  1969	âNo, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted
  1970	to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for
  1971	freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army;
  1972	but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is
  1973	not right.â
  1974	
  1975	Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierreâs childish words.
  1976	He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such
  1977	nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other
  1978	answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naÃ¯ve question.
  1979	
  1980	âIf no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no
  1981	wars,â he said.
  1982	
  1983	âAnd that would be splendid,â said Pierre.
  1984	
  1985	Prince Andrew smiled ironically.
  1986	
  1987	âVery likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....â
  1988	
  1989	âWell, why are you going to the war?â asked Pierre.
  1990	
  1991	âWhat for? I donât know. I must. Besides that I am going....â He
  1992	paused. âI am going because the life I am leading here does not suit
  1993	me!â
  1994	
  1995	
  1996	
  1997	
  1998	
  1999	CHAPTER VII
  2000	
  2001	The rustle of a womanâs dress was heard in the next room. Prince
  2002	Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it
  2003	had had in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from
  2004	the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house
  2005	dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely
  2006	placed a chair for her.
  2007	
  2008	âHow is it,â she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly
  2009	and fussily in the easy chair, âhow is it Annette never got married?
  2010	How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying
  2011	so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you
  2012	are, Monsieur Pierre!â
  2013	
  2014	âAnd I am still arguing with your husband. I canât understand why he
  2015	wants to go to the war,â replied Pierre, addressing the princess
  2016	with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
  2017	intercourse with young women.
  2018	
  2019	The princess started. Evidently Pierreâs words touched her to the
  2020	quick.
  2021	
  2022	âAh, that is just what I tell him!â said she. âI donât
  2023	understand it; I donât in the least understand why men canât live
  2024	without wars. How is it that we women donât want anything of the kind,
  2025	donât need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here
  2026	he is Uncleâs aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so
  2027	well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the
  2028	AprÃ¡ksinsâ I heard a lady asking, âIs that the famous Prince
  2029	Andrew?â I did indeed.â She laughed. âHe is so well received
  2030	everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know
  2031	the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of
  2032	how to arrange it. What do you think?â
  2033	
  2034	Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
  2035	conversation, gave no reply.
  2036	
  2037	âWhen are you starting?â he asked.
  2038	
  2039	âOh, donât speak of his going, donât! I wonât hear it spoken
  2040	of,â said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which
  2041	she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly
  2042	ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.
  2043	âToday when I remembered that all these delightful associations
  2044	must be broken off ... and then you know, AndrÃ©...â (she looked
  2045	significantly at her husband) âIâm afraid, Iâm afraid!â she
  2046	whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.
  2047	
  2048	Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides
  2049	Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of
  2050	frigid politeness.
  2051	
  2052	âWhat is it you are afraid of, Lise? I donât understand,â said he.
  2053	
  2054	âThere, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim
  2055	of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone
  2056	in the country.â
  2057	
  2058	âWith my father and sister, remember,â said Prince Andrew gently.
  2059	
  2060	âAlone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to
  2061	be afraid.â
  2062	
  2063	Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a
  2064	joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she
  2065	felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the
  2066	gist of the matter lay in that.
  2067	
  2068	âI still canât understand what you are afraid of,â said Prince
  2069	Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.
  2070	
  2071	The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.
  2072	
  2073	âNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....â
  2074	
  2075	âYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,â said Prince Andrew.
  2076	âYou had better go.â
  2077	
  2078	The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.
  2079	Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.
  2080	
  2081	Pierre looked over his spectacles with naÃ¯ve surprise, now at him and
  2082	now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.
  2083	
  2084	âWhy should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?â exclaimed the little
  2085	princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful
  2086	grimace. âI have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed
  2087	so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no
  2088	pity for me. Why is it?â
  2089	
  2090	âLise!â was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed
  2091	an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself
  2092	regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:
  2093	
  2094	âYou treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave
  2095	like that six months ago?â
  2096	
  2097	âLise, I beg you to desist,â said Prince Andrew still more
  2098	emphatically.
  2099	
  2100	Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
  2101	all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the
  2102	sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.
  2103	
  2104	âCalm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you
  2105	I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me!
  2106	An outsider is out of place here.... No, donât distress yourself....
  2107	Good-by!â
  2108	
  2109	Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.
  2110	
  2111	âNo, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of
  2112	the pleasure of spending the evening with you.â
  2113	
  2114	âNo, he thinks only of himself,â muttered the princess without
  2115	restraining her angry tears.
  2116	
  2117	âLise!â said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch
  2118	which indicates that patience is exhausted.
  2119	
  2120	Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princessâ pretty
  2121	face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes
  2122	glanced askance at her husbandâs face, and her own assumed the timid,
  2123	deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
  2124	drooping tail.
  2125	
  2126	âMon Dieu, mon Dieu!â she muttered, and lifting her dress with one
  2127	hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.
  2128	
  2129	âGood night, Lise,â said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand
  2130	as he would have done to a stranger.
  2131	
  2132	
  2133	
  2134	
  2135	
  2136	CHAPTER VIII
  2137	
  2138	The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre
  2139	continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead
  2140	with his small hand.
  2141	
  2142	âLet us go and have supper,â he said with a sigh, going to the door.
  2143	
  2144	They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.
  2145	Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore
  2146	that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.
  2147	Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,
  2148	with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on
  2149	his face, began to talkâas one who has long had something on his mind
  2150	and suddenly determines to speak out.
  2151	
  2152	âNever, never marry, my dear fellow! Thatâs my advice: never marry
  2153	till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of,
  2154	and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen
  2155	her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
  2156	mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothingâor all that is
  2157	good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles.
  2158	Yes! Yes! Yes! Donât look at me with such surprise. If you marry
  2159	expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every
  2160	step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing
  2161	room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
  2162	idiot!... But whatâs the good?...â and he waved his arm.
  2163	
  2164	Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and
  2165	the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend
  2166	in amazement.
  2167	
  2168	âMy wife,â continued Prince Andrew, âis an excellent woman, one
  2169	of those rare women with whom a manâs honor is safe; but, O God, what
  2170	would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to
  2171	whom I mention this, because I like you.â
  2172	
  2173	As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that BolkÃ³nski
  2174	who had lolled in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs easy chairs and with half-closed
  2175	eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his
  2176	thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which
  2177	the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant
  2178	light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary
  2179	times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid
  2180	irritation.
  2181	
  2182	âYou donât understand why I say this,â he continued, âbut it is
  2183	the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,â said
  2184	he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), âbut Bonaparte when
  2185	he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing
  2186	but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with
  2187	a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you
  2188	have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
  2189	regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and trivialityâthese are
  2190	the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war,
  2191	the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for
  2192	nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,â continued Prince
  2193	Andrew, âand at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs they listen to me. And that stupid
  2194	set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only
  2195	knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is
  2196	right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everythingâthatâs what
  2197	women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them
  2198	in society it seems as if there were something in them, but thereâs
  2199	nothing, nothing, nothing! No, donât marry, my dear fellow; donât
  2200	marry!â concluded Prince Andrew.
  2201	
  2202	âIt seems funny to me,â said Pierre, âthat you, you should
  2203	consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have
  2204	everything before you, everything. And you....â
  2205	
  2206	He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he
  2207	thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.
  2208	
  2209	âHow can he talk like that?â thought Pierre. He considered his
  2210	friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the
  2211	highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might
  2212	be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at
  2213	Prince Andrewâs calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary
  2214	memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything,
  2215	and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for
  2216	work and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrewâs lack
  2217	of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was
  2218	particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a
  2219	sign of strength.
  2220	
  2221	Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise
  2222	and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels
  2223	that they may run smoothly.
  2224	
  2225	âMy part is played out,â said Prince Andrew. âWhatâs the use of
  2226	talking about me? Let us talk about you,â he added after a silence,
  2227	smiling at his reassuring thoughts.
  2228	
  2229	That smile was immediately reflected on Pierreâs face.
  2230	
  2231	âBut what is there to say about me?â said Pierre, his face relaxing
  2232	into a careless, merry smile. âWhat am I? An illegitimate son!â
  2233	He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great
  2234	effort to say this. âWithout a name and without means... And it
  2235	really...â But he did not say what âit reallyâ was. âFor the
  2236	present I am free and am all right. Only I havenât the least idea what
  2237	I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.â
  2238	
  2239	Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glanceâfriendly and
  2240	affectionate as it wasâexpressed a sense of his own superiority.
  2241	
  2242	âI am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our
  2243	whole set. Yes, youâre all right! Choose what you will; itâs all the
  2244	same. Youâll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting
  2245	those KurÃ¡gins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so
  2246	badlyâall this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!â
  2247	
  2248	âWhat would you have, my dear fellow?â answered Pierre, shrugging
  2249	his shoulders. âWomen, my dear fellow; women!â
  2250	
  2251	âI donât understand it,â replied Prince Andrew. âWomen who are
  2252	comme il faut, thatâs a different matter; but the KurÃ¡ginsâ set of
  2253	women, âwomen and wineâ I donât understand!â
  2254	
  2255	Pierre was staying at Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡ginâs and sharing the
  2256	dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to
  2257	reform by marrying him to Prince Andrewâs sister.
  2258	
  2259	âDo you know?â said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy
  2260	thought, âseriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such
  2261	a life I canât decide or think properly about anything. Oneâs head
  2262	aches, and one spends all oneâs money. He asked me for tonight, but I
  2263	wonât go.â
  2264	
  2265	âYou give me your word of honor not to go?â
  2266	
  2267	âOn my honor!â
  2268	
  2269	
  2270	
  2271	
  2272	
  2273	CHAPTER IX
  2274	
  2275	It was past one oâclock when Pierre left his friend. It was a
  2276	cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending
  2277	to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he
  2278	felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light
  2279	enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like
  2280	morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole
  2281	KurÃ¡gin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which
  2282	there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind
  2283	Pierre was very fond of.
  2284	
  2285	âI should like to go to KurÃ¡ginâs,â thought he.
  2286	
  2287	But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go
  2288	there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
  2289	passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
  2290	that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his
  2291	promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it
  2292	he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering;
  2293	âbesides,â thought he, âall such âwords of honorâ are
  2294	conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if
  2295	one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so
  2296	extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the
  2297	same!â Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying
  2298	all his decisions and intentions. He went to KurÃ¡ginâs.
  2299	
  2300	Reaching the large house near the Horse Guardsâ barracks, in which
  2301	Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,
  2302	and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty
  2303	bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of
  2304	alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.
  2305	
  2306	Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.
  2307	Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the
  2308	remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on
  2309	the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of
  2310	laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and
  2311	general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
  2312	round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one
  2313	pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.
  2314	
  2315	âI bet a hundred on Stevens!â shouted one.
  2316	
  2317	âMind, no holding on!â cried another.
  2318	
  2319	âI bet on DÃ³lokhov!â cried a third. âKurÃ¡gin, you part our
  2320	hands.â
  2321	
  2322	âThere, leave Bruin alone; hereâs a bet on.â
  2323	
  2324	âAt one draught, or he loses!â shouted a fourth.
  2325	
  2326	âJacob, bring a bottle!â shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow
  2327	who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine
  2328	linen shirt unfastened in front. âWait a bit, you fellows.... Here is
  2329	PÃ©tya! Good man!â cried he, addressing Pierre.
  2330	
  2331	Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,
  2332	particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober
  2333	ring, cried from the window: âCome here; part the bets!â This was
  2334	DÃ³lokhov, an officer of the SemÃ«nov regiment, a notorious gambler and
  2335	duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him
  2336	merrily.
  2337	
  2338	âI donât understand. Whatâs it all about?â
  2339	
  2340	âWait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,â said Anatole, and
  2341	taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.
  2342	
  2343	âFirst of all you must drink!â
  2344	
  2345	Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at
  2346	the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening
  2347	to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierreâs glass while
  2348	explaining that DÃ³lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval
  2349	officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
  2350	of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.
  2351	
  2352	âGo on, you must drink it all,â said Anatole, giving Pierre the last
  2353	glass, âor I wonât let you go!â
  2354	
  2355	âNo, I wonât,â said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up
  2356	to the window.
  2357	
  2358	DÃ³lokhov was holding the Englishmanâs hand and clearly and distinctly
  2359	repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to
  2360	Anatole and Pierre.
  2361	
  2362	DÃ³lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He
  2363	was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache,
  2364	so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly
  2365	seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle
  2366	of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
  2367	lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually
  2368	round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute,
  2369	insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it
  2370	impossible not to notice his face. DÃ³lokhov was a man of small means
  2371	and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of
  2372	rubles, DÃ³lokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a
  2373	footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him
  2374	more than they did Anatole. DÃ³lokhov could play all games and nearly
  2375	always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.
  2376	Both KurÃ¡gin and DÃ³lokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes
  2377	and scapegraces of Petersburg.
  2378	
  2379	The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone
  2380	from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who
  2381	were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
  2382	the gentlemen around.
  2383	
  2384	Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to
  2385	smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
  2386	could not move it. He smashed a pane.
  2387	
  2388	âYou have a try, Hercules,â said he, turning to Pierre.
  2389	
  2390	Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with
  2391	a crash.
  2392	
  2393	âTake it right out, or theyâll think Iâm holding on,â said
  2394	DÃ³lokhov.
  2395	
  2396	âIs the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?â said Anatole.
  2397	
  2398	âFirst-rate,â said Pierre, looking at DÃ³lokhov, who with a bottle
  2399	of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of
  2400	the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.
  2401	
  2402	DÃ³lokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window
  2403	sill. âListen!â cried he, standing there and addressing those in the
  2404	room. All were silent.
  2405	
  2406	âI bet fifty imperialsââhe spoke French that the Englishman might
  2407	understand him, but he did not speak it very wellââI bet fifty
  2408	imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?â added he,
  2409	addressing the Englishman.
  2410	
  2411	âNo, fifty,â replied the latter.
  2412	
  2413	âAll right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of
  2414	rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this
  2415	spotâ (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window)
  2416	âand without holding on to anything. Is that right?â
  2417	
  2418	âQuite right,â said the Englishman.
  2419	
  2420	Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
  2421	of his coat and looking down at himâthe Englishman was shortâbegan
  2422	repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.
  2423	
  2424	âWait!â cried DÃ³lokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window
  2425	sill to attract attention. âWait a bit, KurÃ¡gin. Listen! If
  2426	anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you
  2427	understand?â
  2428	
  2429	The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to
  2430	accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though
  2431	he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating
  2432	DÃ³lokhovâs words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the
  2433	Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window
  2434	sill, leaned over, and looked down.
  2435	
  2436	âOh! Oh! Oh!â he muttered, looking down from the window at the
  2437	stones of the pavement.
  2438	
  2439	âShut up!â cried DÃ³lokhov, pushing him away from the window. The
  2440	lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.
  2441	
  2442	Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,
  2443	DÃ³lokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered
  2444	his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself
  2445	on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to
  2446	the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and
  2447	placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.
  2448	DÃ³lokhovâs back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit
  2449	up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in
  2450	front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others
  2451	present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted
  2452	to seize hold of DÃ³lokhovâs shirt.
  2453	
  2454	âI say, this is folly! Heâll be killed,â said this more sensible
  2455	man.
  2456	
  2457	Anatole stopped him.
  2458	
  2459	âDonât touch him! Youâll startle him and then heâll be killed.
  2460	Eh?... What then?... Eh?â
  2461	
  2462	DÃ³lokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged
  2463	himself on his seat.
  2464	
  2465	âIf anyone comes meddling again,â said he, emitting the words
  2466	separately through his thin compressed lips, âI will throw him down
  2467	there. Now then!â
  2468	
  2469	Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle
  2470	and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand
  2471	to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
  2472	broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
  2473	window and from DÃ³lokhovâs back. Anatole stood erect with staring
  2474	eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man
  2475	who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw
  2476	himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from
  2477	which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed
  2478	horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes.
  2479	DÃ³lokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown
  2480	further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand
  2481	holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the
  2482	effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher
  2483	and his head tilting yet further back. âWhy is it so long?â thought
  2484	Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.
  2485	Suddenly DÃ³lokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm
  2486	trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip
  2487	as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and
  2488	arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch
  2489	the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered
  2490	his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was
  2491	aware of a stir all around. He looked up: DÃ³lokhov was standing on the
  2492	window sill, with a pale but radiant face.
  2493	
  2494	âItâs empty.â
  2495	
  2496	He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. DÃ³lokhov
  2497	jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.
  2498	
  2499	âWell done!... Fine fellow!... Thereâs a bet for you!... Devil take
  2500	you!â came from different sides.
  2501	
  2502	The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.
  2503	DÃ³lokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the
  2504	window sill.
  2505	
  2506	âGentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? Iâll do the same thing!â
  2507	he suddenly cried. âEven without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a
  2508	bottle. Iâll do it.... Bring a bottle!â
  2509	
  2510	âLet him do it, let him do it,â said DÃ³lokhov, smiling.
  2511	
  2512	âWhat next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go
  2513	giddy even on a staircase,â exclaimed several voices.
  2514	
  2515	âIâll drink it! Letâs have a bottle of rum!â shouted Pierre,
  2516	banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to
  2517	climb out of the window.
  2518	
  2519	They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who
  2520	touched him was sent flying.
  2521	
  2522	âNo, youâll never manage him that way,â said Anatole. âWait a
  2523	bit and Iâll get round him.... Listen! Iâll take your bet tomorrow,
  2524	but now we are all going to âââs.â
  2525	
  2526	âCome on then,â cried Pierre. âCome on!... And weâll take Bruin
  2527	with us.â
  2528	
  2529	And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,
  2530	and began dancing round the room with it.
  2531	
  2532	
  2533	
  2534	
  2535	
  2536	CHAPTER X
  2537	
  2538	Prince VasÃ­li kept the promise he had given to Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya
  2539	who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son BorÃ­s on the evening of
  2540	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an
  2541	exception made, and BorÃ­s transferred into the regiment of SemÃ«nov
  2542	Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment
  2543	to KutÃºzovâs staff despite all Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs endeavors and
  2544	entreaties. Soon after Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs reception Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
  2545	returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the
  2546	RostÃ³vs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling
  2547	BÃ³ry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being
  2548	at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from
  2549	childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left
  2550	Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in
  2551	Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to RadzivÃ­lov.
  2552	
  2553	It was St. Nataliaâs day and the name day of two of the RostÃ³vsâthe
  2554	mother and the youngest daughterâboth named Nataly. Ever since
  2555	the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going
  2556	continually, bringing visitors to the Countess RostÃ³vaâs big house on
  2557	the PovarskÃ¡ya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and
  2558	her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors
  2559	who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in
  2560	relays.
  2561	
  2562	The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type
  2563	of face, evidently worn out with childbearingâshe had had twelve.
  2564	A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a
  2565	distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
  2566	DrubetskÃ¡ya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the
  2567	drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young
  2568	people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to
  2569	take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw
  2570	them off, inviting them all to dinner.
  2571	
  2572	âI am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,â or âma chÃ¨reââhe
  2573	called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation
  2574	in his tone, âmy dear,â whether they were above or below him in
  2575	rankââI thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name
  2576	day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended,
  2577	ma chÃ¨re! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!â
  2578	These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and
  2579	with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the
  2580	same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As
  2581	soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were
  2582	still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily
  2583	spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air
  2584	of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and
  2585	fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on
  2586	questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but
  2587	self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in
  2588	the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking
  2589	his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.
  2590	Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the
  2591	conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables
  2592	were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who
  2593	were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask
  2594	table linen, he would call DmÃ­tri VasÃ­levich, a man of good family and
  2595	the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the
  2596	enormous table would say: âWell, DmÃ­tri, youâll see that things are
  2597	all as they should be? Thatâs right! The great thing is the serving,
  2598	thatâs it.â And with a complacent sigh he would return to the
  2599	drawing room.
  2600	
  2601	âMÃ¡rya LvÃ³vna KarÃ¡gina and her daughter!â announced the
  2602	countessâ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing
  2603	room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold
  2604	snuffbox with her husbandâs portrait on it.
  2605	
  2606	âIâm quite worn out by these callers. However, Iâll see her and
  2607	no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,â she said to the footman in a
  2608	sad voice, as if saying: âVery well, finish me off.â
  2609	
  2610	A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling
  2611	daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.
  2612	
  2613	âDear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ...
  2614	at the RazumÃ³vskiâs ball ... and Countess AprÃ¡ksina ... I was
  2615	so delighted...â came the sounds of animated feminine voices,
  2616	interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and
  2617	the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last
  2618	out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses
  2619	and say, âI am so delighted... Mammaâs health... and Countess
  2620	AprÃ¡ksina...â and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put
  2621	on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief
  2622	topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of
  2623	Catherineâs day, Count BezÃºkhov, and about his illegitimate son
  2624	Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs
  2625	reception.
  2626	
  2627	âI am so sorry for the poor count,â said the visitor. âHe is in
  2628	such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill
  2629	him!â
  2630	
  2631	âWhat is that?â asked the countess as if she did not know what the
  2632	visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of
  2633	Count BezÃºkhovâs distress some fifteen times.
  2634	
  2635	âThatâs what comes of a modern education,â exclaimed the visitor.
  2636	âIt seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do
  2637	as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible
  2638	things that he has been expelled by the police.â
  2639	
  2640	âYou donât say so!â replied the countess.
  2641	
  2642	âHe chose his friends badly,â interposed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna.
  2643	âPrince VasÃ­liâs son, he, and a certain DÃ³lokhov have, it is said,
  2644	been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.
  2645	DÃ³lokhov has been degraded to the ranks and BezÃºkhovâs son sent
  2646	back to Moscow. Anatole KurÃ¡ginâs father managed somehow to get his
  2647	sonâs affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.â
  2648	
  2649	âBut what have they been up to?â asked the countess.
  2650	
  2651	âThey are regular brigands, especially DÃ³lokhov,â replied the
  2652	visitor. âHe is a son of MÃ¡rya IvÃ¡novna DÃ³lokhova, such a worthy
  2653	woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere,
  2654	put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The
  2655	police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied
  2656	a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka
  2657	Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his
  2658	back!â
  2659	
  2660	âWhat a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!â shouted
  2661	the count, dying with laughter.
  2662	
  2663	âOh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?â
  2664	
  2665	Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.
  2666	
  2667	âIt was all they could do to rescue the poor man,â continued the
  2668	visitor. âAnd to think it is Cyril VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhovâs son
  2669	who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so
  2670	well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has
  2671	done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in
  2672	spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite
  2673	declined: I have my daughters to consider.â
  2674	
  2675	âWhy do you say this young man is so rich?â asked the countess,
  2676	turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention.
  2677	âHis children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is
  2678	illegitimate.â
  2679	
  2680	The visitor made a gesture with her hand.
  2681	
  2682	âI should think he has a score of them.â
  2683	
  2684	Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently
  2685	wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in
  2686	society.
  2687	
  2688	âThe fact of the matter is,â said she significantly, and also in a
  2689	half whisper, âeveryone knows Count Cyrilâs reputation.... He has
  2690	lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.â
  2691	
  2692	âHow handsome the old man still was only a year ago!â remarked the
  2693	countess. âI have never seen a handsomer man.â
  2694	
  2695	âHe is very much altered now,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âWell, as
  2696	I was saying, Prince VasÃ­li is the next heir through his wife, but the
  2697	count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to
  2698	the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his deathâand he is
  2699	so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from
  2700	Petersburgâno one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre
  2701	or Prince VasÃ­li. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know
  2702	it all very well for Prince VasÃ­li told me himself. Besides, Cyril
  2703	VladÃ­mirovich is my motherâs second cousin. Heâs also my BÃ³ryâs
  2704	godfather,â she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the
  2705	fact.
  2706	
  2707	âPrince VasÃ­li arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on
  2708	some inspection business,â remarked the visitor.
  2709	
  2710	âYes, but between ourselves,â said the princess, âthat is a
  2711	pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich,
  2712	hearing how ill he is.â
  2713	
  2714	âBut do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,â said the count;
  2715	and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the
  2716	young ladies. âI can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman
  2717	cut!â
  2718	
  2719	And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form
  2720	again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats
  2721	well and, in particular, drinks well. âSo do come and dine with us!â
  2722	he said.
  2723	
  2724	
  2725	
  2726	
  2727	
  2728	CHAPTER XI
  2729	
  2730	Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,
  2731	but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they
  2732	now rose and took their leave. The visitorâs daughter was already
  2733	smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when
  2734	suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls
  2735	running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl
  2736	of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock,
  2737	darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident
  2738	that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in
  2739	the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer
  2740	of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short
  2741	jacket.
  2742	
  2743	The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide
  2744	and threw them round the little girl who had run in.
  2745	
  2746	âAh, here she is!â he exclaimed laughing. âMy pet, whose name day
  2747	it is. My dear pet!â
  2748	
  2749	âMa chÃ¨re, there is a time for everything,â said the countess with
  2750	feigned severity. âYou spoil her, IlyÃ¡,â she added, turning to her
  2751	husband.
  2752	
  2753	âHow do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name
  2754	day,â said the visitor. âWhat a charming child,â she added,
  2755	addressing the mother.
  2756	
  2757	This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of lifeâwith
  2758	childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her
  2759	bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs
  2760	in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippersâwas just at that
  2761	charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not
  2762	yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed
  2763	face in the lace of her motherâs mantillaânot paying the least
  2764	attention to her severe remarkâand began to laugh. She laughed, and in
  2765	fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced
  2766	from the folds of her frock.
  2767	
  2768	âDo you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...â was all NatÃ¡sha
  2769	managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against
  2770	her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even
  2771	the prim visitor could not help joining in.
  2772	
  2773	âNow then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,â said the
  2774	mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning
  2775	to the visitor she added: âShe is my youngest girl.â
  2776	
  2777	NatÃ¡sha, raising her face for a moment from her motherâs mantilla,
  2778	glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.
  2779	
  2780	The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it
  2781	necessary to take some part in it.
  2782	
  2783	âTell me, my dear,â said she to NatÃ¡sha, âis Mimi a relation of
  2784	yours? A daughter, I suppose?â
  2785	
  2786	NatÃ¡sha did not like the visitorâs tone of condescension to childish
  2787	things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.
  2788	
  2789	Meanwhile the younger generation: BorÃ­s, the officer, Anna
  2790	MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the countâs eldest
  2791	son; SÃ³nya, the countâs fifteen-year-old niece, and little PÃ©tya,
  2792	his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were
  2793	obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement
  2794	and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms,
  2795	from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had
  2796	been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the
  2797	weather, and Countess AprÃ¡ksina. Now and then they glanced at one
  2798	another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.
  2799	
  2800	The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,
  2801	were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. BorÃ­s
  2802	was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate
  2803	features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.
  2804	Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face
  2805	expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered
  2806	the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but
  2807	failed. BorÃ­s on the contrary at once found his footing, and related
  2808	quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was
  2809	still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged
  2810	during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked
  2811	right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at NatÃ¡sha.
  2812	She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was
  2813	screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable
  2814	to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as
  2815	fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. BorÃ­s did not laugh.
  2816	
  2817	âYou were meaning to go out, werenât you, Mamma? Do you want the
  2818	carriage?â he asked his mother with a smile.
  2819	
  2820	âYes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,â she answered,
  2821	returning his smile.
  2822	
  2823	BorÃ­s quietly left the room and went in search of NatÃ¡sha. The plump
  2824	boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been
  2825	disturbed.
  2826	
  2827	
  2828	
  2829	
  2830	
  2831	CHAPTER XII
  2832	
  2833	The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the
  2834	young lady visitor and the countessâ eldest daughter (who was four
  2835	years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person),
  2836	were Nicholas and SÃ³nya, the niece. SÃ³nya was a slender little
  2837	brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long
  2838	lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny
  2839	tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but
  2840	graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements,
  2841	by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain
  2842	coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown
  2843	kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently
  2844	considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by
  2845	smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes
  2846	watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate
  2847	girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose
  2848	upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to
  2849	spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as
  2850	they too could, like NatÃ¡sha and BorÃ­s, escape from the drawing room.
  2851	
  2852	âAh yes, my dear,â said the count, addressing the visitor and
  2853	pointing to Nicholas, âhis friend BorÃ­s has become an officer, and
  2854	so for friendshipâs sake he is leaving the university and me, his
  2855	old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a
  2856	place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isnât
  2857	that friendship?â remarked the count in an inquiring tone.
  2858	
  2859	âBut they say that war has been declared,â replied the visitor.
  2860	
  2861	âTheyâve been saying so a long while,â said the count, âand
  2862	theyâll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My
  2863	dear, thereâs friendship for you,â he repeated. âHeâs joining
  2864	the hussars.â
  2865	
  2866	The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.
  2867	
  2868	âItâs not at all from friendship,â declared Nicholas, flaring
  2869	up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. âIt is not from
  2870	friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.â
  2871	
  2872	He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both
  2873	regarding him with a smile of approbation.
  2874	
  2875	âSchubert, the colonel of the PÃ¡vlograd Hussars, is dining with us
  2876	today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.
  2877	It canât be helped!â said the count, shrugging his shoulders and
  2878	speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.
  2879	
  2880	âI have already told you, Papa,â said his son, âthat if you
  2881	donât wish to let me go, Iâll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere
  2882	except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.âI
  2883	donât know how to hide what I feel.â As he spoke he kept glancing
  2884	with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at SÃ³nya and the young
  2885	lady visitor.
  2886	
  2887	The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment
  2888	to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.
  2889	
  2890	âAll right, all right!â said the old count. âHe always flares up!
  2891	This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he
  2892	rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,â he
  2893	added, not noticing his visitorâs sarcastic smile.
  2894	
  2895	The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie KarÃ¡gina turned to
  2896	young RostÃ³v.
  2897	
  2898	âWhat a pity you werenât at the ArkhÃ¡rovsâ on Thursday. It was so
  2899	dull without you,â said she, giving him a tender smile.
  2900	
  2901	The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
  2902	smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation
  2903	without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart
  2904	of SÃ³nya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk
  2905	he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and
  2906	hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile
  2907	on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholasâ animation
  2908	vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then
  2909	with a distressed face left the room to find SÃ³nya.
  2910	
  2911	âHow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their
  2912	sleeves!â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.
  2913	âCousinageâdangereux voisinage,â * she added.
  2914	
  2915	     * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.
  2916	
  2917	âYes,â said the countess when the brightness these young people had
  2918	brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no
  2919	one had put but which was always in her mind, âand how much suffering,
  2920	how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in
  2921	them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is
  2922	always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both
  2923	for girls and boys.â
  2924	
  2925	âIt all depends on the bringing up,â remarked the visitor.
  2926	
  2927	âYes, youâre quite right,â continued the countess. âTill now I
  2928	have always, thank God, been my childrenâs friend and had their full
  2929	confidence,â said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who
  2930	imagine that their children have no secrets from them. âI know I shall
  2931	always be my daughtersâ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with
  2932	his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy canât help it), he
  2933	will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.â
  2934	
  2935	âYes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,â chimed in the count,
  2936	who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding
  2937	that everything was splendid. âJust fancy: wants to be an hussar.
  2938	Whatâs one to do, my dear?â
  2939	
  2940	âWhat a charming creature your younger girl is,â said the visitor;
  2941	âa little volcano!â
  2942	
  2943	âYes, a regular volcano,â said the count. âTakes after me! And
  2944	what a voice she has; though sheâs my daughter, I tell the truth
  2945	when I say sheâll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an
  2946	Italian to give her lessons.â
  2947	
  2948	âIsnât she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train
  2949	it at that age.â
  2950	
  2951	âOh no, not at all too young!â replied the count. âWhy, our
  2952	mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.â
  2953	
  2954	âAnd sheâs in love with BorÃ­s already. Just fancy!â said the
  2955	countess with a gentle smile, looking at BorÃ­s and went on, evidently
  2956	concerned with a thought that always occupied her: âNow you see if I
  2957	were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they
  2958	might be up to on the slyâ (she meant that they would be kissing),
  2959	âbut as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to
  2960	me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I
  2961	spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I
  2962	was stricter.â
  2963	
  2964	âYes, I was brought up quite differently,â remarked the handsome
  2965	elder daughter, Countess VÃ©ra, with a smile.
  2966	
  2967	But the smile did not enhance VÃ©raâs beauty as smiles generally do;
  2968	on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,
  2969	expression. VÃ©ra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at
  2970	learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said
  2971	was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyoneâthe visitors
  2972	and countess alikeâturned to look at her as if wondering why she had
  2973	said it, and they all felt awkward.
  2974	
  2975	âPeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try to
  2976	make something exceptional of them,â said the visitor.
  2977	
  2978	âWhatâs the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too
  2979	clever with VÃ©ra,â said the count. âWell, what of that? Sheâs
  2980	turned out splendidly all the same,â he added, winking at VÃ©ra.
  2981	
  2982	The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.
  2983	
  2984	âWhat manners! I thought they would never go,â said the countess,
  2985	when she had seen her guests out.
  2986	
  2987	
  2988	
  2989	
  2990	
  2991	CHAPTER XIII
  2992	
  2993	When NatÃ¡sha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the
  2994	conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation
  2995	in the drawing room, waiting for BorÃ­s to come out. She was already
  2996	growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming
  2997	at once, when she heard the young manâs discreet steps approaching
  2998	neither quickly nor slowly. At this NatÃ¡sha dashed swiftly among the
  2999	flower tubs and hid there.
  3000	
  3001	BorÃ­s paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little
  3002	dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined
  3003	his handsome face. NatÃ¡sha, very still, peered out from her ambush,
  3004	waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the
  3005	glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. NatÃ¡sha was about to
  3006	call him but changed her mind. âLet him look for me,â thought she.
  3007	Hardly had BorÃ­s gone than SÃ³nya, flushed, in tears, and muttering
  3008	angrily, came in at the other door. NatÃ¡sha checked her first impulse
  3009	to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watchingâas
  3010	under an invisible capâto see what went on in the world. She was
  3011	experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. SÃ³nya, muttering to herself,
  3012	kept looking round toward the drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas
  3013	came in.
  3014	
  3015	âSÃ³nya, what is the matter with you? How can you?â said he, running
  3016	up to her.
  3017	
  3018	âItâs nothing, nothing; leave me alone!â sobbed SÃ³nya.
  3019	
  3020	âAh, I know what it is.â
  3021	
  3022	âWell, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!â
  3023	
  3024	âSÃ³-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that,
  3025	for a mere fancy?â said Nicholas taking her hand.
  3026	
  3027	SÃ³nya did not pull it away, and left off crying. NatÃ¡sha, not stirring
  3028	and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes.
  3029	âWhat will happen now?â thought she.
  3030	
  3031	âSÃ³nya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are
  3032	everything!â said Nicholas. âAnd I will prove it to you.â
  3033	
  3034	âI donât like you to talk like that.â
  3035	
  3036	âWell, then, I wonât; only forgive me, SÃ³nya!â He drew her to him
  3037	and kissed her.
  3038	
  3039	âOh, how nice,â thought NatÃ¡sha; and when SÃ³nya and Nicholas had
  3040	gone out of the conservatory she followed and called BorÃ­s to her.
  3041	
  3042	âBorÃ­s, come here,â said she with a sly and significant look. âI
  3043	have something to tell you. Here, here!â and she led him into the
  3044	conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.
  3045	
  3046	BorÃ­s followed her, smiling.
  3047	
  3048	âWhat is the something?â asked he.
  3049	
  3050	She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown
  3051	down on one of the tubs, picked it up.
  3052	
  3053	âKiss the doll,â said she.
  3054	
  3055	BorÃ­s looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not
  3056	reply.
  3057	
  3058	âDonât you want to? Well, then, come here,â said she, and
  3059	went further in among the plants and threw down the doll. âCloser,
  3060	closer!â she whispered.
  3061	
  3062	She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and
  3063	fear appeared on her flushed face.
  3064	
  3065	âAnd me? Would you like to kiss me?â she whispered almost inaudibly,
  3066	glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from
  3067	excitement.
  3068	
  3069	BorÃ­s blushed.
  3070	
  3071	âHow funny you are!â he said, bending down to her and blushing still
  3072	more, but he waited and did nothing.
  3073	
  3074	Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so
  3075	that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing
  3076	back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.
  3077	
  3078	Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs
  3079	and stood, hanging her head.
  3080	
  3081	âNatÃ¡sha,â he said, âyou know that I love you, but....â
  3082	
  3083	âYou are in love with me?â NatÃ¡sha broke in.
  3084	
  3085	âYes, I am, but please donât let us do like that.... In another four
  3086	years ... then I will ask for your hand.â
  3087	
  3088	NatÃ¡sha considered.
  3089	
  3090	âThirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,â she counted on her slender
  3091	little fingers. âAll right! Then itâs settled?â
  3092	
  3093	A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.
  3094	
  3095	âSettled!â replied BorÃ­s.
  3096	
  3097	âForever?â said the little girl. âTill death itself?â
  3098	
  3099	She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
  3100	sitting room.
  3101	
  3102	
  3103	
  3104	
  3105	
  3106	CHAPTER XIV
  3107	
  3108	After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave
  3109	orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to
  3110	dinner all who came âto congratulate.â The countess wished to have
  3111	a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna
  3112	MikhÃ¡ylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
  3113	Petersburg. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face,
  3114	drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.
  3115	
  3116	âWith you I will be quite frank,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âThere
  3117	are not many left of us old friends! Thatâs why I so value your
  3118	friendship.â
  3119	
  3120	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna looked at VÃ©ra and paused. The countess pressed her
  3121	friendâs hand.
  3122	
  3123	âVÃ©ra,â she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
  3124	favorite, âhow is it you have so little tact? Donât you see you are
  3125	not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...â
  3126	
  3127	The handsome VÃ©ra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.
  3128	
  3129	âIf you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,â she replied
  3130	as she rose to go to her own room.
  3131	
  3132	But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting,
  3133	one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. SÃ³nya was
  3134	sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the
  3135	first he had ever written. BorÃ­s and NatÃ¡sha were at the other window
  3136	and ceased talking when VÃ©ra entered. SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha looked at
  3137	VÃ©ra with guilty, happy faces.
  3138	
  3139	It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but
  3140	apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in VÃ©ra.
  3141	
  3142	âHow often have I asked you not to take my things?â she said. âYou
  3143	have a room of your own,â and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.
  3144	
  3145	âIn a minute, in a minute,â he said, dipping his pen.
  3146	
  3147	âYou always manage to do things at the wrong time,â continued VÃ©ra.
  3148	âYou came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed
  3149	of you.â
  3150	
  3151	Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one
  3152	replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the
  3153	room with the inkstand in her hand.
  3154	
  3155	âAnd at your age what secrets can there be between NatÃ¡sha and
  3156	BorÃ­s, or between you two? Itâs all nonsense!â
  3157	
  3158	âNow, VÃ©ra, what does it matter to you?â said NatÃ¡sha in defense,
  3159	speaking very gently.
  3160	
  3161	She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
  3162	everyone.
  3163	
  3164	âVery silly,â said VÃ©ra. âI am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!â
  3165	
  3166	âAll have secrets of their own,â answered NatÃ¡sha, getting warmer.
  3167	âWe donât interfere with you and Berg.â
  3168	
  3169	âI should think not,â said VÃ©ra, âbecause there can never be
  3170	anything wrong in my behavior. But Iâll just tell Mamma how you are
  3171	behaving with BorÃ­s.â
  3172	
  3173	âNatÃ¡lya IlynÃ­chna behaves very well to me,â remarked BorÃ­s. âI
  3174	have nothing to complain of.â
  3175	
  3176	âDonât, BorÃ­s! You are such a diplomat that it is really
  3177	tiresome,â said NatÃ¡sha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.
  3178	(She used the word âdiplomat,â which was just then much in vogue
  3179	among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) âWhy
  3180	does she bother me?â And she added, turning to VÃ©ra, âYouâll
  3181	never understand it, because youâve never loved anyone. You have no
  3182	heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing moreâ (this nickname,
  3183	bestowed on VÃ©ra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), âand
  3184	your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with
  3185	Berg as much as you please,â she finished quickly.
  3186	
  3187	âI shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...â
  3188	
  3189	âWell, now youâve done what you wanted,â put in Nicholasââsaid
  3190	unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Letâs go to the
  3191	nursery.â
  3192	
  3193	All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.
  3194	
  3195	âThe unpleasant things were said to me,â remarked VÃ©ra, âI said
  3196	none to anyone.â
  3197	
  3198	âMadame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!â shouted laughing voices
  3199	through the door.
  3200	
  3201	The handsome VÃ©ra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant
  3202	effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been
  3203	said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf.
  3204	Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and
  3205	calmer.
  3206	
  3207	
  3208	In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.
  3209	
  3210	âAh, my dear,â said the countess, âmy life is not all roses
  3211	either. Donât I know that at the rate we are living our means wonât
  3212	last long? Itâs all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the
  3213	country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what
  3214	besides! But donât letâs talk about me; tell me how you managed
  3215	everything. I often wonder at you, Annetteâhow at your age you
  3216	can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those
  3217	ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! Itâs
  3218	quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldnât possibly
  3219	do it.â
  3220	
  3221	âAh, my love,â answered Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, âGod grant you never
  3222	know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love
  3223	to distraction! One learns many things then,â she added with a certain
  3224	pride. âThat lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those
  3225	big people I write a note: âPrincess So-and-So desires an interview
  3226	with So and-So,â and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or
  3227	four timesâtill I get what I want. I donât mind what they think of
  3228	me.â
  3229	
  3230	âWell, and to whom did you apply about BÃ³ry?â asked the countess.
  3231	âYou see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas
  3232	is going as a cadet. Thereâs no one to interest himself for him. To
  3233	whom did you apply?â
  3234	
  3235	âTo Prince VasÃ­li. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything,
  3236	and put the matter before the Emperor,â said Princess Anna
  3237	MikhÃ¡ylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she
  3238	had endured to gain her end.
  3239	
  3240	âHas Prince VasÃ­li aged much?â asked the countess. âI have not
  3241	seen him since we acted together at the RumyÃ¡ntsovsâ theatricals. I
  3242	expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,â said
  3243	the countess, with a smile.
  3244	
  3245	âHe is just the same as ever,â replied Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,
  3246	âoverflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head
  3247	at all. He said to me, âI am sorry I can do so little for you, dear
  3248	Princess. I am at your command.â Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very
  3249	kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do
  3250	anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my
  3251	position is now a terrible one,â continued Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, sadly,
  3252	dropping her voice. âMy wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no
  3253	progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and donât
  3254	know how to equip BorÃ­s.â She took out her handkerchief and began to
  3255	cry. âI need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble
  3256	note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril
  3257	VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhov. If he will not assist his godsonâyou know
  3258	he is BÃ³ryâs godfatherâand allow him something for his maintenance,
  3259	all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to
  3260	equip him.â
  3261	
  3262	The countessâ eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.
  3263	
  3264	âI often think, though, perhaps itâs a sin,â said the princess,
  3265	âthat here lives Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhov so rich, all
  3266	alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? Itâs a
  3267	burden to him, and BÃ³ryâs life is only just beginning....â
  3268	
  3269	âSurely he will leave something to BorÃ­s,â said the countess.
  3270	
  3271	âHeaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.
  3272	Still, I will take BorÃ­s and go to see him at once, and I shall speak
  3273	to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, itâs
  3274	really all the same to me when my sonâs fate is at stake.â The
  3275	princess rose. âItâs now two oâclock and you dine at four. There
  3276	will just be time.â
  3277	
  3278	And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of
  3279	time, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the
  3280	anteroom with him.
  3281	
  3282	âGood-by, my dear,â said she to the countess who saw her to the
  3283	door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, âWish me
  3284	good luck.â
  3285	
  3286	âAre you going to Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich, my dear?â said the
  3287	count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:
  3288	âIf he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the
  3289	house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my
  3290	dear. We will see how TarÃ¡s distinguishes himself today. He says Count
  3291	OrlÃ³v never gave such a dinner as ours will be!â
  3292	
  3293	
  3294	
  3295	
  3296	
  3297	CHAPTER XV
  3298	
  3299	âMy dear BorÃ­s,â said Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna to her son as
  3300	Countess RostÃ³vaâs carriage in which they were seated drove over the
  3301	straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril
  3302	VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhovâs house. âMy dear BorÃ­s,â said the
  3303	mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying
  3304	it timidly and tenderly on her sonâs arm, âbe affectionate and
  3305	attentive to him. Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich is your godfather after
  3306	all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice
  3307	to him, as you so well know how to be.â
  3308	
  3309	âIf only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of
  3310	it...â answered her son coldly. âBut I have promised and will do it
  3311	for your sake.â
  3312	
  3313	Although the hall porter saw someoneâs carriage standing at the
  3314	entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to
  3315	be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
  3316	rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the ladyâs old
  3317	cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and,
  3318	hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse
  3319	today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.
  3320	
  3321	âWe may as well go back,â said the son in French.
  3322	
  3323	âMy dear!â exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand
  3324	on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.
  3325	
  3326	BorÃ­s said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking
  3327	off his cloak.
  3328	
  3329	âMy friend,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna in gentle tones, addressing
  3330	the hall porter, âI know Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich is very ill...
  3331	thatâs why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him,
  3332	my friend... I only need see Prince VasÃ­li SergÃ©evich: he is staying
  3333	here, is he not? Please announce me.â
  3334	
  3335	The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned
  3336	away.
  3337	
  3338	âPrincess DrubetskÃ¡ya to see Prince VasÃ­li SergÃ©evich,â he called
  3339	to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,
  3340	who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.
  3341	
  3342	The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large
  3343	Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly
  3344	ascended the carpeted stairs.
  3345	
  3346	âMy dear,â she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a
  3347	touch, âyou promised me!â
  3348	
  3349	The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.
  3350	
  3351	They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the
  3352	apartments assigned to Prince VasÃ­li.
  3353	
  3354	Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were
  3355	about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
  3356	entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince VasÃ­li
  3357	came outâwearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast,
  3358	as was his custom when at homeâtaking leave of a good-looking,
  3359	dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.
  3360	
  3361	âThen it is certain?â said the prince.
  3362	
  3363	âPrince, humanum est errare, * but...â replied the doctor,
  3364	swallowing his râs, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French
  3365	accent.
  3366	
  3367	     * To err is human.
  3368	
  3369	âVery well, very well...â
  3370	
  3371	Seeing Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna and her son, Prince VasÃ­li dismissed the
  3372	doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of
  3373	inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly
  3374	clouded his motherâs face, and he smiled slightly.
  3375	
  3376	âAh, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our
  3377	dear invalid?â said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look
  3378	fixed on her.
  3379	
  3380	Prince VasÃ­li stared at her and at BorÃ­s questioningly and perplexed.
  3381	BorÃ­s bowed politely. Prince VasÃ­li without acknowledging the bow
  3382	turned to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, answering her query by a movement of the
  3383	head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.
  3384	
  3385	âIs it possible?â exclaimed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âOh, how awful!
  3386	It is terrible to think.... This is my son,â she added, indicating
  3387	BorÃ­s. âHe wanted to thank you himself.â
  3388	
  3389	BorÃ­s bowed again politely.
  3390	
  3391	âBelieve me, Prince, a motherâs heart will never forget what you
  3392	have done for us.â
  3393	
  3394	âI am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna
  3395	MikhÃ¡ylovna,â said Prince VasÃ­li, arranging his lace frill, and in
  3396	tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna whom he had placed
  3397	under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he
  3398	had done in Petersburg at Anna SchÃ©rerâs reception.
  3399	
  3400	âTry to serve well and show yourself worthy,â added he, addressing
  3401	BorÃ­s with severity. âI am glad.... Are you here on leave?â he went
  3402	on in his usual tone of indifference.
  3403	
  3404	âI am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,â
  3405	replied BorÃ­s, betraying neither annoyance at the princeâs brusque
  3406	manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly
  3407	and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.
  3408	
  3409	âAre you living with your mother?â
  3410	
  3411	âI am living at Countess RostÃ³vaâs,â replied BorÃ­s, again
  3412	adding, âyour excellency.â
  3413	
  3414	âThat is, with IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v who married Nataly ShinshinÃ¡,â said
  3415	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna.
  3416	
  3417	âI know, I know,â answered Prince VasÃ­li in his monotonous voice.
  3418	âI never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that
  3419	unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too,
  3420	I am told.â
  3421	
  3422	âBut a very kind man, Prince,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with a
  3423	pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count RostÃ³v deserved this
  3424	censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. âWhat
  3425	do the doctors say?â asked the princess after a pause, her worn face
  3426	again expressing deep sorrow.
  3427	
  3428	âThey give little hope,â replied the prince.
  3429	
  3430	âAnd I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me
  3431	and BorÃ­s. He is his godson,â she added, her tone suggesting that
  3432	this fact ought to give Prince VasÃ­li much satisfaction.
  3433	
  3434	Prince VasÃ­li became thoughtful and frowned. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna saw that
  3435	he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count BezÃºkhovâs fortune,
  3436	and hastened to reassure him.
  3437	
  3438	âIf it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,â
  3439	said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, âI
  3440	know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with
  3441	him except the young princesses.... They are still young....â She bent
  3442	her head and continued in a whisper: âHas he performed his final duty,
  3443	Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no
  3444	worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill.
  3445	We women, Prince,â and she smiled tenderly, âalways know how to say
  3446	these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for
  3447	me. I am used to suffering.â
  3448	
  3449	Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done
  3450	at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna
  3451	MikhÃ¡ylovna.
  3452	
  3453	âWould not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna
  3454	MikhÃ¡ylovna?â said he. âLet us wait until evening. The doctors are
  3455	expecting a crisis.â
  3456	
  3457	âBut one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the
  3458	welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a
  3459	Christian...â
  3460	
  3461	A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the
  3462	countâs niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her
  3463	body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince VasÃ­li
  3464	turned to her.
  3465	
  3466	âWell, how is he?â
  3467	
  3468	âStill the same; but what can you expect, this noise...â said the
  3469	princess, looking at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna as at a stranger.
  3470	
  3471	âAh, my dear, I hardly knew you,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with a
  3472	happy smile, ambling lightly up to the countâs niece. âI have come,
  3473	and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you
  3474	have gone through,â and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.
  3475	
  3476	The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as
  3477	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she
  3478	had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince VasÃ­li to
  3479	take a seat beside her.
  3480	
  3481	âBorÃ­s,â she said to her son with a smile, âI shall go in to see
  3482	the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile
  3483	and donât forget to give him the RostÃ³vsâ invitation. They ask him
  3484	to dinner. I suppose he wonât go?â she continued, turning to the
  3485	prince.
  3486	
  3487	âOn the contrary,â replied the prince, who had plainly become
  3488	depressed, âI shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young
  3489	man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.â
  3490	
  3491	He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted BorÃ­s down one flight of
  3492	stairs and up another, to Pierreâs rooms.
  3493	
  3494	
  3495	
  3496	
  3497	
  3498	CHAPTER XVI
  3499	
  3500	Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in
  3501	Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
  3502	sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count RostÃ³vâs was true.
  3503	Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been
  3504	for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his fatherâs
  3505	house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be
  3506	already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his fatherâwho were
  3507	never favorably disposed toward himâwould have used it to turn the
  3508	count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to
  3509	his fatherâs part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the
  3510	princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom
  3511	were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the
  3512	eldest who was readingâthe one who had met Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. The
  3513	two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they
  3514	differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her
  3515	much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper.
  3516	The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him
  3517	with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression;
  3518	while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and
  3519	lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked
  3520	by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the
  3521	canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying
  3522	to make out the pattern.
  3523	
  3524	âHow do you do, cousin?â said Pierre. âYou donât recognize
  3525	me?â
  3526	
  3527	âI recognize you only too well, too well.â
  3528	
  3529	âHow is the count? Can I see him?â asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,
  3530	but unabashed.
  3531	
  3532	âThe count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you
  3533	have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.â
  3534	
  3535	âCan I see the count?â Pierre again asked.
  3536	
  3537	âHm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see
  3538	him... Olga, go and see whether Uncleâs beef tea is readyâit is
  3539	almost time,â she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were
  3540	busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,
  3541	Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.
  3542	
  3543	Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and
  3544	said: âThen I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see
  3545	him.â
  3546	
  3547	And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the
  3548	sister with the mole.
  3549	
  3550	Next day Prince VasÃ­li had arrived and settled in the countâs house.
  3551	He sent for Pierre and said to him: âMy dear fellow, if you are going
  3552	to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that
  3553	is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must
  3554	not see him at all.â
  3555	
  3556	Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in
  3557	his rooms upstairs.
  3558	
  3559	When BorÃ­s appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,
  3560	stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,
  3561	as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely
  3562	over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering
  3563	indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.
  3564	
  3565	âEngland is done for,â said he, scowling and pointing his finger
  3566	at someone unseen. âMr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the
  3567	rights of man, is sentenced to...â But before Pierreâwho at that
  3568	moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just
  3569	effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured
  3570	Londonâcould pronounce Pittâs sentence, he saw a well-built and
  3571	handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left
  3572	Moscow when BorÃ­s was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him,
  3573	but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took BorÃ­s by the hand
  3574	with a friendly smile.
  3575	
  3576	âDo you remember me?â asked BorÃ­s quietly with a pleasant smile.
  3577	âI have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not
  3578	well.â
  3579	
  3580	âYes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,â
  3581	answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.
  3582	
  3583	BorÃ­s felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider
  3584	it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least
  3585	embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.
  3586	
  3587	âCount RostÃ³v asks you to come to dinner today,â said he, after a
  3588	considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.
  3589	
  3590	âAh, Count RostÃ³v!â exclaimed Pierre joyfully. âThen you are his
  3591	son, IlyÃ¡? Only fancy, I didnât know you at first. Do you remember
  3592	how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... Itâs such an
  3593	age...â
  3594	
  3595	âYou are mistaken,â said BorÃ­s deliberately, with a bold and
  3596	slightly sarcastic smile. âI am BorÃ­s, son of Princess Anna
  3597	MikhÃ¡ylovna DrubetskÃ¡ya. RostÃ³v, the father, is IlyÃ¡, and his son is
  3598	Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.â
  3599	
  3600	Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.
  3601	
  3602	âOh dear, what am I thinking about? Iâve mixed everything up. One
  3603	has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are BorÃ­s? Of course. Well, now
  3604	we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?
  3605	The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the
  3606	Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve
  3607	doesnât make a mess of things!â
  3608	
  3609	BorÃ­s knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the
  3610	papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuveâs name.
  3611	
  3612	âWe here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
  3613	than with politics,â said he in his quiet ironical tone. âI know
  3614	nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy
  3615	with gossip,â he continued. âJust now they are talking about you and
  3616	your father.â
  3617	
  3618	Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companionâs
  3619	sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.
  3620	But BorÃ­s spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into
  3621	Pierreâs eyes.
  3622	
  3623	âMoscow has nothing else to do but gossip,â BorÃ­s went on.
  3624	âEverybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,
  3625	though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...â
  3626	
  3627	âYes, it is all very horrid,â interrupted Pierre, âvery horrid.â
  3628	
  3629	Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
  3630	something disconcerting to himself.
  3631	
  3632	âAnd it must seem to you,â said BorÃ­s flushing slightly, but not
  3633	changing his tone or attitude, âit must seem to you that everyone is
  3634	trying to get something out of the rich man?â
  3635	
  3636	âSo it does,â thought Pierre.
  3637	
  3638	âBut I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are
  3639	quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are
  3640	very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that
  3641	your father is rich, I donât regard myself as a relation of his, and
  3642	neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.â
  3643	
  3644	For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped
  3645	up from the sofa, seized BorÃ­s under the elbow in his quick, clumsy
  3646	way, and, blushing far more than BorÃ­s, began to speak with a feeling
  3647	of mingled shame and vexation.
  3648	
  3649	âWell, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know
  3650	very well...â
  3651	
  3652	But BorÃ­s again interrupted him.
  3653	
  3654	âI am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You
  3655	must excuse me,â said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put
  3656	at ease by him, âbut I hope I have not offended you. I always make it
  3657	a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to
  3658	dinner at the RostÃ³vsâ?â
  3659	
  3660	And BorÃ­s, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
  3661	extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,
  3662	became quite pleasant again.
  3663	
  3664	âNo, but I say,â said Pierre, calming down, âyou are a wonderful
  3665	fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you
  3666	donât know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we
  3667	were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand.
  3668	I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but
  3669	itâs splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. Itâs
  3670	queer,â he added after a pause, âthat you should have suspected
  3671	me!â He began to laugh. âWell, what of it! I hope weâll get better
  3672	acquainted,â and he pressed BorÃ­sâ hand. âDo you know, I have not
  3673	once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for
  3674	him as a man, but what can one do?â
  3675	
  3676	âAnd so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?â asked
  3677	BorÃ­s with a smile.
  3678	
  3679	Pierre saw that BorÃ­s wished to change the subject, and being of the
  3680	same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
  3681	Boulogne expedition.
  3682	
  3683	A footman came in to summon BorÃ­sâthe princess was going. Pierre, in
  3684	order to make BorÃ­sâ better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner,
  3685	and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
  3686	into BorÃ­sâ eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and
  3687	down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with
  3688	his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant,
  3689	intelligent, and resolute young man.
  3690	
  3691	As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely
  3692	life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up
  3693	his mind that they would be friends.
  3694	
  3695	Prince VasÃ­li saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes
  3696	and her face was tearful.
  3697	
  3698	âIt is dreadful, dreadful!â she was saying, âbut cost me what it
  3699	may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be
  3700	left like this. Every moment is precious. I canât think why his nieces
  3701	put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!...
  3702	Adieu, Prince! May God support you...â
  3703	
  3704	âAdieu, ma bonne,â answered Prince VasÃ­li turning away from her.
  3705	
  3706	âOh, he is in a dreadful state,â said the mother to her son when
  3707	they were in the carriage. âHe hardly recognizes anybody.â
  3708	
  3709	âI donât understand, Mammaâwhat is his attitude to Pierre?â
  3710	asked the son.
  3711	
  3712	âThe will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.â
  3713	
  3714	âBut why do you expect that he will leave us anything?â
  3715	
  3716	âAh, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!â
  3717	
  3718	âWell, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...â
  3719	
  3720	âOh, Heaven! How ill he is!â exclaimed the mother.
  3721	
  3722

  3726	CHAPTER XVII
  3727	
  3728	After Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril
  3729	VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhov, Countess RostÃ³va sat for a long time all
  3730	alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.
  3731	
  3732	âWhat is the matter with you, my dear?â she said crossly to the maid
  3733	who kept her waiting some minutes. âDonât you wish to serve me? Then
  3734	Iâll find you another place.â
  3735	
  3736	The countess was upset by her friendâs sorrow and humiliating poverty,
  3737	and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always
  3738	found expression in calling her maid âmy dearâ and speaking to her
  3739	with exaggerated politeness.
  3740	
  3741	âI am very sorry, maâam,â answered the maid.
  3742	
  3743	âAsk the count to come to me.â
  3744	
  3745	The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as
  3746	usual.
  3747	
  3748	âWell, little countess? What a sautÃ© of game au madÃ¨re we are to
  3749	have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for TarÃ¡s were
  3750	not ill-spent. He is worth it!â
  3751	
  3752	He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling
  3753	his gray hair.
  3754	
  3755	âWhat are your commands, little countess?â
  3756	
  3757	âYou see, my dear... Whatâs that mess?â she said, pointing to his
  3758	waistcoat. âItâs the sautÃ©, most likely,â she added with a smile.
  3759	âWell, you see, Count, I want some money.â
  3760	
  3761	Her face became sad.
  3762	
  3763	âOh, little countess!â ... and the count began bustling to get out
  3764	his pocketbook.
  3765	
  3766	âI want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,â and taking
  3767	out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husbandâs waistcoat.
  3768	
  3769	âYes, immediately, immediately! Hey, whoâs there?â he called out
  3770	in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will
  3771	rush to obey the summons. âSend DmÃ­tri to me!â
  3772	
  3773	DmÃ­tri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the countâs
  3774	house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.
  3775	
  3776	âThis is what I want, my dear fellow,â said the count to the
  3777	deferential young man who had entered. âBring me...â he reflected
  3778	a moment, âyes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, donât
  3779	bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones
  3780	for the countess.â
  3781	
  3782	âYes, DmÃ­tri, clean ones, please,â said the countess, sighing
  3783	deeply.
  3784	
  3785	âWhen would you like them, your excellency?â asked DmÃ­tri. âAllow
  3786	me to inform you... But, donât be uneasy,â he added, noticing that
  3787	the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always
  3788	a sign of approaching anger. âI was forgetting... Do you wish it
  3789	brought at once?â
  3790	
  3791	âYes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.â
  3792	
  3793	âWhat a treasure that DmÃ­tri is,â added the count with a smile when
  3794	the young man had departed. âThere is never any âimpossibleâ with
  3795	him. Thatâs a thing I hate! Everything is possible.â
  3796	
  3797	âAh, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,â
  3798	said the countess. âBut I am in great need of this sum.â
  3799	
  3800	âYou, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,â said the
  3801	count, and having kissed his wifeâs hand he went back to his study.
  3802	
  3803	When Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna returned from Count BezÃºkhovâs the money, all
  3804	in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countessâ
  3805	little table, and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna noticed that something was agitating
  3806	her.
  3807	
  3808	âWell, my dear?â asked the countess.
  3809	
  3810	âOh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so
  3811	ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...â
  3812	
  3813	âAnnette, for heavenâs sake donât refuse me,â the countess
  3814	began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,
  3815	elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.
  3816	
  3817	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be
  3818	ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.
  3819	
  3820	âThis is for BorÃ­s from me, for his outfit.â
  3821	
  3822	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess
  3823	wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were
  3824	kindhearted, and because theyâfriends from childhoodâhad to think
  3825	about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....
  3826	But those tears were pleasant to them both.
  3827	
  3828	
  3829	
  3830	
  3831	
  3832	CHAPTER XVIII
  3833	
  3834	Countess RostÃ³va, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was
  3835	already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into
  3836	his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From
  3837	time to time he went out to ask: âHasnât she come yet?â They
  3838	were expecting MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna AkhrosÃ­mova, known in society as le
  3839	terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for
  3840	common sense and frank plainness of speech. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna was known
  3841	to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both
  3842	cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told
  3843	good stories about her, while none the less all without exception
  3844	respected and feared her.
  3845	
  3846	In the countâs room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked
  3847	of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the
  3848	recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew
  3849	it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were
  3850	smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head
  3851	first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident
  3852	pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he
  3853	egged on against each other.
  3854	
  3855	One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
  3856	face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable
  3857	young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,
  3858	having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the
  3859	smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,
  3860	ShinshÃ­n, a cousin of the countessâ, a man with âa sharp tongueâ
  3861	as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to
  3862	his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards,
  3863	irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the
  3864	middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting
  3865	it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an
  3866	officer in the SemÃ«nov regiment with whom BorÃ­s was to travel to join
  3867	the army, and about whom NatÃ¡sha had teased her elder sister VÃ©ra,
  3868	speaking of Berg as her âintended.â The count sat between them and
  3869	listened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a
  3870	card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he
  3871	succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.
  3872	
  3873	âWell, then, old chap, mon trÃ¨s honorable Alphonse KÃ¡rlovich,â
  3874	said ShinshÃ­n, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian
  3875	expressions with the choicest French phrasesâwhich was a peculiarity
  3876	of his speech. âVous comptez vous faire des rentes sur lâÃ©tat; *
  3877	you want to make something out of your company?â
  3878	
  3879	     * You expect to make an income out of the government.
  3880	
  3881	âNo, Peter NikolÃ¡evich; I only want to show that in the cavalry
  3882	the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own
  3883	position now, Peter NikolÃ¡evich...â
  3884	
  3885	Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His
  3886	conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm
  3887	and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
  3888	on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put
  3889	out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as
  3890	soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
  3891	circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.
  3892	
  3893	âConsider my position, Peter NikolÃ¡evich. Were I in the cavalry I
  3894	should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even
  3895	with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and
  3896	thirty,â said he, looking at ShinshÃ­n and the count with a joyful,
  3897	pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must
  3898	always be the chief desire of everyone else.
  3899	
  3900	âBesides that, Peter NikolÃ¡evich, by exchanging into the Guards
  3901	I shall be in a more prominent position,â continued Berg, âand
  3902	vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think
  3903	what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to
  3904	put a little aside and to send something to my father,â he went on,
  3905	emitting a smoke ring.
  3906	
  3907	âLa balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the
  3908	proverb says,â remarked ShinshÃ­n, moving his pipe to the other side
  3909	of his mouth and winking at the count.
  3910	
  3911	      * So that squares matters.
  3912	
  3913	The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that ShinshÃ­n
  3914	was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,
  3915	continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already
  3916	gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime
  3917	the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company,
  3918	might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in
  3919	the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently
  3920	enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,
  3921	too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily
  3922	sedate, and the naÃ¯vetÃ© of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that
  3923	he disarmed his hearers.
  3924	
  3925	âWell, my boy, youâll get along wherever you goâfoot or
  3926	horseâthat Iâll warrant,â said ShinshÃ­n, patting him on the
  3927	shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.
  3928	
  3929	Berg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the
  3930	drawing room.
  3931	
  3932	It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,
  3933	expecting the summons to zakÃºska, * avoid engaging in any long
  3934	conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order
  3935	to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and
  3936	hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another,
  3937	and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are
  3938	waiting forâsome important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish
  3939	that is not yet ready.
  3940	
  3941	     * Hors dâoeuvres.
  3942	
  3943	Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the
  3944	middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across,
  3945	blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk,
  3946	but he went on naÃ¯vely looking around through his spectacles as if in
  3947	search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He
  3948	was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of
  3949	the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity
  3950	at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest
  3951	fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.
  3952	
  3953	âYou have only lately arrived?â the countess asked him.
  3954	
  3955	âOui, madame,â replied he, looking around him.
  3956	
  3957	âYou have not yet seen my husband?â
  3958	
  3959	âNon, madame.â He smiled quite inappropriately.
  3960	
  3961	âYou have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose itâs very
  3962	interesting.â
  3963	
  3964	âVery interesting.â
  3965	
  3966	The countess exchanged glances with Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. The latter
  3967	understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and
  3968	sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he
  3969	answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other
  3970	guests were all conversing with one another. âThe RazumÃ³vskis... It
  3971	was charming... You are very kind... Countess AprÃ¡ksina...â was heard
  3972	on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.
  3973	
  3974	âMÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna?â came her voice from there.
  3975	
  3976	âHerself,â came the answer in a rough voice, and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
  3977	entered the room.
  3978	
  3979	All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
  3980	oldest rose. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,
  3981	holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood
  3982	surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
  3983	rolling them up. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna always spoke in Russian.
  3984	
  3985	âHealth and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her
  3986	children,â she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all
  3987	others. âWell, you old sinner,â she went on, turning to the count
  3988	who was kissing her hand, âyouâre feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay?
  3989	Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just
  3990	see how these nestlings are growing up,â and she pointed to the girls.
  3991	âYou must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....â
  3992	
  3993	âWell,â said she, âhowâs my Cossack?â (MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
  3994	always called NatÃ¡sha a Cossack) and she stroked the childâs arm as
  3995	she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. âI know sheâs a scamp
  3996	of a girl, but I like her.â
  3997	
  3998	She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,
  3999	having given them to the rosy NatÃ¡sha, who beamed with the pleasure
  4000	of her saintâs-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to
  4001	Pierre.
  4002	
  4003	âEh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,â said she, assuming a soft high
  4004	tone of voice. âCome here, my friend...â and she ominously tucked
  4005	up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a
  4006	childlike way through his spectacles.
  4007	
  4008	âCome nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell
  4009	your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case itâs my
  4010	evident duty.â She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to
  4011	follow, for this was clearly only a prelude.
  4012	
  4013	âA fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed
  4014	and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,
  4015	sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.â
  4016	
  4017	She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep
  4018	from laughing.
  4019	
  4020	âWell, I suppose it is time we were at table?â said MÃ¡rya
  4021	DmÃ­trievna.
  4022	
  4023	The count went in first with MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, the countess followed
  4024	on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because
  4025	Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
  4026	with ShinshÃ­n. Berg gave his arm to VÃ©ra. The smiling Julie KarÃ¡gina
  4027	went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the
  4028	whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses
  4029	followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the
  4030	band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their
  4031	places. Then the strains of the countâs household band were replaced
  4032	by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the
  4033	soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with
  4034	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna on her right and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna on her left, the
  4035	other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count,
  4036	with the hussar colonel on his left and ShinshÃ­n and the other male
  4037	visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the
  4038	grown-up young people: VÃ©ra beside Berg, and Pierre beside BorÃ­s; and
  4039	on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind
  4040	the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his
  4041	wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled
  4042	his neighborsâ glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn,
  4043	without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from
  4044	behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed
  4045	by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the
  4046	ladiesâ end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the
  4047	menâs end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the
  4048	colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so
  4049	much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg
  4050	with tender smiles was saying to VÃ©ra that love is not an earthly but
  4051	a heavenly feeling. BorÃ­s was telling his new friend Pierre who the
  4052	guests were and exchanging glances with NatÃ¡sha, who was sitting
  4053	opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a
  4054	great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and
  4055	went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines.
  4056	These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a
  4057	napkin, from behind the next manâs shoulders and whispered: âDry
  4058	Madeiraâ... âHungarianâ... or âRhine wineâ as the case might
  4059	be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the countâs monogram
  4060	that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank
  4061	with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other
  4062	guests. NatÃ¡sha, who sat opposite, was looking at BorÃ­s as girls of
  4063	thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for
  4064	the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny
  4065	lively little girlâs look made him inclined to laugh without knowing
  4066	why.
  4067	
  4068	Nicholas sat at some distance from SÃ³nya, beside Julie KarÃ¡gina, to
  4069	whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. SÃ³nya wore
  4070	a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned
  4071	pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas
  4072	and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round
  4073	uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the
  4074	children. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines,
  4075	and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner
  4076	to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler
  4077	with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to
  4078	appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because
  4079	no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
  4080	greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for
  4081	knowledge.

  4086	
  4087	CHAPTER XIX
  4088	
  4089	At the menâs end of the table the talk grew more and more animated.
  4090	The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared
  4091	in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day
  4092	been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.
  4093	
  4094	âAnd why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?â remarked
  4095	ShinshÃ­n. âHe has stopped Austriaâs cackle and I fear it will be
  4096	our turn next.â
  4097	
  4098	The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to
  4099	the service and patriotically Russian. He resented ShinshÃ­nâs remark.
  4100	
  4101	âIt is for the reasson, my goot sir,â said he, speaking with a
  4102	German accent, âfor the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He
  4103	declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger
  4104	vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell
  4105	as ze sanctity of its alliances...â he spoke this last word with
  4106	particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.
  4107	
  4108	Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
  4109	repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:
  4110	
  4111	... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperorâs sole and absolute
  4112	aimâto establish peace in Europe on firm foundationsâhas now decided
  4113	him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition
  4114	for the attainment of that purpose.
  4115	
  4116	âZat, my dear sir, is vy...â he concluded, drinking a tumbler of
  4117	wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.
  4118	
  4119	âConnaissez-vous le Proverbe:* âJerome, Jerome, do not roam, but
  4120	turn spindles at home!â?â said ShinshÃ­n, puckering his brows and
  4121	smiling. âCela nous convient Ã  merveille.*(2) SuvÃ³rov nowâhe knew
  4122	what he was about; yet they beat him Ã  plate couture,*(3) and where
  4123	are we to find SuvÃ³rovs now? Je vous demande un peu,â *(4) said he,
  4124	continually changing from French to Russian.
  4125	
  4126	     *Do you know the proverb?
  4127	
  4128	     *(2) That suits us down to the ground.
  4129	
  4130	     *(3) Hollow.
  4131	
  4132	     *(4) I just ask you that.
  4133	
  4134	âVe must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!â said the colonel,
  4135	thumping the table; âand ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill
  4136	pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossibleâ... he dwelt
  4137	particularly on the word possible... âas po-o-ossible,â he ended,
  4138	again turning to the count. âZat is how ve old hussars look at it, and
  4139	zereâs an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar,
  4140	how do you judge of it?â he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he
  4141	heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with
  4142	eyes and ears intent on the colonel.
  4143	
  4144	âI am quite of your opinion,â replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning
  4145	his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision
  4146	and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great
  4147	danger. âI am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,â he
  4148	concluded, consciousâas were othersâafter the words were uttered
  4149	that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and
  4150	were therefore awkward.
  4151	
  4152	âWhat you said just now was splendid!â said his partner Julie.
  4153	
  4154	SÃ³nya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and
  4155	down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.
  4156	
  4157	Pierre listened to the colonelâs speech and nodded approvingly.
  4158	
  4159	âThatâs fine,â said he.
  4160	
  4161	âThe young manâs a real hussar!â shouted the colonel, again
  4162	thumping the table.
  4163	
  4164	âWhat are you making such a noise about over there?â MÃ¡rya
  4165	DmÃ­trievnaâs deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the
  4166	table. âWhat are you thumping the table for?â she demanded of the
  4167	hussar, âand why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French
  4168	are here?â
  4169	
  4170	âI am speaking ze truce,â replied the hussar with a smile.
  4171	
  4172	âItâs all about the war,â the count shouted down the table. âYou
  4173	know my sonâs going, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna? My son is going.â
  4174	
  4175	âI have four sons in the army but still I donât fret. It is all
  4176	in Godâs hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a
  4177	battle,â replied MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs deep voice, which easily
  4178	carried the whole length of the table.
  4179	
  4180	âThatâs true!â
  4181	
  4182	Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladiesâ at the one end
  4183	and the menâs at the other.
  4184	
  4185	âYou wonât ask,â NatÃ¡shaâs little brother was saying; âI know
  4186	you wonât ask!â
  4187	
  4188	âI will,â replied NatÃ¡sha.
  4189	
  4190	Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half
  4191	rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what
  4192	was coming, and turning to her mother:
  4193	
  4194	âMamma!â rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,
  4195	audible the whole length of the table.
  4196	
  4197	âWhat is it?â asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her
  4198	daughterâs face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her
  4199	sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.
  4200	
  4201	The conversation was hushed.
  4202	
  4203	âMamma! What sweets are we going to have?â and NatÃ¡shaâs voice
  4204	sounded still more firm and resolute.
  4205	
  4206	The countess tried to frown, but could not. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna shook her
  4207	fat finger.
  4208	
  4209	âCossack!â she said threateningly.
  4210	
  4211	Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the
  4212	elders.
  4213	
  4214	âYou had better take care!â said the countess.
  4215	
  4216	âMamma! What sweets are we going to have?â NatÃ¡sha again cried
  4217	boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in
  4218	good part.
  4219	
  4220	SÃ³nya and fat little PÃ©tya doubled up with laughter.
  4221	
  4222	âYou see! I have asked,â whispered NatÃ¡sha to her little brother
  4223	and to Pierre, glancing at him again.
  4224	
  4225	âIce pudding, but you wonât get any,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
  4226	
  4227	NatÃ¡sha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
  4228	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
  4229	
  4230	âMÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna! What kind of ice pudding? I donât like ice
  4231	cream.â
  4232	
  4233	âCarrot ices.â
  4234	
  4235	âNo! What kind, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna? What kind?â she almost screamed;
  4236	âI want to know!â
  4237	
  4238	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the
  4239	guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs answer
  4240	but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had
  4241	dared to treat MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna in this fashion.
  4242	
  4243	NatÃ¡sha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
  4244	pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band
  4245	again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving
  4246	their seats, went up to âcongratulateâ the countess, and reached
  4247	across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and
  4248	with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and
  4249	in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the
  4250	guests returned to the drawing room and to the countâs study.
  4251	
  4252	
  4253	
  4254	
  4255	
  4256	CHAPTER XX
  4257	
  4258	The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the
  4259	countâs visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,
  4260	some in the sitting room, some in the library.
  4261	
  4262	The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from
  4263	dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything.
  4264	The young people, at the countessâ instigation, gathered round the
  4265	clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she
  4266	had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the
  4267	other young ladies in begging NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas, who were noted for
  4268	their musical talent, to sing something. NatÃ¡sha, who was treated as
  4269	though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the
  4270	same time felt shy.
  4271	
  4272	âWhat shall we sing?â she said.
  4273	
  4274	ââThe Brook,ââ suggested Nicholas.
  4275	
  4276	âWell, then, letâs be quick. BorÃ­s, come here,â said NatÃ¡sha.
  4277	âBut where is SÃ³nya?â
  4278	
  4279	She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
  4280	look for her.
  4281	
  4282	Running into SÃ³nyaâs room and not finding her there, NatÃ¡sha ran to
  4283	the nursery, but SÃ³nya was not there either. NatÃ¡sha concluded that
  4284	she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was
  4285	the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the RostÃ³v
  4286	household. And there in fact was SÃ³nya lying face downward on Nurseâs
  4287	dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink
  4288	dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing
  4289	so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. NatÃ¡shaâs
  4290	face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saintâs day, suddenly
  4291	changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad
  4292	neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.
  4293	
  4294	âSÃ³nya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!â And
  4295	NatÃ¡shaâs large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she
  4296	began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that SÃ³nya was
  4297	crying. SÃ³nya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and
  4298	hid her face still deeper in the bed. NatÃ¡sha wept, sitting on the
  4299	blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort SÃ³nya
  4300	sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.
  4301	
  4302	âNicholas is going away in a weekâs time, his... papers... have
  4303	come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,â and she
  4304	showed a paper she held in her handâwith the verses Nicholas had
  4305	written, âstill, I should not cry, but you canât... no one can
  4306	understand... what a soul he has!â
  4307	
  4308	And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.
  4309	
  4310	âItâs all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and
  4311	BorÃ­s also,â she went on, gaining a little strength; âhe is nice...
  4312	there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...
  4313	one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it
  4314	canât be done. And besides, if she tells Mammaâ (SÃ³nya looked upon
  4315	the countess as her mother and called her so) âthat I am spoiling
  4316	Nicholasâ career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God
  4317	is my witness,â and she made the sign of the cross, âI love her so
  4318	much, and all of you, only VÃ©ra... And what for? What have I done
  4319	to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice
  4320	everything, only I have nothing....â
  4321	
  4322	SÃ³nya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in
  4323	the feather bed. NatÃ¡sha began consoling her, but her face showed that
  4324	she understood all the gravity of her friendâs trouble.
  4325	
  4326	âSÃ³nya,â she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true
  4327	reason of her friendâs sorrow, âIâm sure VÃ©ra has said something
  4328	to you since dinner? Hasnât she?â
  4329	
  4330	âYes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others,
  4331	and she found them on my table and said sheâd show them to Mamma, and
  4332	that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry
  4333	me, but that heâll marry Julie. You see how heâs been with her all
  4334	day... NatÃ¡sha, what have I done to deserve it?...â
  4335	
  4336	And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. NatÃ¡sha lifted
  4337	her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting
  4338	her.
  4339	
  4340	âSÃ³nya, donât believe her, darling! Donât believe her! Do you
  4341	remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting
  4342	room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I donât
  4343	quite remember how, but donât you remember that it could all be
  4344	arranged and how nice it all was? Thereâs Uncle ShinshÃ­nâs brother
  4345	has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.
  4346	And BorÃ­s says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about
  4347	it. And he is so clever and so good!â said NatÃ¡sha. âDonât
  4348	you cry, SÃ³nya, dear love, darling SÃ³nya!â and she kissed her and
  4349	laughed. âVÃ©raâs spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right
  4350	and she wonât say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself,
  4351	and he doesnât care at all for Julie.â
  4352	
  4353	NatÃ¡sha kissed her on the hair.
  4354	
  4355	SÃ³nya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it
  4356	seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin
  4357	playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.
  4358	
  4359	âDo you think so?... Really? Truly?â she said, quickly smoothing her
  4360	frock and hair.
  4361	
  4362	âReally, truly!â answered NatÃ¡sha, pushing in a crisp lock that had
  4363	strayed from under her friendâs plaits.
  4364	
  4365	Both laughed.
  4366	
  4367	âWell, letâs go and sing âThe Brook.ââ
  4368	
  4369	âCome along!â
  4370	
  4371	âDo you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!â said
  4372	NatÃ¡sha, stopping suddenly. âI feel so happy!â
  4373	
  4374	And she set off at a run along the passage.
  4375	
  4376	SÃ³nya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
  4377	verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran
  4378	after NatÃ¡sha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
  4379	and light, joyous steps. At the visitorsâ request the young people
  4380	sang the quartette, âThe Brook,â with which everyone was delighted.
  4381	Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:
  4382	
  4383	   At nighttime in the moonâs fair glow
  4384	     How sweet, as fancies wander free,
  4385	   To feel that in this world thereâs one
  4386	     Who still is thinking but of thee!
  4387	
  4388	   That while her fingers touch the harp
  4389	     Wafting sweet music oâer the lea,
  4390	   It is for thee thus swells her heart,
  4391	     Sighing its message out to thee...
  4392	
  4393	   A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,
  4394	     But oh! till then I cannot live!...
  4395	
  4396	He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to
  4397	get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the
  4398	coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.
  4399	
  4400	
  4401	Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where ShinshÃ­n had engaged him,
  4402	as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in
  4403	which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began
  4404	NatÃ¡sha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and
  4405	blushing:
  4406	
  4407	âMamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.â
  4408	
  4409	âI am afraid of mixing the figures,â Pierre replied; âbut if you
  4410	will be my teacher...â And lowering his big arm he offered it to the
  4411	slender little girl.
  4412	
  4413	While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,
  4414	Pierre sat down with his little partner. NatÃ¡sha was perfectly happy;
  4415	she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was
  4416	sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady.
  4417	She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold.
  4418	Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where
  4419	she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and
  4420	smiling over the fan.
  4421	
  4422	âDear, dear! Just look at her!â exclaimed the countess as she
  4423	crossed the ballroom, pointing to NatÃ¡sha.
  4424	
  4425	NatÃ¡sha blushed and laughed.
  4426	
  4427	âWell, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised
  4428	at?â
  4429	
  4430	
  4431	In the midst of the third Ã©cossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
  4432	pushed back in the sitting room where the count and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
  4433	had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and
  4434	older visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long,
  4435	and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First
  4436	came MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The
  4437	count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his
  4438	bent arm to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair
  4439	gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the
  4440	Ã©cossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted
  4441	up to their gallery, addressing the first violin:
  4442	
  4443	âSemÃ«n! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?â
  4444	
  4445	This was the countâs favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.
  4446	(Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)
  4447	
  4448	âLook at Papa!â shouted NatÃ¡sha to the whole company, and quite
  4449	forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her
  4450	curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.
  4451	
  4452	And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
  4453	jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,
  4454	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his
  4455	shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by
  4456	a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the
  4457	onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay
  4458	strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant
  4459	dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly
  4460	filled by the domestic serfsâthe men on one side and the women on
  4461	the otherâwho with beaming faces had come to see their master making
  4462	merry.
  4463	
  4464	âJust look at the master! A regular eagle he is!â loudly remarked
  4465	the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.
  4466	
  4467	The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not
  4468	want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms
  4469	hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her
  4470	stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed
  4471	by the whole of the countâs plump figure, in MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna found
  4472	expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.
  4473	But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed
  4474	the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and
  4475	the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, MÃ¡rya
  4476	DmÃ­trievna produced no less impression by slight exertionsâthe least
  4477	effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp
  4478	her footâwhich everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual
  4479	severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could
  4480	not attract a momentâs attention to their own evolutions and did not
  4481	even try to do so. All were watching the count and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
  4482	NatÃ¡sha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to
  4483	âlook at Papa!â though as it was they never took their eyes off the
  4484	couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved
  4485	and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster;
  4486	lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying
  4487	round MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until,
  4488	turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas,
  4489	raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling
  4490	and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and
  4491	laughter led by NatÃ¡sha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily
  4492	and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.
  4493	
  4494	âThatâs how we used to dance in our time, ma chÃ¨re,â said the
  4495	count.
  4496	
  4497	âThat was a Daniel Cooper!â exclaimed MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, tucking up
  4498	her sleeves and puffing heavily.
  4499	
  4500	
  4501

  4504	CHAPTER XXI
  4505	
  4506	While in the RostÃ³vsâ ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced,
  4507	to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired
  4508	footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count BezÃºkhov had a
  4509	sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute
  4510	confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations
  4511	made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle
  4512	and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond
  4513	the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up,
  4514	waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral.
  4515	The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending
  4516	aides-de-camp to inquire after the countâs health, came himself
  4517	that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of
  4518	Catherineâs court, Count BezÃºkhov.
  4519	
  4520	The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up
  4521	respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an
  4522	hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their
  4523	bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
  4524	on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince
  4525	VasÃ­li, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days,
  4526	escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in
  4527	low tones.
  4528	
  4529	When the Military Governor had gone, Prince VasÃ­li sat down all alone
  4530	on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other,
  4531	leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After
  4532	sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened
  4533	eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading
  4534	to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.
  4535	
  4536	Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
  4537	whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying manâs
  4538	room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at
  4539	his door, which creaked slightly when opened.
  4540	
  4541	âThe limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be
  4542	oâerpassed,â said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat
  4543	beside him and was listening naÃ¯vely to his words.
  4544	
  4545	âI wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?â asked the
  4546	lady, adding the priestâs clerical title, as if she had no opinion of
  4547	her own on the subject.
  4548	
  4549	âAh, madam, it is a great sacrament,â replied the priest, passing
  4550	his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his
  4551	bald head.
  4552	
  4553	âWho was that? The Military Governor himself?â was being asked at
  4554	the other side of the room. âHow young-looking he is!â
  4555	
  4556	âYes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes
  4557	anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.â
  4558	
  4559	âI knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.â
  4560	
  4561	The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
  4562	from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a
  4563	graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a
  4564	table.
  4565	
  4566	âBeautiful,â said the doctor in answer to a remark about the
  4567	weather. âThe weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow
  4568	one feels as if one were in the country.â
  4569	
  4570	âYes, indeed,â replied the princess with a sigh. âSo he may have
  4571	something to drink?â
  4572	
  4573	Lorrain considered.
  4574	
  4575	âHas he taken his medicine?â
  4576	
  4577	âYes.â
  4578	
  4579	The doctor glanced at his watch.
  4580	
  4581	âTake a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,â
  4582	and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.
  4583	
  4584	âDere has neffer been a gase,â a German doctor was saying to an
  4585	aide-de-camp, âdat one liffs after de sird stroke.â
  4586	
  4587	âAnd what a well-preserved man he was!â remarked the aide-de-camp.
  4588	âAnd who will inherit his wealth?â he added in a whisper.
  4589	
  4590	âIt vonât go begging,â replied the German with a smile.
  4591	
  4592	Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second
  4593	princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to
  4594	Lorrainâs instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.
  4595	
  4596	âDo you think he can last till morning?â asked the German,
  4597	addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.
  4598	
  4599	Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before
  4600	his nose.
  4601	
  4602	âTonight, not later,â said he in a low voice, and he moved away
  4603	with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to
  4604	understand and state the patientâs condition.
  4605	
  4606	Meanwhile Prince VasÃ­li had opened the door into the princessâ room.
  4607	
  4608	In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before
  4609	the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.
  4610	The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,
  4611	cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was
  4612	just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.
  4613	
  4614	âAh, is it you, cousin?â
  4615	
  4616	She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth
  4617	that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with
  4618	varnish.
  4619	
  4620	âHas anything happened?â she asked. âI am so terrified.â
  4621	
  4622	âNo, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,
  4623	Catiche,â * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair
  4624	she had just vacated. âYou have made the place warm, I must say,â he
  4625	remarked. âWell, sit down: letâs have a talk.â
  4626	
  4627	     *Catherine.
  4628	
  4629	âI thought perhaps something had happened,â she said with her
  4630	unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the
  4631	prince, she prepared to listen.
  4632	
  4633	âI wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I canât.â
  4634	
  4635	âWell, my dear?â said Prince VasÃ­li, taking her hand and bending it
  4636	downwards as was his habit.
  4637	
  4638	It was plain that this âwell?â referred to much that they both
  4639	understood without naming.
  4640	
  4641	The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her
  4642	legs, looked directly at Prince VasÃ­li with no sign of emotion in her
  4643	prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
  4644	with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow
  4645	and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince
  4646	VasÃ­li understood it as an expression of weariness.
  4647	
  4648	âAnd I?â he said; âdo you think it is easier for me? I am as worn
  4649	out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a
  4650	very serious talk.â
  4651	
  4652	Prince VasÃ­li said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,
  4653	now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant
  4654	expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes
  4655	too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the
  4656	next glanced round in alarm.
  4657	
  4658	The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
  4659	hands, looked attentively into Prince VasÃ­liâs eyes evidently
  4660	resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till
  4661	morning.
  4662	
  4663	âWell, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine SemÃ«novna,â
  4664	continued Prince VasÃ­li, returning to his theme, apparently not
  4665	without an inner struggle; âat such a moment as this one must think
  4666	of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you
  4667	all, like children of my own, as you know.â
  4668	
  4669	The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same
  4670	dull expression.
  4671	
  4672	âAnd then of course my family has also to be considered,â Prince
  4673	VasÃ­li went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at
  4674	her. âYou know, Catiche, that weâyou three sisters, MÃ¡montov, and
  4675	my wifeâare the countâs only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard
  4676	it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for
  4677	me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for
  4678	anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,â pointing to
  4679	his portrait, âdefinitely demanded that he should be called.â
  4680	
  4681	Prince VasÃ­li looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make
  4682	out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was
  4683	simply looking at him.
  4684	
  4685	âThere is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,â she
  4686	replied, âand it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow
  4687	his noble soul peacefully to leave this...â
  4688	
  4689	âYes, yes, of course,â interrupted Prince VasÃ­li impatiently,
  4690	rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little
  4691	table that he had pushed away. âBut... in short, the fact is... you
  4692	know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left
  4693	all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.â
  4694	
  4695	âHe has made wills enough!â quietly remarked the princess. âBut he
  4696	cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.â
  4697	
  4698	âBut, my dear,â said Prince VasÃ­li suddenly, clutching the little
  4699	table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: âwhat if
  4700	a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for
  4701	Pierreâs legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the
  4702	countâs services, his request would be granted?...â
  4703	
  4704	The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the
  4705	subject under discussion than those they are talking with.
  4706	
  4707	âI can tell you more,â continued Prince VasÃ­li, seizing her hand,
  4708	âthat letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew
  4709	of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then
  4710	as soon as all is over,â and Prince VasÃ­li sighed to intimate what he
  4711	meant by the words all is over, âand the countâs papers are opened,
  4712	the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition
  4713	will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate
  4714	son.â
  4715	
  4716	âAnd our share?â asked the princess smiling ironically, as if
  4717	anything might happen, only not that.
  4718	
  4719	âBut, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the
  4720	legal heir to everything and you wonât get anything. You must know,
  4721	my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have
  4722	been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you
  4723	ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...â
  4724	
  4725	âWhat next?â the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not
  4726	changing the expression of her eyes. âI am a woman, and you think we
  4727	are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...
  4728	un bÃ¢tard!â* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the
  4729	word would effectively prove to Prince VasÃ­li the invalidity of his
  4730	contention.
  4731	
  4732	     * A bastard.
  4733	
  4734	âWell, really, Catiche! Canât you understand! You are so
  4735	intelligent, how is it you donât see that if the count has written a
  4736	letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it
  4737	follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count BezÃºkhov,
  4738	and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and
  4739	letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation
  4740	of having been dutiful et tout ce qui sâensuit!* Thatâs certain.â
  4741	
  4742	     * And all that follows therefrom.
  4743	
  4744	âI know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid;
  4745	and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,â said the
  4746	princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are
  4747	saying something witty and stinging.
  4748	
  4749	âMy dear Princess Catherine SemÃ«novna,â began Prince VasÃ­li
  4750	impatiently, âI came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about
  4751	your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I
  4752	tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the
  4753	will in Pierreâs favor are among the countâs papers, then, my dear
  4754	girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you donât believe me,
  4755	then believe an expert. I have just been talking to DmÃ­tri OnÃºfrichâ
  4756	(the family solicitor) âand he says the same.â
  4757	
  4758	At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princessâ ideas;
  4759	her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice
  4760	when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
  4761	evidently did not expect.
  4762	
  4763	âThat would be a fine thing!â said she. âI never wanted anything
  4764	and I donât now.â
  4765	
  4766	She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.
  4767	
  4768	âAnd this is gratitudeâthis is recognition for those who have
  4769	sacrificed everything for his sake!â she cried. âItâs splendid!
  4770	Fine! I donât want anything, Prince.â
  4771	
  4772	âYes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...â
  4773	replied Prince VasÃ­li.
  4774	
  4775	But the princess did not listen to him.
  4776	
  4777	âYes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect
  4778	nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitudeâthe
  4779	blackest ingratitudeâin this house...â
  4780	
  4781	âDo you or do you not know where that will is?â insisted Prince
  4782	VasÃ­li, his cheeks twitching more than ever.
  4783	
  4784	âYes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and
  4785	sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has
  4786	been intriguing!â
  4787	
  4788	The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She
  4789	had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.
  4790	She gave her companion an angry glance.
  4791	
  4792	âThere is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was
  4793	all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards
  4794	forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his
  4795	last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let
  4796	him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...â
  4797	
  4798	âWho sacrificed everything for him,â chimed in the princess, who
  4799	would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, âthough
  4800	he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,â she added with a sigh,
  4801	âI shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward,
  4802	that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one
  4803	has to be cunning and cruel.â
  4804	
  4805	âNow come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.â
  4806	
  4807	âNo, I have a wicked heart.â
  4808	
  4809	âI know your heart,â repeated the prince. âI value your friendship
  4810	and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Donât upset yourself,
  4811	and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it
  4812	but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where
  4813	it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the
  4814	count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.
  4815	You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his
  4816	wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him
  4817	and you.â
  4818	
  4819	âNow I see it all! I know who has been intriguingâI know!â cried
  4820	the princess.
  4821	
  4822	âThatâs not the point, my dear.â
  4823	
  4824	âItâs that protÃ©gÃ© of yours, that sweet Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya,
  4825	that Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the
  4826	infamous, vile woman!â
  4827	
  4828	âDo not let us lose any time...â
  4829	
  4830	âAh, donât talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and
  4831	told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about
  4832	SophieâI canât repeat themâthat it made the count quite ill and he
  4833	would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this
  4834	vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.â
  4835	
  4836	âWeâve got to it at lastâwhy did you not tell me about it
  4837	sooner?â
  4838	
  4839	âItâs in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,â
  4840	said the princess, ignoring his question. âNow I know! Yes; if I have
  4841	a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!â almost shrieked
  4842	the princess, now quite changed. âAnd what does she come worming
  4843	herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time
  4844	will come!â
  4845	
  4846	
  4847	
  4848	
  4849	
  4850	CHAPTER XXII
  4851	
  4852	While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the
  4853	princessâ room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for)
  4854	and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was
  4855	driving into the court of Count BezÃºkhovâs house. As the wheels
  4856	rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,
  4857	having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that
  4858	he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre
  4859	followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna out of the carriage, and only then began
  4860	to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He
  4861	noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back
  4862	door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who
  4863	looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the
  4864	shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other
  4865	men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides.
  4866	But neither Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who
  4867	could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. âIt seems
  4868	to be all right,â Pierre concluded, and followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna.
  4869	She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to
  4870	Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it
  4871	was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had
  4872	to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs air
  4873	of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely
  4874	necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by
  4875	some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots
  4876	clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna
  4877	MikhÃ¡ylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them
  4878	there.
  4879	
  4880	âIs this the way to the princessesâ apartments?â asked Anna
  4881	MikhÃ¡ylovna of one of them.
  4882	
  4883	âYes,â replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were
  4884	now permissible; âthe door to the left, maâam.â
  4885	
  4886	âPerhaps the count did not ask for me,â said Pierre when he reached
  4887	the landing. âIâd better go to my own room.â
  4888	
  4889	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna paused and waited for him to come up.
  4890	
  4891	âAh, my friend!â she said, touching his arm as she had done her
  4892	sonâs when speaking to him that afternoon, âbelieve me I suffer no
  4893	less than you do, but be a man!â
  4894	
  4895	âBut really, hadnât I better go away?â he asked, looking kindly at
  4896	her over his spectacles.
  4897	
  4898	âAh, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you.
  4899	Think that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.â She
  4900	sighed. âI have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to
  4901	me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.â
  4902	
  4903	Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had
  4904	to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna who was
  4905	already opening a door.
  4906	
  4907	This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the
  4908	princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been
  4909	in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
  4910	these rooms. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past
  4911	with a decanter on a tray as âmy dearâ and âmy sweet,â asked
  4912	about the princessâ health and then led Pierre along a stone passage.
  4913	The first door on the left led into the princessesâ apartments. The
  4914	maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything
  4915	in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna
  4916	MikhÃ¡ylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where
  4917	Prince VasÃ­li and the eldest princess were sitting close together
  4918	talking. Seeing them pass, Prince VasÃ­li drew back with obvious
  4919	impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of
  4920	desperation slammed the door with all her might.
  4921	
  4922	This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on
  4923	Prince VasÃ­liâs face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre
  4924	stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna
  4925	MikhÃ¡ylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as
  4926	if to say that this was no more than she had expected.
  4927	
  4928	âBe a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,â said she in
  4929	reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.
  4930	
  4931	Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what
  4932	âwatching over his interestsâ meant, but he decided that all these
  4933	things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly
  4934	lit room adjoining the countâs reception room. It was one of those
  4935	sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front
  4936	approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water
  4937	had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer
  4938	and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They
  4939	went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian
  4940	windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full
  4941	length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still
  4942	sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one
  4943	another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna
  4944	MikhÃ¡ylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who,
  4945	hanging his head, meekly followed her.
  4946	
  4947	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs face expressed a consciousness that the decisive
  4948	moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now,
  4949	keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than
  4950	that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the
  4951	dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid
  4952	glance at all those in the room and noticing the countâs confessor
  4953	there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet
  4954	seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing
  4955	first of one and then of another priest.
  4956	
  4957	âGod be thanked that you are in time,â said she to one of the
  4958	priests; âall we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young
  4959	man is the countâs son,â she added more softly. âWhat a terrible
  4960	moment!â
  4961	
  4962	Having said this she went up to the doctor.
  4963	
  4964	âDear doctor,â said she, âthis young man is the countâs son. Is
  4965	there any hope?â
  4966	
  4967	The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
  4968	shoulders. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with just the same movement raised her
  4969	shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away
  4970	from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and
  4971	tenderly sad voice, she said:
  4972	
  4973	âTrust in His mercy!â and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit
  4974	and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was
  4975	watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.
  4976	
  4977	Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved
  4978	toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna had
  4979	disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him
  4980	with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they
  4981	whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind
  4982	of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before
  4983	received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to
  4984	the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up
  4985	and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully
  4986	silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre
  4987	wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to
  4988	pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not
  4989	even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and
  4990	that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful
  4991	rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound
  4992	to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the
  4993	aide-de-camp, and sat down in the ladyâs chair, placing his huge hands
  4994	symmetrically on his knees in the naÃ¯ve attitude of an Egyptian statue,
  4995	and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in
  4996	order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his
  4997	own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of
  4998	those who were guiding him.
  4999	
  5000	Not two minutes had passed before Prince VasÃ­li with head erect
  5001	majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three
  5002	stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning;
  5003	his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed
  5004	Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do),
  5005	and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly
  5006	fixed on.
  5007	
  5008	âCourage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is
  5009	well!â and he turned to go.
  5010	
  5011	But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: âHow is...â and hesitated,
  5012	not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man âthe
  5013	count,â yet ashamed to call him âfather.â
  5014	
  5015	âHe had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my
  5016	friend...â
  5017	
  5018	Pierreâs mind was in such a confused state that the word âstrokeâ
  5019	suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince VasÃ­li
  5020	in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
  5021	illness. Prince VasÃ­li said something to Lorrain in passing and went
  5022	through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his
  5023	whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and
  5024	the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.
  5025	Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and
  5026	at last Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, still with the same expression, pale but
  5027	resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly
  5028	on the arm said:
  5029	
  5030	âThe divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be
  5031	administered. Come.â
  5032	
  5033	Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed
  5034	that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all
  5035	followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to
  5036	enter that room.
  5037	
  5038	
  5039	
  5040	
  5041	
  5042	CHAPTER XXIII
  5043	
  5044	Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its
  5045	walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the
  5046	columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and
  5047	on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated
  5048	with red light like a Russian church during evening service. Under
  5049	the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair
  5050	on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre
  5051	sawâcovered to the waist by a bright green quiltâthe familiar,
  5052	majestic figure of his father, Count BezÃºkhov, with that gray mane of
  5053	hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep
  5054	characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay
  5055	just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the
  5056	right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust
  5057	between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from
  5058	behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests,
  5059	their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments,
  5060	with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the
  5061	service. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding
  5062	handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest
  5063	sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on
  5064	the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for
  5065	herself should she glance round. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with a meek,
  5066	sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door
  5067	near the strange lady. Prince VasÃ­li in front of the door, near the
  5068	invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on
  5069	the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose,
  5070	and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward
  5071	each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety
  5072	and resignation to the will of God. âIf you do not understand these
  5073	sentiments,â he seemed to be saying, âso much the worse for you!â
  5074	
  5075	Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;
  5076	the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing
  5077	themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting
  5078	of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of
  5079	feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with
  5080	an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she
  5081	was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave
  5082	him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him,
  5083	began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.
  5084	
  5085	Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,
  5086	watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained
  5087	with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she
  5088	again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him
  5089	without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of
  5090	temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst
  5091	of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered
  5092	to one another, and the old servant who was holding the countâs hand
  5093	got up and said something to the ladies. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna stepped
  5094	forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from
  5095	behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning
  5096	against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he,
  5097	a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full
  5098	importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He
  5099	now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor
  5100	of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the
  5101	hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected
  5102	a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a
  5103	stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service
  5104	continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince VasÃ­li
  5105	left the chair on which he had been leaning, andâwith an air
  5106	which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not
  5107	understand him it was so much the worse for themâdid not go up to the
  5108	dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved
  5109	with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its
  5110	silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince VasÃ­li and the princess
  5111	passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the
  5112	other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention
  5113	to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his
  5114	mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was
  5115	in some way essential.
  5116	
  5117	The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was
  5118	heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
  5119	sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around
  5120	him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which
  5121	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs was the most distinct.
  5122	
  5123	Pierre heard her say:
  5124	
  5125	âCertainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be
  5126	impossible...â
  5127	
  5128	The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants
  5129	that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray
  5130	maneâwhich, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight
  5131	of for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the
  5132	cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that
  5133	they had lifted the dying man and were moving him.
  5134	
  5135	âCatch hold of my arm or youâll drop him!â he heard one of the
  5136	servants say in a frightened whisper. âCatch hold from underneath.
  5137	Here!â exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the
  5138	bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the
  5139	weight they were carrying were too much for them.
  5140	
  5141	As the bearers, among whom was Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, passed the young man
  5142	he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying
  5143	manâs high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by
  5144	those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,
  5145	leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones,
  5146	its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was
  5147	not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre
  5148	remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to
  5149	Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven
  5150	movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon
  5151	nothing.
  5152	
  5153	After a few minutesâ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had
  5154	carried the sick man dispersed. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna touched Pierreâs
  5155	hand and said, âCome.â Pierre went with her to the bed on which the
  5156	sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony
  5157	just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His
  5158	hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms
  5159	downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but
  5160	with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal
  5161	man. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes
  5162	they must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated,
  5163	not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna
  5164	MikhÃ¡ylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick
  5165	manâs hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre,
  5166	carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her
  5167	suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither
  5168	the hand nor a single muscle of the countâs face stirred. Once more
  5169	Pierre looked questioningly at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna to see what he was to
  5170	do next. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood
  5171	beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were
  5172	doing right. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell
  5173	into the naÃ¯vely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently
  5174	distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing
  5175	his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who
  5176	still gazed at the spot where Pierreâs face had been before he sat
  5177	down. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of
  5178	the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the
  5179	father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an
  5180	hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the countâs face began
  5181	to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one
  5182	side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and
  5183	from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna
  5184	MikhÃ¡ylovna looked attentively at the sick manâs eyes, trying to
  5185	guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink,
  5186	then named Prince VasÃ­li in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the
  5187	quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an
  5188	effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the
  5189	bed.
  5190	
  5191	âWants to turn on the other side,â whispered the servant, and got up
  5192	to turn the countâs heavy body toward the wall.
  5193	
  5194	Pierre rose to help him.
  5195	
  5196	While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back
  5197	helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he
  5198	noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm,
  5199	or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any
  5200	rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierreâs terror-stricken
  5201	face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile
  5202	appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride
  5203	his own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected
  5204	quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his
  5205	eyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall.
  5206	He sighed.
  5207	
  5208	âHe is dozing,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, observing that one of the
  5209	princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. âLet us go.â
  5210	
  5211	Pierre went out.
  5212	
  5213	
  5214	
  5215	
  5216	
  5217	CHAPTER XXIV
  5218	
  5219	There was now no one in the reception room except Prince VasÃ­li and the
  5220	eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the
  5221	Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion
  5222	they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide
  5223	something as she whispered:
  5224	
  5225	âI canât bear the sight of that woman.â
  5226	
  5227	âCatiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,â said Prince
  5228	VasÃ­li to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âGo and take something, my poor Anna
  5229	MikhÃ¡ylovna, or you will not hold out.â
  5230	
  5231	To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
  5232	below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna into the small
  5233	drawing room.
  5234	
  5235	âThere is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup
  5236	of this delicious Russian tea,â Lorrain was saying with an air of
  5237	restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese
  5238	handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid
  5239	in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count
  5240	BezÃºkhovâs house that night had gathered to fortify themselves.
  5241	Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors
  5242	and little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not
  5243	know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies
  5244	who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and
  5245	pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly
  5246	lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now
  5247	this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea
  5248	things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the
  5249	night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly
  5250	whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none
  5251	of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the
  5252	bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have
  5253	liked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was
  5254	again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince
  5255	VasÃ­li and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was
  5256	essential, and after a short interval followed her. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
  5257	was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited
  5258	whispers.
  5259	
  5260	âPermit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not
  5261	necessary,â said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the
  5262	same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.
  5263	
  5264	âBut, my dear princess,â answered Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna blandly but
  5265	impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
  5266	from passing, âwonât this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment
  5267	when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is
  5268	already prepared...â
  5269	
  5270	Prince VasÃ­li was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude,
  5271	with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so
  5272	flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but
  5273	he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were
  5274	saying.
  5275	
  5276	âCome, my dear Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You
  5277	know how fond the count is of her.â
  5278	
  5279	âI donât even know what is in this paper,â said the younger of
  5280	the two ladies, addressing Prince VasÃ­li and pointing to an inlaid
  5281	portfolio she held in her hand. âAll I know is that his real will is
  5282	in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....â
  5283	
  5284	She tried to pass Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar
  5285	her path.
  5286	
  5287	âI know, my dear, kind princess,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, seizing
  5288	the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.
  5289	âDear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous
  5290	en conjure...â
  5291	
  5292	The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the
  5293	portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if
  5294	the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna
  5295	MikhÃ¡ylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none
  5296	of its honeyed firmness and softness.
  5297	
  5298	âPierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a
  5299	family consultation; is it not so, Prince?â
  5300	
  5301	âWhy donât you speak, cousin?â suddenly shrieked the princess so
  5302	loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. âWhy
  5303	do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to
  5304	interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying manâs room?
  5305	Intriguer!â she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the
  5306	portfolio.
  5307	
  5308	But Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
  5309	portfolio, and changed her grip.
  5310	
  5311	Prince VasÃ­li rose. âOh!â said he with reproach and surprise,
  5312	âthis is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.â
  5313	
  5314	The princess let go.
  5315	
  5316	âAnd you too!â
  5317	
  5318	But Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna did not obey him.
  5319	
  5320	âLet go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go
  5321	and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?â
  5322	
  5323	âBut, Prince,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, âafter such a solemn
  5324	sacrament, allow him a momentâs peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your
  5325	opinion,â said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite
  5326	close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess
  5327	which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince
  5328	VasÃ­li.
  5329	
  5330	âRemember that you will answer for the consequences,â said Prince
  5331	VasÃ­li severely. âYou donât know what you are doing.â
  5332	
  5333	âVile woman!â shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna
  5334	MikhÃ¡ylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.
  5335	
  5336	Prince VasÃ­li bent his head and spread out his hands.
  5337	
  5338	At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long
  5339	and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged
  5340	against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out
  5341	wringing her hands.
  5342	
  5343	âWhat are you doing!â she cried vehemently. âHe is dying and you
  5344	leave me alone with him!â
  5345	
  5346	Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, stooping, quickly
  5347	caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest
  5348	princess and Prince VasÃ­li, recovering themselves, followed her. A few
  5349	minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again
  5350	biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an
  5351	irrepressible hatred.
  5352	
  5353	âYes, now you may be glad!â said she; âthis is what you have
  5354	been waiting for.â And bursting into tears she hid her face in her
  5355	handkerchief and rushed from the room.
  5356	
  5357	Prince VasÃ­li came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was
  5358	sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre
  5359	noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
  5360	ague.
  5361	
  5362	âAh, my friend!â said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was
  5363	in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it
  5364	before. âHow often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am
  5365	near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is
  5366	awful...â and he burst into tears.
  5367	
  5368	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet
  5369	steps.
  5370	
  5371	âPierre!â she said.
  5372	
  5373	Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his
  5374	forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:
  5375	
  5376	âHe is no more....â
  5377	
  5378	Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.
  5379	
  5380	âCome, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as
  5381	tears.â
  5382	
  5383	She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could
  5384	see his face. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna left him, and when she returned he was
  5385	fast asleep with his head on his arm.
  5386	
  5387	In the morning Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna said to Pierre:
  5388	
  5389	âYes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.
  5390	But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command
  5391	of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you
  5392	well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes
  5393	duties on you, and you must be a man.â
  5394	
  5395	Pierre was silent.
  5396	
  5397	âPerhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been
  5398	there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised
  5399	me only the day before yesterday not to forget BorÃ­s. But he had
  5400	no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your fatherâs
  5401	wish?â
  5402	
  5403	Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
  5404	silence at Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna
  5405	MikhÃ¡ylovna returned to the RostÃ³vsâ and went to bed. On waking in
  5406	the morning she told the RostÃ³vs and all her acquaintances the details
  5407	of Count BezÃºkhovâs death. She said the count had died as she would
  5408	herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As
  5409	to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she
  5410	could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved
  5411	better during those awful momentsâthe father who so remembered
  5412	everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to
  5413	the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he
  5414	with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his
  5415	dying father. âIt is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the
  5416	soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,â said she.
  5417	Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince VasÃ­li she spoke
  5418	disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.
  5419	
  5420	
  5421	
  5422	
  5423	
  5424	CHAPTER XXV
  5425	
  5426	At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas AndrÃ©evich BolkÃ³nskiâs estate, the
  5427	arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but
  5428	this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old
  5429	princeâs household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas AndrÃ©evich
  5430	(nicknamed in society, âthe King of Prussiaâ) ever since the Emperor
  5431	Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
  5432	with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle
  5433	Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the
  5434	capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that
  5435	anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to
  5436	Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to
  5437	say that there are only two sources of human viceâidleness and
  5438	superstition, and only two virtuesâactivity and intelligence. He
  5439	himself undertook his daughterâs education, and to develop these two
  5440	cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry
  5441	till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was
  5442	occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving
  5443	problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working
  5444	in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on
  5445	at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity,
  5446	regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of
  5447	exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions,
  5448	and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about
  5449	him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably
  5450	exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear
  5451	and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was
  5452	in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high
  5453	official appointed to the province in which the princeâs estate lay
  5454	considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber
  5455	just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince
  5456	appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this
  5457	antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when
  5458	the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather
  5459	small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray
  5460	eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd,
  5461	youthfully glittering eyes.
  5462	
  5463	On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess
  5464	Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the
  5465	morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a
  5466	silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning
  5467	prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.
  5468	
  5469	An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
  5470	quietly and said in a whisper: âPlease walk in.â
  5471	
  5472	Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly
  5473	opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the
  5474	entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round
  5475	continued his work.
  5476	
  5477	The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use.
  5478	The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted
  5479	bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while
  5480	standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with
  5481	tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundâall indicated
  5482	continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot
  5483	shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure
  5484	of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the
  5485	tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns
  5486	of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel,
  5487	dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching
  5488	the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing,
  5489	so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding
  5490	her tenderly and attentively, said severely:
  5491	
  5492	âQuite well? All right then, sit down.â He took the exercise book
  5493	containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
  5494	with his foot.
  5495	
  5496	âFor tomorrow!â said he, quickly finding the page and making a
  5497	scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.
  5498	
  5499	The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.
  5500	
  5501	âWait a bit, hereâs a letter for you,â said the old man suddenly,
  5502	taking a letter addressed in a womanâs hand from a bag hanging above
  5503	the table, onto which he threw it.
  5504	
  5505	At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
  5506	princessâ face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.
  5507	
  5508	âFrom HÃ©loÃ¯se?â asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his
  5509	still sound, yellowish teeth.
  5510	
  5511	âYes, itâs from Julie,â replied the princess with a timid glance
  5512	and a timid smile.
  5513	
  5514	âIâll let two more letters pass, but the third Iâll read,â said
  5515	the prince sternly; âIâm afraid you write much nonsense. Iâll read
  5516	the third!â
  5517	
  5518	âRead this if you like, Father,â said the princess, blushing still
  5519	more and holding out the letter.
  5520	
  5521	âThe third, I said the third!â cried the prince abruptly, pushing
  5522	the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him
  5523	the exercise book containing geometrical figures.
  5524	
  5525	âWell, madam,â he began, stooping over the book close to his
  5526	daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat,
  5527	so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of
  5528	old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. âNow, madam, these
  5529	triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...â
  5530	
  5531	The princess looked in a scared way at her fatherâs eyes glittering
  5532	close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was
  5533	plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her
  5534	fear would prevent her understanding any of her fatherâs further
  5535	explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the
  5536	teacherâs fault or the pupilâs, this same thing happened every day:
  5537	the princessâ eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear
  5538	anything, but was only conscious of her stern fatherâs withered face
  5539	close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only
  5540	of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in
  5541	peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was
  5542	sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself
  5543	and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded,
  5544	and sometimes flung the exercise book away.
  5545	
  5546	The princess gave a wrong answer.
  5547	
  5548	âWell now, isnât she a fool!â shouted the prince, pushing the book
  5549	aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and
  5550	down, lightly touched his daughterâs hair and sat down again.
  5551	
  5552	He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.
  5553	
  5554	âThis wonât do, Princess; it wonât do,â said he, when Princess
  5555	Mary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next dayâs
  5556	lesson, was about to leave: âMathematics are most important, madam!
  5557	I donât want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and
  5558	youâll like it,â and he patted her cheek. âIt will drive all the
  5559	nonsense out of your head.â
  5560	
  5561	She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
  5562	book from the high desk.
  5563	
  5564	âHere is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your HÃ©loÃ¯se has
  5565	sent you. Religious! I donât interfere with anyoneâs belief... I
  5566	have looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.â
  5567	
  5568	He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.
  5569	
  5570	Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that
  5571	rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She
  5572	sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and
  5573	which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as
  5574	her father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke
  5575	the seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from
  5576	childhood; that same Julie KarÃ¡gina who had been at the RostÃ³vsâ
  5577	name-day party.
  5578	
  5579	Julie wrote in French:
  5580	
  5581	Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is
  5582	separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness
  5583	are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us
  5584	our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against
  5585	fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot
  5586	overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since
  5587	we parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big
  5588	study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as
  5589	three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle,
  5590	calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me
  5591	as I write?
  5592	
  5593	Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror
  5594	which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and
  5595	thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness
  5596	at her reflection in the glass. âShe flatters me,â thought the
  5597	princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter
  5598	her friend, the princessâ eyesâlarge, deep and luminous (it seemed
  5599	as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)âwere
  5600	so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face
  5601	they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the
  5602	princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyesâthe look
  5603	they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her
  5604	face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a
  5605	glass. She went on reading:
  5606	
  5607	All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already
  5608	abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march
  5609	to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought
  5610	intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant
  5611	that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may
  5612	be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His
  5613	goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this
  5614	war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean
  5615	young Nicholas RostÃ³v, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain
  5616	inactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to
  5617	you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for
  5618	the army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you
  5619	last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which
  5620	one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly,
  5621	he is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that
  5622	my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the
  5623	sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.
  5624	Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then.
  5625	That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know
  5626	these poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are
  5627	generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too
  5628	young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship,
  5629	this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of
  5630	this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of
  5631	old Count BezÃºkhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses
  5632	have received very little, Prince VasÃ­li nothing, and it is Monsieur
  5633	Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
  5634	recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count BezÃºkhov and
  5635	possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince
  5636	VasÃ­li played a very despicable part in this affair and that he
  5637	returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.
  5638	
  5639	I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and
  5640	inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used
  5641	to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count BezÃºkhov and the
  5642	owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to
  5643	watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by
  5644	marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward
  5645	him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort
  5646	of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves
  5647	by finding husbands for me (most of whom I donât even know), the
  5648	matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess
  5649	BezÃºkhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post.
  5650	Ã propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal
  5651	auntie Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of
  5652	a plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince
  5653	VasÃ­liâs son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to
  5654	someone rich and distinguÃ©e, and it is on you that his relationsâ
  5655	choice has fallen. I donât know what you will think of it, but
  5656	I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very
  5657	handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find
  5658	out about him.
  5659	
  5660	But enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and
  5661	Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the AprÃ¡ksinsâ. Read the
  5662	mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though
  5663	there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it
  5664	is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give
  5665	my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle
  5666	Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.
  5667	
  5668	JULIE
  5669	
  5670	P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.
  5671	
  5672	The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous
  5673	eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly
  5674	rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of
  5675	paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote,
  5676	also in French:
  5677	
  5678	Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great
  5679	delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which
  5680	you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect
  5681	on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I
  5682	dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if
  5683	we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you
  5684	suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young
  5685	man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such
  5686	feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of
  5687	them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian
  5688	love, love of oneâs neighbor, love of oneâs enemy, is worthier,
  5689	sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a
  5690	young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.
  5691	
  5692	The news of Count BezÃºkhovâs death reached us before your letter
  5693	and my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last
  5694	representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own
  5695	turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
  5696	possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!
  5697	
  5698	I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always
  5699	seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value
  5700	most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince
  5701	VasÃ­li, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine
  5702	Saviourâs words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the
  5703	eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are
  5704	terribly true. I pity Prince VasÃ­li but am still more sorry for Pierre.
  5705	So young, and burdened with such richesâto what temptations he will be
  5706	exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be
  5707	poorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the
  5708	volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since
  5709	you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our
  5710	weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to
  5711	spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear
  5712	no fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for
  5713	confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken
  5714	their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for
  5715	exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read
  5716	the Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries
  5717	they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the
  5718	terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh
  5719	which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us
  5720	rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our
  5721	divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to
  5722	conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less
  5723	we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who
  5724	rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek
  5725	to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will
  5726	He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.
  5727	
  5728	My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he
  5729	has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince VasÃ­li. In
  5730	regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet
  5731	friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must
  5732	conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay
  5733	the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as
  5734	faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings
  5735	toward him whom He may give me for husband.
  5736	
  5737	I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival
  5738	at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one,
  5739	however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war
  5740	into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you
  5741	areâat the heart of affairs and of the worldâis the talk all of
  5742	war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of natureâwhich townsfolk
  5743	consider characteristic of the countryârumors of war are heard
  5744	and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and
  5745	countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day
  5746	before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a
  5747	heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our
  5748	people and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of
  5749	the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should
  5750	have heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the
  5751	laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of
  5752	injuriesâand that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing
  5753	one another.
  5754	
  5755	Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy
  5756	Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!
  5757	
  5758	MARY
  5759	
  5760	âAh, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched
  5761	mine. I have written to my poor mother,â said the smiling Mademoiselle
  5762	Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural râs.
  5763	She brought into Princess Maryâs strenuous, mournful, and gloomy
  5764	world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and
  5765	self-satisfied.
  5766	
  5767	âPrincess, I must warn you,â she added, lowering her voice and
  5768	evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with
  5769	exaggerated grasseyement, âthe prince has been scolding Michael
  5770	IvÃ¡novich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.â
  5771	
  5772	âAh, dear friend,â replied Princess Mary, âI have asked you never
  5773	to warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge
  5774	him and would not have others do so.â
  5775	
  5776	The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes
  5777	late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting
  5778	room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two oâclock, as the
  5779	day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the
  5780	clavichord.
  5781	
  5782	
  5783	
  5784	
  5785	
  5786	CHAPTER XXVI
  5787	
  5788	The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of
  5789	the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house
  5790	through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passagesâtwenty
  5791	times repeatedâof a sonata by Dussek.
  5792	
  5793	Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
  5794	porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to
  5795	alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old TÃ­khon, wearing
  5796	a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in
  5797	a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.
  5798	TÃ­khon knew that neither the sonâs arrival nor any other unusual
  5799	event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince
  5800	Andrew apparently knew this as well as TÃ­khon; he looked at his watch
  5801	as if to ascertain whether his fatherâs habits had changed since he
  5802	was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he
  5803	turned to his wife.
  5804	
  5805	âHe will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Maryâs
  5806	room,â he said.
  5807	
  5808	The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes
  5809	and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as
  5810	merrily and prettily as ever.
  5811	
  5812	âWhy, this is a palace!â she said to her husband, looking around
  5813	with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.
  5814	âLetâs come, quick, quick!â And with a glance round, she smiled at
  5815	TÃ­khon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.
  5816	
  5817	âIs that Mary practicing? Letâs go quietly and take her by
  5818	surprise.â
  5819	
  5820	Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.
  5821	
  5822	âYouâve grown older, TÃ­khon,â he said in passing to the old man,
  5823	who kissed his hand.
  5824	
  5825	Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
  5826	came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,
  5827	rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.
  5828	
  5829	âAh! what joy for the princess!â exclaimed she: âAt last! I must
  5830	let her know.â
  5831	
  5832	âNo, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,â said
  5833	the little princess, kissing her. âI know you already through my
  5834	sister-in-lawâs friendship for you. She was not expecting us?â
  5835	
  5836	They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
  5837	of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and
  5838	made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.
  5839	
  5840	The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the
  5841	middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Maryâs heavy tread and the
  5842	sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who
  5843	had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in
  5844	each otherâs arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they
  5845	happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her
  5846	hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to
  5847	cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as
  5848	lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go
  5849	of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each
  5850	otherâs hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began
  5851	kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrewâs surprise
  5852	both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to
  5853	cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women
  5854	it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never
  5855	entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.
  5856	
  5857	âAh! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...â they suddenly exclaimed, and then
  5858	laughed. âI dreamed last night...âââYou were not expecting
  5859	us?...â âAh! Mary, you have got thinner?...â âAnd you have grown
  5860	stouter!...â
  5861	
  5862	âI knew the princess at once,â put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.
  5863	
  5864	âAnd I had no idea!...â exclaimed Princess Mary. âAh, Andrew, I
  5865	did not see you.â
  5866	
  5867	Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and
  5868	he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had
  5869	turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm,
  5870	gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,
  5871	rested on Prince Andrewâs face.
  5872	
  5873	The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip
  5874	continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary
  5875	and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
  5876	glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had
  5877	had on the SpÃ¡sski Hill which might have been serious for her in her
  5878	condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left
  5879	all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
  5880	to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty
  5881	OdÃ½ntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary,
  5882	a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was
  5883	still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
  5884	of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of
  5885	thought independent of her sister-in-lawâs words. In the midst of a
  5886	description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:
  5887	
  5888	âSo you are really going to the war, Andrew?â she said sighing.
  5889	
  5890	Lise sighed too.
  5891	
  5892	âYes, and even tomorrow,â replied her brother.
  5893	
  5894	âHe is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had
  5895	promotion...â
  5896	
  5897	Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of
  5898	thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.
  5899	
  5900	âIs it certain?â she said.
  5901	
  5902	The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: âYes,
  5903	quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...â
  5904	
  5905	Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-lawâs
  5906	and unexpectedly again began to cry.
  5907	
  5908	âShe needs rest,â said Prince Andrew with a frown. âDonât you,
  5909	Lise? Take her to your room and Iâll go to Father. How is he? Just the
  5910	same?â
  5911	
  5912	âYes, just the same. Though I donât know what your opinion will
  5913	be,â answered the princess joyfully.
  5914	
  5915	âAnd are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the
  5916	lathe?â asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
  5917	showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was
  5918	aware of his weaknesses.
  5919	
  5920	âThe hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and
  5921	my geometry lessons,â said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons
  5922	in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.
  5923	
  5924	When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
  5925	prince to get up, TÃ­khon came to call the young prince to his father.
  5926	The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
  5927	sonâs arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while
  5928	he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned
  5929	style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew
  5930	entered his fatherâs dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and
  5931	manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which
  5932	he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered
  5933	chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to TÃ­khon.
  5934	
  5935	âAh! hereâs the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?â said the
  5936	old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which TÃ­khon
  5937	was holding fast to plait, would allow.
  5938	
  5939	âYou at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like
  5940	this heâll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?â And he
  5941	held out his cheek.
  5942	
  5943	The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He
  5944	used to say that a nap âafter dinner was silverâbefore dinner,
  5945	golden.â) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his
  5946	thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on
  5947	the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his fatherâs favorite
  5948	topicâmaking fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly
  5949	of Bonaparte.
  5950	
  5951	âYes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is
  5952	pregnant,â said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his
  5953	fatherâs face with an eager and respectful look. âHow is your
  5954	health?â
  5955	
  5956	âOnly fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from
  5957	morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.â
  5958	
  5959	âThank God,â said his son smiling.
  5960	
  5961	âGod has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,â he continued,
  5962	returning to his hobby; âtell me how the Germans have taught you to
  5963	fight Bonaparte by this new science you call âstrategy.ââ
  5964	
  5965	Prince Andrew smiled.
  5966	
  5967	âGive me time to collect my wits, Father,â said he, with a smile
  5968	that showed that his fatherâs foibles did not prevent his son from
  5969	loving and honoring him. âWhy, I have not yet had time to settle
  5970	down!â
  5971	
  5972	âNonsense, nonsense!â cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to
  5973	see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. âThe
  5974	house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and
  5975	show her over, and theyâll talk nineteen to the dozen. Thatâs
  5976	their womanâs way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About
  5977	Mikhelsonâs army I understandâTolstÃ³yâs too... a simultaneous
  5978	expedition.... But whatâs the southern army to do? Prussia is
  5979	neutral... I know that. What about Austria?â said he, rising from his
  5980	chair and pacing up and down the room followed by TÃ­khon, who ran after
  5981	him, handing him different articles of clothing. âWhat of Sweden? How
  5982	will they cross Pomerania?â
  5983	
  5984	Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, beganâat first
  5985	reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit
  5986	changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went onâto explain
  5987	the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army,
  5988	ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out
  5989	of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was
  5990	to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty
  5991	thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in
  5992	Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English
  5993	were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand
  5994	men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did
  5995	not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were
  5996	not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three
  5997	times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: âThe
  5998	white one, the white one!â
  5999	
  6000	This meant that TÃ­khon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.
  6001	Another time he interrupted, saying:
  6002	
  6003	âAnd will she soon be confined?â and shaking his head reproachfully
  6004	said: âThatâs bad! Go on, go on.â
  6005	
  6006	The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his
  6007	description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:
  6008	âMalbrook sâen va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.â *
  6009	
  6010	     * âMarlborough is going to the wars; God knows when heâll
  6011	     return.â
  6012	
  6013	
  6014	His son only smiled.
  6015	
  6016	âI donât say itâs a plan I approve of,â said the son; âI am
  6017	only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,
  6018	not worse than this one.â
  6019	
  6020	âWell, youâve told me nothing new,â and the old man repeated,
  6021	meditatively and rapidly:
  6022	
  6023	âDieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.â
  6024	
  6025	
  6026	
  6027	
  6028	
  6029	CHAPTER XXVII
  6030	
  6031	At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the
  6032	dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle
  6033	Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by
  6034	a strange caprice of his employerâs was admitted to table though the
  6035	position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly
  6036	not have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept
  6037	very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important
  6038	government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael
  6039	IvÃ¡novich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his
  6040	checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals,
  6041	and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael IvÃ¡novich
  6042	was ânot a whit worse than you or I.â At dinner the prince usually
  6043	spoke to the taciturn Michael IvÃ¡novich more often than to anyone else.
  6044	
  6045	In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was
  6046	exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmenâone
  6047	behind each chairâstood waiting for the prince to enter. The head
  6048	butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making
  6049	signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door
  6050	by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large
  6051	gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes
  6052	BolkÃ³nski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted
  6053	portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate)
  6054	of a ruling prince, in a crownâan alleged descendant of RÃºrik and
  6055	ancestor of the BolkÃ³nskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that
  6056	genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at
  6057	a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.
  6058	
  6059	âHow thoroughly like him that is!â he said to Princess Mary, who had
  6060	come up to him.
  6061	
  6062	Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand
  6063	what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with
  6064	reverence and was beyond question.
  6065	
  6066	âEveryone has his Achillesâ heel,â continued Prince Andrew.
  6067	âFancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!â
  6068	
  6069	Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brotherâs
  6070	criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard
  6071	coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
  6072	his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
  6073	with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock
  6074	struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing
  6075	room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under
  6076	their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on
  6077	the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the
  6078	sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around
  6079	him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of
  6080	her neck.
  6081	
  6082	âIâm glad, glad, to see you,â he said, looking attentively into
  6083	her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. âSit down,
  6084	sit down! Sit down, Michael IvÃ¡novich!â
  6085	
  6086	He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved
  6087	the chair for her.
  6088	
  6089	âHo, ho!â said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.
  6090	âYouâve been in a hurry. Thatâs bad!â
  6091	
  6092	He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only
  6093	and not with his eyes.
  6094	
  6095	âYou must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,â he
  6096	said.
  6097	
  6098	The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was
  6099	silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and
  6100	she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and
  6101	she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings
  6102	from various people and retelling the town gossip.
  6103	
  6104	âCountess AprÃ¡ksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has
  6105	cried her eyes out,â she said, growing more and more lively.
  6106	
  6107	As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly,
  6108	and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a
  6109	definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael IvÃ¡novich.
  6110	
  6111	âWell, Michael IvÃ¡novich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time
  6112	of it. Prince Andrewâ (he always spoke thus of his son) âhas been
  6113	telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I
  6114	never thought much of him.â
  6115	
  6116	Michael IvÃ¡novich did not at all know when âyou and Iâ had said
  6117	such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as
  6118	a peg on which to hang the princeâs favorite topic, he looked
  6119	inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.
  6120	
  6121	âHe is a great tactician!â said the prince to his son, pointing to
  6122	the architect.
  6123	
  6124	And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the
  6125	generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not
  6126	only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the
  6127	A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant
  6128	little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any
  6129	PotÃ«mkins or SuvÃ³rovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced
  6130	that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war,
  6131	but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing,
  6132	pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his
  6133	fatherâs ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him
  6134	with evident pleasure.
  6135	
  6136	âThe past always seems good,â said he, âbut did not SuvÃ³rov
  6137	himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know
  6138	how to escape?â
  6139	
  6140	âWho told you that? Who?â cried the prince. âSuvÃ³rov!â And he
  6141	jerked away his plate, which TÃ­khon briskly caught. âSuvÃ³rov!...
  6142	Consider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and SuvÃ³rov; Moreau!...
  6143	Moreau would have been a prisoner if SuvÃ³rov had had a free hand; but
  6144	he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have
  6145	puzzled the devil himself! When you get there youâll find out what
  6146	those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! SuvÃ³rov couldnât manage them so
  6147	what chance has Michael KutÃºzov? No, my dear boy,â he continued,
  6148	âyou and your generals wonât get on against Buonaparte; youâll
  6149	have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight
  6150	together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to
  6151	fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,â he said, alluding to the invitation made
  6152	that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... âWonderful!...
  6153	Were the PotÃ«mkins, SuvÃ³rovs, and OrlÃ³vs Germans? No, lad, either you
  6154	fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help
  6155	you, but weâll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great
  6156	commander among them! Hm!...â
  6157	
  6158	âI donât at all say that all the plans are good,â said Prince
  6159	Andrew, âI am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You
  6160	may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great
  6161	general!â
  6162	
  6163	âMichael IvÃ¡novich!â cried the old prince to the architect who,
  6164	busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: âDidnât
  6165	I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same
  6166	thing.â
  6167	
  6168	âTo be sure, your excellency,â replied the architect.
  6169	
  6170	The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.
  6171	
  6172	âBuonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got
  6173	splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only
  6174	idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody
  6175	has beaten the Germans. They beat no oneâexcept one another. He made
  6176	his reputation fighting them.â
  6177	
  6178	And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to
  6179	him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His
  6180	son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were
  6181	presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He
  6182	listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this
  6183	old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and
  6184	discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and
  6185	political events.
  6186	
  6187	âYou think Iâm an old man and donât understand the present state
  6188	of affairs?â concluded his father. âBut it troubles me. I donât
  6189	sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown
  6190	his skill?â he concluded.
  6191	
  6192	âThat would take too long to tell,â answered the son.
  6193	
  6194	âWell, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne,
  6195	hereâs another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,â he
  6196	exclaimed in excellent French.
  6197	
  6198	âYou know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!â
  6199	
  6200	âDieu sait quand reviendra.â hummed the prince out of tune and, with
  6201	a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.
  6202	
  6203	The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of
  6204	the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her
  6205	father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she
  6206	took her sister-in-lawâs arm and drew her into another room.
  6207	
  6208	âWhat a clever man your father is,â said she; âperhaps that is why
  6209	I am afraid of him.â
  6210	
  6211	âOh, he is so kind!â answered Princess Mary.
  6212	
  6213	
  6214	
  6215	
  6216	
  6217	CHAPTER XXVIII
  6218	
  6219	Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering
  6220	his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in
  6221	her sister-in-lawâs room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without
  6222	epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him.
  6223	After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he
  6224	ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept
  6225	with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted
  6226	with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saberâa present from
  6227	his father who had brought it from the siege of OchÃ¡kov. All these
  6228	traveling effects of Prince Andrewâs were in very good order: new,
  6229	clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.
  6230	
  6231	When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable
  6232	of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments
  6233	one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrewâs face
  6234	looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced
  6235	briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him
  6236	and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was
  6237	he sad at leaving his wife?âperhaps both, but evidently he did not
  6238	wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he
  6239	hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the
  6240	cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable
  6241	expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.
  6242	
  6243	âI hear you have given orders to harness,â she cried, panting (she
  6244	had apparently been running), âand I did so wish to have another talk
  6245	with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not
  6246	angry with me for coming? You have changed so, AndrÃºsha,â she added,
  6247	as if to explain such a question.
  6248	
  6249	She smiled as she uttered his pet name, âAndrÃºsha.â It was
  6250	obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be
  6251	AndrÃºshaâthe slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in
  6252	childhood.
  6253	
  6254	âAnd where is Lise?â he asked, answering her question only by a
  6255	smile.
  6256	
  6257	âShe was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.
  6258	Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,â said she, sitting
  6259	down on the sofa, facing her brother. âShe is quite a child: such a
  6260	dear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.â
  6261	
  6262	Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and
  6263	contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.
  6264	
  6265	âOne must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,
  6266	Andrew? Donât forget that she has grown up and been educated in
  6267	society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into
  6268	everyoneâs situation. Tout comprendre, câest tout pardonner. * Think
  6269	what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,
  6270	to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her
  6271	condition! Itâs very hard.â
  6272	
  6273	     * To understand all is to forgive all.
  6274	
  6275	Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we
  6276	think we thoroughly understand.
  6277	
  6278	âYou live in the country and donât think the life terrible,â he
  6279	replied.
  6280	
  6281	âI... thatâs different. Why speak of me? I donât want any other
  6282	life, and canât, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young
  6283	society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her
  6284	life, all aloneâfor Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what
  6285	poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.
  6286	There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....â
  6287	
  6288	âI donât like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,â said Prince
  6289	Andrew.
  6290	
  6291	âNo? She is very nice and kind and, above all, sheâs much to be
  6292	pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I donât need her,
  6293	and sheâs even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am
  6294	even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and
  6295	Michael IvÃ¡novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and
  6296	kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says:
  6297	âWe donât love people so much for the good they have done us, as
  6298	for the good we have done them.â Father took her when she was homeless
  6299	after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father
  6300	likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads
  6301	splendidly.â
  6302	
  6303	âTo be quite frank, Mary, I expect Fatherâs character sometimes
  6304	makes things trying for you, doesnât it?â Prince Andrew asked
  6305	suddenly.
  6306	
  6307	Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.
  6308	
  6309	âFor me? For me?... Trying for me!...â said she.
  6310	
  6311	âHe always was rather harsh; and now I should think heâs getting
  6312	very trying,â said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their
  6313	father in order to puzzle or test his sister.
  6314	
  6315	âYou are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of
  6316	intellectual pride,â said the princess, following the train of her own
  6317	thoughts rather than the trend of the conversationââand thatâs a
  6318	great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling
  6319	except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so
  6320	contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I
  6321	am.â
  6322	
  6323	Her brother shook his head incredulously.
  6324	
  6325	âThe only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,
  6326	Andrew... is Fatherâs way of treating religious subjects. I donât
  6327	understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is
  6328	as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing
  6329	that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of
  6330	improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a
  6331	monk he received and had a long talk with.â
  6332	
  6333	âAh! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your
  6334	powder,â said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.
  6335	
  6336	âAh! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.
  6337	Andrew...â she said timidly after a momentâs silence, âI have a
  6338	great favor to ask of you.â
  6339	
  6340	âWhat is it, dear?â
  6341	
  6342	âNoâpromise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble
  6343	and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,
  6344	AndrÃºsha!...â said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
  6345	taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were
  6346	the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was
  6347	granted.
  6348	
  6349	She looked timidly at her brother.
  6350	
  6351	âEven if it were a great deal of trouble...â answered Prince Andrew,
  6352	as if guessing what it was about.
  6353	
  6354	âThink what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as
  6355	you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Fatherâs father, our
  6356	grandfather, wore it in all his wars.â (She still did not take out
  6357	what she was holding in her reticule.) âSo you promise?â
  6358	
  6359	âOf course. What is it?â
  6360	
  6361	âAndrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
  6362	never take it off. Do you promise?â
  6363	
  6364	âIf it does not weigh a hundredweight and wonât break my neck...
  6365	To please you...â said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing
  6366	the pained expression his joke had brought to his sisterâs face, he
  6367	repented and added: âI am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.â
  6368	
  6369	âAgainst your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you
  6370	to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,â said she in a voice
  6371	trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her
  6372	brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold
  6373	setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.
  6374	
  6375	She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.
  6376	
  6377	âPlease, Andrew, for my sake!...â
  6378	
  6379	Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit
  6380	up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother
  6381	would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood,
  6382	crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for
  6383	he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.
  6384	
  6385	âThank you, my dear.â She kissed him on the forehead and sat down
  6386	again on the sofa. They were silent for a while.
  6387	
  6388	âAs I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always
  6389	used to be. Donât judge Lise harshly,â she began. âShe is so
  6390	sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.â
  6391	
  6392	âI do not think I have complained of my wife to you, MÃ¡sha, or blamed
  6393	her. Why do you say all this to me?â
  6394	
  6395	Red patches appeared on Princess Maryâs face and she was silent as if
  6396	she felt guilty.
  6397	
  6398	âI have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And
  6399	I am sorry for that,â he went on.
  6400	
  6401	The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to
  6402	say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little
  6403	princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings
  6404	about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her
  6405	fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen
  6406	asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.
  6407	
  6408	âKnow this, MÃ¡sha: I canât reproach, have not reproached, and never
  6409	shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself
  6410	with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever
  6411	circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if
  6412	you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this
  6413	is so I donât know...â
  6414	
  6415	As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed
  6416	her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and
  6417	unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over
  6418	her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.
  6419	
  6420	âLet us go to her, I must say good-by. Orâgo and wake and Iâll
  6421	come in a moment. PetrÃºshka!â he called to his valet: âCome here,
  6422	take these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.â
  6423	
  6424	Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:
  6425	âAndrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him
  6426	to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been
  6427	answered.â
  6428	
  6429	âWell, maybe!â said Prince Andrew. âGo, MÃ¡sha; Iâll come
  6430	immediately.â
  6431	
  6432	On the way to his sisterâs room, in the passage which connected one
  6433	wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling
  6434	sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and
  6435	artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.
  6436	
  6437	âOh! I thought you were in your room,â she said, for some reason
  6438	blushing and dropping her eyes.
  6439	
  6440	Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly
  6441	came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
  6442	and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the
  6443	Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his
  6444	sisterâs room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying
  6445	one word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as
  6446	usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make
  6447	up for lost time.
  6448	
  6449	âNo, but imagine the old Countess ZÃºbova, with false curls and her
  6450	mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age....
  6451	Ha, ha, ha! Mary!â
  6452	
  6453	This very sentence about Countess ZÃºbova and this same laugh Prince
  6454	Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some
  6455	five times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and
  6456	rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking
  6457	incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince
  6458	Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after
  6459	their journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.
  6460	
  6461	The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn
  6462	night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.
  6463	Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense
  6464	house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The
  6465	domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to
  6466	the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the
  6467	reception hall: Michael IvÃ¡novich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess
  6468	Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his
  6469	fatherâs study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All
  6470	were waiting for them to come out.
  6471	
  6472	When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age
  6473	spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his
  6474	son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.
  6475	
  6476	âGoing?â And he went on writing.
  6477	
  6478	âIâve come to say good-by.â
  6479	
  6480	âKiss me here,â and he touched his cheek: âThanks, thanks!â
  6481	
  6482	âWhat do you thank me for?â
  6483	
  6484	âFor not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a womanâs apron strings.
  6485	The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!â And he went on
  6486	writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. âIf you have
  6487	anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,â he
  6488	added.
  6489	
  6490	âAbout my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your
  6491	hands....â
  6492	
  6493	âWhy talk nonsense? Say what you want.â
  6494	
  6495	âWhen her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let
  6496	him be here....â
  6497	
  6498	The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his
  6499	stern eyes on his son.
  6500	
  6501	âI know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,â said
  6502	Prince Andrew, evidently confused. âI know that out of a million
  6503	cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been
  6504	telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.â
  6505	
  6506	âHm... Hm...â muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he
  6507	was writing. âIâll do it.â
  6508	
  6509	He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
  6510	laugh.
  6511	
  6512	âItâs a bad business, eh?â
  6513	
  6514	âWhat is bad, Father?â
  6515	
  6516	âThe wife!â said the old prince, briefly and significantly.
  6517	
  6518	âI donât understand!â said Prince Andrew.
  6519	
  6520	âNo, it canât be helped, lad,â said the prince. âTheyâre
  6521	all like that; one canât unmarry. Donât be afraid; I wonât tell
  6522	anyone, but you know it yourself.â
  6523	
  6524	He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked
  6525	straight into his sonâs face with keen eyes which seemed to see
  6526	through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.
  6527	
  6528	The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The
  6529	old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing
  6530	down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.
  6531	
  6532	âWhatâs to be done? Sheâs pretty! I will do everything. Make your
  6533	mind easy,â said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.
  6534	
  6535	Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father
  6536	understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.
  6537	
  6538	âListen!â said he; âdonât worry about your wife: what can be
  6539	done shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael IlariÃ³novich. *
  6540	I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not
  6541	keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember
  6542	and like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all
  6543	rightâserve him. Nicholas BolkÃ³nskiâs son need not serve under
  6544	anyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.â
  6545	
  6546	     *KutÃºzov.
  6547	
  6548	He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son
  6549	was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the
  6550	lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his
  6551	bold, tall, close handwriting.
  6552	
  6553	âI shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;
  6554	hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond
  6555	and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of
  6556	SuvÃ³rovâs wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for
  6557	you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.â
  6558	
  6559	Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time
  6560	yet. He felt that he must not say it.
  6561	
  6562	âI will do it all, Father,â he said.
  6563	
  6564	âWell, now, good-by!â He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced
  6565	him. âRemember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me,
  6566	your old father...â he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous
  6567	voice suddenly shrieked: âbut if I hear that you have not behaved like
  6568	a son of Nicholas BolkÃ³nski, I shall be ashamed!â
  6569	
  6570	âYou need not have said that to me, Father,â said the son with a
  6571	smile.
  6572	
  6573	The old man was silent.
  6574	
  6575	âI also wanted to ask you,â continued Prince Andrew, âif Iâm
  6576	killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from youâas I
  6577	said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.â
  6578	
  6579	âNot let the wife have him?â said the old man, and laughed.
  6580	
  6581	They stood silent, facing one another. The old manâs sharp eyes were
  6582	fixed straight on his sonâs. Something twitched in the lower part of
  6583	the old princeâs face.
  6584	
  6585	âWeâve said good-by. Go!â he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry
  6586	voice, opening his door.
  6587	
  6588	âWhat is it? What?â asked both princesses when they saw for a moment
  6589	at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white
  6590	dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.
  6591	
  6592	Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.
  6593	
  6594	âWell!â he said, turning to his wife.
  6595	
  6596	And this âWell!â sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: âNow
  6597	go through your performance.â
  6598	
  6599	âAndrew, already!â said the little princess, turning pale and
  6600	looking with dismay at her husband.
  6601	
  6602	He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.
  6603	
  6604	He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,
  6605	and carefully placed her in an easy chair.
  6606	
  6607	âAdieu, Mary,â said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand
  6608	and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.
  6609	
  6610	The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing
  6611	her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked
  6612	with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince
  6613	Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From
  6614	the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man
  6615	angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study
  6616	door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
  6617	dressing gown looked out.
  6618	
  6619	âGone? Thatâs all right!â said he; and looking angrily at the
  6620	unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed
  6621	the door.

  6633	CHAPTER I
  6634	
  6635	In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of
  6636	the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from
  6637	Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the
  6638	inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of
  6639	the commander in chief, KutÃºzov.
  6640	
  6641	On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached
  6642	Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected
  6643	by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the
  6644	locality and surroundingsâfruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs,
  6645	and hills in the distanceâand despite the fact that the inhabitants
  6646	(who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the
  6647	regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for
  6648	an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.
  6649	
  6650	On the evening of the last dayâs march an order had been received that
  6651	the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though
  6652	the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and
  6653	the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
  6654	not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
  6655	to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is
  6656	always better to âbow too low than not bow low enough.â So the
  6657	soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all
  6658	night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and
  6659	company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the
  6660	regimentâinstead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on
  6661	its last march the day beforeâpresented a well-ordered array of two
  6662	thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button
  6663	and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only
  6664	externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief
  6665	to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean
  6666	shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, âawl,
  6667	soap, and all,â as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance
  6668	concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the
  6669	soldiersâ boots. More than half the menâs boots were in holes. But
  6670	this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for
  6671	in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian
  6672	commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.
  6673	
  6674	The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and
  6675	thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from
  6676	chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform
  6677	showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
  6678	which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He
  6679	had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of
  6680	his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled
  6681	himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander
  6682	admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was
  6683	engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military
  6684	matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his
  6685	thoughts.
  6686	
  6687	âWell, Michael MÃ­trich, sir?â he said, addressing one of the
  6688	battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that
  6689	they both felt happy). âWe had our hands full last night. However, I
  6690	think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?â
  6691	
  6692	The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.
  6693	
  6694	âIt would not be turned off the field even on the TsarÃ­tsin
  6695	Meadow.â
  6696	
  6697	âWhat?â asked the commander.
  6698	
  6699	At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been
  6700	posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp
  6701	followed by a Cossack.
  6702	
  6703	The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
  6704	clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief
  6705	wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on
  6706	the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation
  6707	whatever.
  6708	
  6709	A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to KutÃºzov the day
  6710	before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of
  6711	the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and KutÃºzov, not considering this
  6712	junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view,
  6713	to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops
  6714	arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment;
  6715	so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander
  6716	in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these
  6717	circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the
  6718	men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the
  6719	commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the
  6720	regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and
  6721	spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.
  6722	
  6723	âA fine mess weâve made of it!â he remarked.
  6724	
  6725	âThere now! Didnât I tell you, Michael MÃ­trich, that if it was said
  6726	âon the marchâ it meant in greatcoats?â said he reproachfully to
  6727	the battalion commander. âOh, my God!â he added, stepping resolutely
  6728	forward. âCompany commanders!â he shouted in a voice accustomed to
  6729	command. âSergeants major!... How soon will he be here?â he asked
  6730	the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the
  6731	personage he was referring to.
  6732	
  6733	âIn an hourâs time, I should say.â
  6734	
  6735	âShall we have time to change clothes?â
  6736	
  6737	âI donât know, General....â
  6738	
  6739	The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the
  6740	soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off
  6741	to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats
  6742	were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up
  6743	to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and
  6744	hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing
  6745	up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps
  6746	over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on
  6747	with upraised arms.
  6748	
  6749	In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray
  6750	instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps
  6751	to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.
  6752	
  6753	âWhatever is this? This!â he shouted and stood still. âCommander
  6754	of the third company!â
  6755	
  6756	âCommander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to
  6757	the general... third company to the commander.â The words passed along
  6758	the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.
  6759	
  6760	When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in
  6761	a cry of: âThe general to the third company,â the missing officer
  6762	appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man
  6763	and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his
  6764	toes toward the general. The captainâs face showed the uneasiness of
  6765	a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots
  6766	appeared on his nose, the redness of which was evidently due to
  6767	intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The general looked the
  6768	captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he
  6769	approached.
  6770	
  6771	âYou will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?â
  6772	shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
  6773	at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish
  6774	cloth, which contrasted with the others. âWhat have you been after?
  6775	The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? Iâll
  6776	teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?â
  6777	
  6778	The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,
  6779	pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this
  6780	pressure lay his only hope of salvation.
  6781	
  6782	âWell, why donât you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a
  6783	Hungarian?â said the commander with an austere gibe.
  6784	
  6785	âYour excellency...â
  6786	
  6787	âWell, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your
  6788	excellency?... nobody knows.â
  6789	
  6790	âYour excellency, itâs the officer DÃ³lokhov, who has been reduced
  6791	to the ranks,â said the captain softly.
  6792	
  6793	âWell? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?
  6794	If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the
  6795	others.â
  6796	
  6797	âYour excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.â
  6798	
  6799	âGave him leave? Leave? Thatâs just like you young men,â said the
  6800	regimental commander cooling down a little. âLeave indeed.... One says
  6801	a word to you and you... What?â he added with renewed irritation, âI
  6802	beg you to dress your men decently.â
  6803	
  6804	And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky
  6805	steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display of
  6806	anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for
  6807	wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another
  6808	because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.
  6809	
  6810	âH-o-o-w are you standing? Whereâs your leg? Your leg?â shouted
  6811	the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were
  6812	still five men between him and DÃ³lokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.
  6813	
  6814	DÃ³lokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his
  6815	clear, insolent eyes in the generalâs face.
  6816	
  6817	âWhy a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat...
  6818	the ras...â he did not finish.
  6819	
  6820	âGeneral, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...â
  6821	DÃ³lokhov hurriedly interrupted.
  6822	
  6823	âNo talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!â
  6824	
  6825	âNot bound to endure insults,â DÃ³lokhov concluded in loud, ringing
  6826	tones.
  6827	
  6828	The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became silent,
  6829	angrily pulling down his tight scarf.
  6830	
  6831	âI request you to have the goodness to change your coat,â he said as
  6832	he turned away.
  6833	
  6834	
  6835	
  6836	
  6837	
  6838	CHAPTER II
  6839	
  6840	âHeâs coming!â shouted the signaler at that moment.
  6841	
  6842	The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup
  6843	with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,
  6844	drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening
  6845	his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird
  6846	preening its plumage and became motionless.
  6847	
  6848	âAtt-ention!â shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking
  6849	voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and
  6850	welcome for the approaching chief.
  6851	
  6852	Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high,
  6853	light blue Viennese calÃ¨che, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn
  6854	by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the calÃ¨che galloped the suite
  6855	and a convoy of Croats. Beside KutÃºzov sat an Austrian general, in
  6856	a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. The
  6857	calÃ¨che stopped in front of the regiment. KutÃºzov and the Austrian
  6858	general were talking in low voices and KutÃºzov smiled slightly as
  6859	treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two
  6860	thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did
  6861	not exist.
  6862	
  6863	The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a
  6864	jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the
  6865	feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared,
  6866	âHealth to your ex... len... len... lency!â and again all became
  6867	silent. At first KutÃºzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he
  6868	and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the
  6869	ranks.
  6870	
  6871	From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and
  6872	devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from
  6873	the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward
  6874	and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he
  6875	darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief,
  6876	it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
  6877	greater zeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and
  6878	assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that
  6879	had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There
  6880	were only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except
  6881	the boots.
  6882	
  6883	KutÃºzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few
  6884	friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes
  6885	also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his
  6886	head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression
  6887	which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help
  6888	noticing what a bad state of things it was. The regimental commander
  6889	ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the
  6890	commander in chiefâs regarding the regiment. Behind KutÃºzov, at a
  6891	distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed
  6892	some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves
  6893	and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked
  6894	a handsome adjutant. This was Prince BolkÃ³nski. Beside him was his
  6895	comrade NesvÃ­tski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a
  6896	kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. NesvÃ­tski could hardly
  6897	keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked
  6898	beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a
  6899	change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental
  6900	commanderâs back and mimicked his every movement. Each time the
  6901	commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward
  6902	in exactly the same manner. NesvÃ­tski laughed and nudged the others to
  6903	make them look at the wag.
  6904	
  6905	KutÃºzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were
  6906	starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the
  6907	third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this,
  6908	involuntarily came closer to him.
  6909	
  6910	âAh, TimÃ³khin!â said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had
  6911	been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.
  6912	
  6913	One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself
  6914	more than TimÃ³khin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
  6915	commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew
  6916	himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained
  6917	it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so KutÃºzov,
  6918	who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good,
  6919	quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his
  6920	scarred and puffy face.
  6921	
  6922	âAnother Ismail comrade,â said he. âA brave officer! Are you
  6923	satisfied with him?â he asked the regimental commander.
  6924	
  6925	And the latterâunconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar
  6926	officer as in a looking glassâstarted, moved forward, and answered:
  6927	âHighly satisfied, your excellency!â
  6928	
  6929	âWe all have our weaknesses,â said KutÃºzov smiling and walking away
  6930	from him. âHe used to have a predilection for Bacchus.â
  6931	
  6932	The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did
  6933	not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed
  6934	captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose
  6935	with such exactitude that NesvÃ­tski could not help laughing. KutÃºzov
  6936	turned round. The officer evidently had complete control of his face,
  6937	and while KutÃºzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume
  6938	a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.
  6939	
  6940	The third company was the last, and KutÃºzov pondered, apparently trying
  6941	to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the
  6942	suite and said in French:
  6943	
  6944	âYou told me to remind you of the officer DÃ³lokhov, reduced to the
  6945	ranks in this regiment.â
  6946	
  6947	âWhere is DÃ³lokhov?â asked KutÃºzov.
  6948	
  6949	DÃ³lokhov, who had already changed into a soldierâs gray greatcoat,
  6950	did not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired
  6951	soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went
  6952	up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.
  6953	
  6954	âHave you a complaint to make?â KutÃºzov asked with a slight frown.
  6955	
  6956	âThis is DÃ³lokhov,â said Prince Andrew.
  6957	
  6958	âAh!â said KutÃºzov. âI hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your
  6959	duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shanât forget you if you deserve
  6960	well.â
  6961	
  6962	The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as
  6963	they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression
  6964	to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief
  6965	so widely from a private.
  6966	
  6967	âOne thing I ask of your excellency,â DÃ³lokhov said in his firm,
  6968	ringing, deliberate voice. âI ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
  6969	and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!â
  6970	
  6971	KutÃºzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had
  6972	turned from Captain TimÃ³khin again flitted over his face. He turned
  6973	away with a grimace as if to say that everything DÃ³lokhov had said to
  6974	him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was
  6975	weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and
  6976	went to the carriage.
  6977	
  6978	The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed
  6979	quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and
  6980	to rest after their hard marches.
  6981	
  6982	âYou wonât bear me a grudge, ProkhÃ³r IgnÃ¡tych?â said the
  6983	regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its
  6984	quarters and riding up to Captain TimÃ³khin who was walking in front.
  6985	(The regimental commanderâs face now that the inspection was happily
  6986	over beamed with irrepressible delight.) âItâs in the Emperorâs
  6987	service... it canât be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on
  6988	parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very
  6989	pleased!â And he held out his hand to the captain.
  6990	
  6991	âDonât mention it, General, as if Iâd be so bold!â replied the
  6992	captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where
  6993	two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end
  6994	of a gun at Ismail.
  6995	
  6996	âAnd tell Mr. DÃ³lokhov that I wonât forget himâhe may be quite
  6997	easy. And tell me, pleaseâIâve been meaning to askâhow is he
  6998	behaving himself, and in general...â
  6999	
  7000	âAs far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency;
  7001	but his character...â said TimÃ³khin.
  7002	
  7003	âAnd what about his character?â asked the regimental commander.
  7004	
  7005	âItâs different on different days,â answered the captain. âOne
  7006	day he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next heâs
  7007	a wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.â
  7008	
  7009	âOh, well, well!â remarked the regimental commander. âStill, one
  7010	must have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important
  7011	connections... Well, then, you just...â
  7012	
  7013	âI will, your excellency,â said TimÃ³khin, showing by his smile that
  7014	he understood his commanderâs wish.
  7015	
  7016	âWell, of course, of course!â
  7017	
  7018	The regimental commander sought out DÃ³lokhov in the ranks and, reining
  7019	in his horse, said to him:
  7020	
  7021	âAfter the next affair... epaulettes.â
  7022	
  7023	DÃ³lokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking
  7024	smile on his lips change.
  7025	
  7026	âWell, thatâs all right,â continued the regimental commander. âA
  7027	cup of vodka for the men from me,â he added so that the soldiers
  7028	could hear. âI thank you all! God be praised!â and he rode past that
  7029	company and overtook the next one.
  7030	
  7031	âWell, heâs really a good fellow, one can serve under him,â said
  7032	TimÃ³khin to the subaltern beside him.
  7033	
  7034	âIn a word, a hearty one...â said the subaltern, laughing (the
  7035	regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).
  7036	
  7037	The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
  7038	soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiersâ voices could be
  7039	heard on every side.
  7040	
  7041	âAnd they said KutÃºzov was blind of one eye?â
  7042	
  7043	âAnd so he is! Quite blind!â
  7044	
  7045	âNo, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands...
  7046	he noticed everything...â
  7047	
  7048	âWhen he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...â
  7049	
  7050	âAnd that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were
  7051	smeared with chalkâas white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as
  7052	they do the guns.â
  7053	
  7054	âI say, FÃ©deshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You
  7055	were near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.â
  7056	
  7057	âBuonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesnât
  7058	know! The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are
  7059	putting them down. When theyâve been put down, the war with Buonaparte
  7060	will begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows youâre a fool.
  7061	Youâd better listen more carefully!â
  7062	
  7063	âWhat devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is
  7064	turning into the village already... they will have their buckwheat
  7065	cooked before we reach our quarters.â
  7066	
  7067	âGive me a biscuit, you devil!â
  7068	
  7069	âAnd did you give me tobacco yesterday? Thatâs just it, friend! Ah,
  7070	well, never mind, here you are.â
  7071	
  7072	âThey might call a halt here or weâll have to do another four miles
  7073	without eating.â
  7074	
  7075	âWasnât it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still
  7076	and are drawn along.â
  7077	
  7078	âAnd here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all
  7079	seemed to be Polesâall under the Russian crownâbut here theyâre
  7080	all regular Germans.â
  7081	
  7082	âSingers to the frontâ came the captainâs order.
  7083	
  7084	And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A
  7085	drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing
  7086	his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiersâ song, commencing with the
  7087	words: âMorning dawned, the sun was rising,â and concluding: âOn
  7088	then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father KÃ¡menski.â This song had
  7089	been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the
  7090	only change being that the words âFather KÃ¡menskiâ were replaced by
  7091	âFather KutÃºzov.â
  7092	
  7093	Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms
  7094	as if flinging something to the ground, the drummerâa lean, handsome
  7095	soldier of fortyâlooked sternly at the singers and screwed up his
  7096	eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him,
  7097	he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious
  7098	object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly
  7099	flung it down and began:
  7100	
  7101	âOh, my bower, oh, my bower...!â
  7102	
  7103	âOh, my bower new...!â chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet
  7104	player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front
  7105	and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and
  7106	flourished his castanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers,
  7107	swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long
  7108	steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs,
  7109	and the tramp of horsesâ hoofs were heard. KutÃºzov and his suite were
  7110	returning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the
  7111	men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed
  7112	pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing
  7113	soldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file
  7114	from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company,
  7115	a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was DÃ³lokhov
  7116	marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and
  7117	looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that
  7118	moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of KutÃºzovâs
  7119	suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the
  7120	carriage and rode up to DÃ³lokhov.
  7121	
  7122	Hussar cornet ZherkÃ³v had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to
  7123	the wild set led by DÃ³lokhov. ZherkÃ³v had met DÃ³lokhov abroad as a
  7124	private and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that KutÃºzov had
  7125	spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of
  7126	an old friend.
  7127	
  7128	âMy dear fellow, how are you?â said he through the singing, making
  7129	his horse keep pace with the company.
  7130	
  7131	âHow am I?â DÃ³lokhov answered coldly. âI am as you see.â
  7132	
  7133	The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy
  7134	gaiety with which ZherkÃ³v spoke, and to the intentional coldness of
  7135	DÃ³lokhovâs reply.
  7136	
  7137	âAnd how do you get on with the officers?â inquired ZherkÃ³v.
  7138	
  7139	âAll right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the
  7140	staff?â
  7141	
  7142	âI was attached; Iâm on duty.â
  7143	
  7144	Both were silent.
  7145	
  7146	âShe let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,â went the
  7147	song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.
  7148	Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect
  7149	of that song.
  7150	
  7151	âIs it true that Austrians have been beaten?â asked DÃ³lokhov.
  7152	
  7153	âThe devil only knows! They say so.â
  7154	
  7155	âIâm glad,â answered DÃ³lokhov briefly and clearly, as the song
  7156	demanded.
  7157	
  7158	âI say, come round some evening and weâll have a game of faro!â
  7159	said ZherkÃ³v.
  7160	
  7161	âWhy, have you too much money?â
  7162	
  7163	âDo come.â
  7164	
  7165	âI canât. Iâve sworn not to. I wonât drink and wonât play till
  7166	I get reinstated.â
  7167	
  7168	âWell, thatâs only till the first engagement.â
  7169	
  7170	âWe shall see.â
  7171	
  7172	They were again silent.
  7173	
  7174	âCome if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the
  7175	staff...â
  7176	
  7177	DÃ³lokhov smiled. âDonât trouble. If I want anything, I wonât
  7178	begâIâll take it!â
  7179	
  7180	âWell, never mind; I only...â
  7181	
  7182	âAnd I only...â
  7183	
  7184	âGood-by.â
  7185	
  7186	âGood health...â
  7187	
  7188	        âItâs a long, long way.
  7189	        To my native land...â
  7190	
  7191	
  7192	ZherkÃ³v touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from
  7193	foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped
  7194	past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the
  7195	song.
  7196	
  7197	
  7198	
  7199	
  7200	
  7201	CHAPTER III
  7202	
  7203	On returning from the review, KutÃºzov took the Austrian general into
  7204	his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers
  7205	relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the
  7206	letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of
  7207	the advanced army. Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski came into the room with the
  7208	required papers. KutÃºzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath
  7209	were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.
  7210	
  7211	âAh!...â said KutÃºzov glancing at BolkÃ³nski as if by this
  7212	exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the
  7213	conversation in French.
  7214	
  7215	âAll I can say, General,â said he with a pleasant elegance
  7216	of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each
  7217	deliberately spoken word. It was evident that KutÃºzov himself listened
  7218	with pleasure to his own voice. âAll I can say, General, is that if
  7219	the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the
  7220	Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long
  7221	ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me
  7222	personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command
  7223	of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful
  7224	generalâof whom Austria has so manyâand to lay down all this heavy
  7225	responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us,
  7226	General.â
  7227	
  7228	And KutÃºzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, âYou are quite at
  7229	liberty not to believe me and I donât even care whether you do or
  7230	not, but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole
  7231	point.â
  7232	
  7233	The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply
  7234	in the same tone.
  7235	
  7236	âOn the contrary,â he said, in a querulous and angry tone that
  7237	contrasted with his flattering words, âon the contrary, your
  7238	excellencyâs participation in the common action is highly valued by
  7239	His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
  7240	Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
  7241	accustomed to win in their battles,â he concluded his evidently
  7242	prearranged sentence.
  7243	
  7244	KutÃºzov bowed with the same smile.
  7245	
  7246	âBut that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which
  7247	His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the
  7248	Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General
  7249	Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need
  7250	our aid,â said KutÃºzov.
  7251	
  7252	The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian
  7253	defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors
  7254	that were afloat, and so KutÃºzovâs suggestion of an Austrian victory
  7255	sounded much like irony. But KutÃºzov went on blandly smiling with the
  7256	same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose
  7257	so. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mackâs army
  7258	informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the
  7259	army was very favorable.
  7260	
  7261	âGive me that letter,â said KutÃºzov turning to Prince Andrew.
  7262	âPlease have a look at itââand KutÃºzov with an ironical smile
  7263	about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the
  7264	following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinandâs letter:
  7265	
  7266	We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
  7267	which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also,
  7268	as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of
  7269	commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not
  7270	cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line
  7271	of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his
  7272	intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
  7273	ally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial
  7274	Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with
  7275	it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.
  7276	
  7277	KutÃºzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the
  7278	member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.
  7279	
  7280	âBut you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect
  7281	the worst,â said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done
  7282	with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the
  7283	aide-de-camp.
  7284	
  7285	âExcuse me, General,â interrupted KutÃºzov, also turning to Prince
  7286	Andrew. âLook here, my dear fellow, get from KozlÃ³vski all the
  7287	reports from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and
  7288	here is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are
  7289	these,â he said, handing him several papers, âmake a neat memorandum
  7290	in French out of all this, showing all the news we have had of the
  7291	movements of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency.â
  7292	
  7293	Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the
  7294	first not only what had been said but also what KutÃºzov would have
  7295	liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,
  7296	stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.
  7297	
  7298	Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he
  7299	had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face,
  7300	in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former
  7301	affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time
  7302	to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with
  7303	agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction
  7304	with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter
  7305	and more attractive.
  7306	
  7307	KutÃºzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly,
  7308	promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,
  7309	and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions.
  7310	From Vienna KutÃºzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrewâs father.
  7311	
  7312	Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry,
  7313	firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a
  7314	subordinate by me.
  7315	
  7316	On KutÃºzovâs staff, among his fellow officers and in the army
  7317	generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two
  7318	quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be
  7319	different from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things
  7320	of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince
  7321	Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and
  7322	considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people
  7323	Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even
  7324	feared him.
  7325	
  7326	Coming out of KutÃºzovâs room into the waiting room with the papers in
  7327	his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,
  7328	KozlÃ³vski, who was sitting at the window with a book.
  7329	
  7330	âWell, Prince?â asked KozlÃ³vski.
  7331	
  7332	âI am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
  7333	advancing.â
  7334	
  7335	âAnd why is it?â
  7336	
  7337	Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.
  7338	
  7339	âAny news from Mack?â
  7340	
  7341	âNo.â
  7342	
  7343	âIf it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.â
  7344	
  7345	âProbably,â said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.
  7346	
  7347	But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the
  7348	order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head,
  7349	who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door.
  7350	Prince Andrew stopped short.
  7351	
  7352	âCommander in Chief KutÃºzov?â said the newly arrived general
  7353	speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and
  7354	advancing straight toward the inner door.
  7355	
  7356	âThe commander in chief is engaged,â said KozlÃ³vski, going
  7357	hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door.
  7358	âWhom shall I announce?â
  7359	
  7360	The unknown general looked disdainfully down at KozlÃ³vski, who was
  7361	rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.
  7362	
  7363	âThe commander in chief is engaged,â repeated KozlÃ³vski calmly.
  7364	
  7365	The generalâs face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took
  7366	out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the
  7367	leaf, gave it to KozlÃ³vski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw
  7368	himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, âWhy
  7369	do they look at me?â Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as
  7370	if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected
  7371	indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which
  7372	immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened and KutÃºzov
  7373	appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward
  7374	as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides
  7375	with his thin legs, went up to KutÃºzov.
  7376	
  7377	âVous voyez le malheureux Mack,â he uttered in a broken voice.
  7378	
  7379	KutÃºzovâs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
  7380	immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave
  7381	and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully,
  7382	closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed
  7383	the door himself behind him.
  7384	
  7385	The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten
  7386	and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct.
  7387	Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with
  7388	orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been
  7389	inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.
  7390	
  7391	Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest
  7392	lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the
  7393	details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost,
  7394	understood all the difficulties of the Russian armyâs position, and
  7395	vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to
  7396	play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the
  7397	humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a weekâs time he might,
  7398	perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the
  7399	French since SuvÃ³rov met them. He feared that Bonaparteâs genius
  7400	might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same
  7401	time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.
  7402	
  7403	Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his
  7404	room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor
  7405	he met NesvÃ­tski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag ZherkÃ³v;
  7406	they were as usual laughing.
  7407	
  7408	âWhy are you so glum?â asked NesvÃ­tski noticing Prince Andrewâs
  7409	pale face and glittering eyes.
  7410	
  7411	âThereâs nothing to be gay about,â answered BolkÃ³nski.
  7412	
  7413	Just as Prince Andrew met NesvÃ­tski and ZherkÃ³v, there came toward
  7414	them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general
  7415	who was on KutÃºzovâs staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian
  7416	army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous
  7417	evening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to
  7418	pass the three officers quite easily, but ZherkÃ³v, pushing NesvÃ­tski
  7419	aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,
  7420	
  7421	âTheyâre coming!... theyâre coming!... Stand aside, make way,
  7422	please make way!â
  7423	
  7424	The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid
  7425	embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag ZherkÃ³v there suddenly
  7426	appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.
  7427	
  7428	âYour excellency,â said he in German, stepping forward and
  7429	addressing the Austrian general, âI have the honor to congratulate
  7430	you.â
  7431	
  7432	He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the
  7433	other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.
  7434	
  7435	The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the
  7436	seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a momentâs
  7437	attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.
  7438	
  7439	âI have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite
  7440	well, only a little bruised just here,â he added, pointing with a
  7441	beaming smile to his head.
  7442	
  7443	The general frowned, turned away, and went on.
  7444	
  7445	âGott, wie naiv!â * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.
  7446	
  7447	     * âGood God, what simplicity!â
  7448	
  7449	
  7450	NesvÃ­tski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but
  7451	BolkÃ³nski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and
  7452	turned to ZherkÃ³v. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance
  7453	of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the
  7454	Russian army found vent in anger at ZherkÃ³vâs untimely jest.
  7455	
  7456	âIf you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,â he said
  7457	sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, âI canât prevent
  7458	your doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my
  7459	presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.â
  7460	
  7461	NesvÃ­tski and ZherkÃ³v were so surprised by this outburst that they
  7462	gazed at BolkÃ³nski silently with wide-open eyes.
  7463	
  7464	âWhatâs the matter? I only congratulated them,â said ZherkÃ³v.
  7465	
  7466	âI am not jesting with you; please be silent!â cried BolkÃ³nski,
  7467	and taking NesvÃ­tskiâs arm he left ZherkÃ³v, who did not know what to
  7468	say.
  7469	
  7470	âCome, whatâs the matter, old fellow?â said NesvÃ­tski trying to
  7471	soothe him.
  7472	
  7473	âWhatâs the matter?â exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in
  7474	his excitement. âDonât you understand that either we are officers
  7475	serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and
  7476	grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely
  7477	lackeys who care nothing for their masterâs business. Quarante mille
  7478	hommes massacrÃ©s et lâarmÃ©e de nos alliÃ©s dÃ©truite, et vous
  7479	trouvez lÃ  le mot pour rire,â * he said, as if strengthening his
  7480	views by this French sentence. âCâest bien pour un garÃ§on de rien
  7481	comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas
  7482	pour vous. *(2) Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this
  7483	way,â he added in Russianâbut pronouncing the word with a French
  7484	accentâhaving noticed that ZherkÃ³v could still hear him.
  7485	
  7486	     * âForty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies
  7487	     destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!â
  7488	
  7489	     * (2) âIt is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow
  7490	     of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for
  7491	     you.â
  7492	
  7493	
  7494	He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned
  7495	and went out of the corridor.
  7496	
  7497	
  7498	
  7499	
  7500	
  7501	CHAPTER IV
  7502	
  7503	The PÃ¡vlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The
  7504	squadron in which Nicholas RostÃ³v served as a cadet was quartered in
  7505	the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were
  7506	assigned to cavalry-captain DenÃ­sov, the squadron commander, known
  7507	throughout the whole cavalry division as VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov. Cadet RostÃ³v,
  7508	ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the
  7509	squadron commander.
  7510	
  7511	On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news
  7512	of Mackâs defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was
  7513	proceeding as usual. DenÃ­sov, who had been losing at cards all night,
  7514	had not yet come home when RostÃ³v rode back early in the morning from
  7515	a foraging expedition. RostÃ³v in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his
  7516	horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple
  7517	youthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to
  7518	part from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.
  7519	
  7520	âAh, BondarÃ©nko, dear friend!â said he to the hussar who rushed up
  7521	headlong to the horse. âWalk him up and down, my dear fellow,â he
  7522	continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young
  7523	people show to everyone when they are happy.
  7524	
  7525	âYes, your excellency,â answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his
  7526	head.
  7527	
  7528	âMind, walk him up and down well!â
  7529	
  7530	Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but BondarÃ©nko had already
  7531	thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horseâs head. It was
  7532	evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to
  7533	serve him. RostÃ³v patted the horseâs neck and then his flank, and
  7534	lingered for a moment.
  7535	
  7536	âSplendid! What a horse he will be!â he thought with a smile, and
  7537	holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the
  7538	porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in
  7539	hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face
  7540	immediately brightened on seeing RostÃ³v. âSchÃ¶n gut Morgen! SchÃ¶n
  7541	gut Morgen!â * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased
  7542	to greet the young man.
  7543	
  7544	    * âA very good morning! A very good morning!â
  7545	
  7546	
  7547	âSchon fleissig?â * said RostÃ³v with the same gay brotherly smile
  7548	which did not leave his eager face. âHoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen!
  7549	Kaiser Alexander hoch!â *(2) said he, quoting words often repeated by
  7550	the German landlord.
  7551	
  7552	    * âBusy already?â
  7553	
  7554	    * (2) âHurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians!
  7555	     Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!â
  7556	
  7557	
  7558	The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and
  7559	waving it above his head cried:
  7560	
  7561	âUnd die ganze Welt hoch!â *
  7562	
  7563	    * âAnd hurrah for the whole world!â
  7564	
  7565	
  7566	RostÃ³v waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing,
  7567	âUnd vivat die ganze Welt!â Though neither the German cleaning his
  7568	cowshed nor RostÃ³v back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
  7569	reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and
  7570	brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection,
  7571	and parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and RostÃ³v
  7572	going to the cottage he occupied with DenÃ­sov.
  7573	
  7574	âWhat about your master?â he asked LavrÃºshka, DenÃ­sovâs orderly,
  7575	whom all the regiment knew for a rogue.
  7576	
  7577	âHasnât been in since the evening. Must have been losing,â
  7578	answered LavrÃºshka. âI know by now, if he wins he comes back early to
  7579	brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means heâs lost and
  7580	will come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?â
  7581	
  7582	âYes, bring some.â
  7583	
  7584	Ten minutes later LavrÃºshka brought the coffee. âHeâs coming!â
  7585	said he. âNow for trouble!â RostÃ³v looked out of the window and
  7586	saw DenÃ­sov coming home. DenÃ­sov was a small man with a red face,
  7587	sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an
  7588	unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled
  7589	shako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging
  7590	his head.
  7591	
  7592	âLavwÃºska!â he shouted loudly and angrily, âtake it off,
  7593	blockhead!â
  7594	
  7595	âWell, I am taking it off,â replied LavrÃºshkaâs voice.
  7596	
  7597	âAh, youâre up already,â said DenÃ­sov, entering the room.
  7598	
  7599	âLong ago,â answered RostÃ³v, âI have already been for the hay,
  7600	and have seen FrÃ¤ulein Mathilde.â
  7601	
  7602	âWeally! And Iâve been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a
  7603	damned fool!â cried DenÃ­sov, not pronouncing his râs. âSuch ill
  7604	luck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo
  7605	there! Tea!â
  7606	
  7607	Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong
  7608	teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick
  7609	tangled black hair.
  7610	
  7611	âAnd what devil made me go to that wat?â (an officer nicknamed
  7612	âthe ratâ) he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both
  7613	hands. âJust fancy, he didnât let me win a single cahd, not one
  7614	cahd.â
  7615	
  7616	He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his
  7617	fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he
  7618	continued to shout.
  7619	
  7620	âHe lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it;
  7621	gives the singles and snatches the doubles!â
  7622	
  7623	He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away.
  7624	Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully
  7625	with his glittering, black eyes at RostÃ³v.
  7626	
  7627	âIf at least we had some women here; but thereâs nothing foh one
  7628	to do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, whoâs
  7629	there?â he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy
  7630	boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful
  7631	cough.
  7632	
  7633	âThe squadron quartermaster!â said LavrÃºshka.
  7634	
  7635	DenÃ­sovâs face puckered still more.
  7636	
  7637	âWetched!â he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it.
  7638	âWostÃ³v, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the
  7639	purse undah the pillow,â he said, and went out to the quartermaster.
  7640	
  7641	RostÃ³v took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins
  7642	in separate piles, began counting them.
  7643	
  7644	âAh! TelyÃ¡nin! How dâye do? They plucked me last night,â came
  7645	DenÃ­sovâs voice from the next room.
  7646	
  7647	âWhere? At Bykovâs, at the ratâs... I knew it,â replied a piping
  7648	voice, and Lieutenant TelyÃ¡nin, a small officer of the same squadron,
  7649	entered the room.
  7650	
  7651	RostÃ³v thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand
  7652	which was offered him. TelyÃ¡nin for some reason had been transferred
  7653	from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the
  7654	regiment but was not liked; RostÃ³v especially detested him and was
  7655	unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.
  7656	
  7657	âWell, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?â he asked. (Rook
  7658	was a young horse TelyÃ¡nin had sold to RostÃ³v.)
  7659	
  7660	The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the
  7661	face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.
  7662	
  7663	âI saw you riding this morning...â he added.
  7664	
  7665	âOh, heâs all right, a good horse,â answered RostÃ³v, though the
  7666	horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half
  7667	that sum. âHeâs begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,â he
  7668	added.
  7669	
  7670	âThe hoofâs cracked! Thatâs nothing. Iâll teach you what to do
  7671	and show you what kind of rivet to use.â
  7672	
  7673	âYes, please do,â said RostÃ³v.
  7674	
  7675	âIâll show you, Iâll show you! Itâs not a secret. And itâs a
  7676	horse youâll thank me for.â
  7677	
  7678	âThen Iâll have it brought round,â said RostÃ³v wishing to avoid
  7679	TelyÃ¡nin, and he went out to give the order.
  7680	
  7681	In the passage DenÃ­sov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold
  7682	facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing RostÃ³v,
  7683	DenÃ­sov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his
  7684	thumb to the room where TelyÃ¡nin was sitting, he frowned and gave a
  7685	shudder of disgust.
  7686	
  7687	âUgh! I donât like that fellow,â he said, regardless of the
  7688	quartermasterâs presence.
  7689	
  7690	RostÃ³v shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: âNor do I, but
  7691	whatâs one to do?â and, having given his order, he returned to
  7692	TelyÃ¡nin.
  7693	
  7694	TelyÃ¡nin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which RostÃ³v had
  7695	left him, rubbing his small white hands.
  7696	
  7697	âWell there certainly are disgusting people,â thought RostÃ³v as he
  7698	entered.
  7699	
  7700	âHave you told them to bring the horse?â asked TelyÃ¡nin, getting up
  7701	and looking carelessly about him.
  7702	
  7703	âI have.â
  7704	
  7705	âLet us go ourselves. I only came round to ask DenÃ­sov about
  7706	yesterdayâs order. Have you got it, DenÃ­sov?â
  7707	
  7708	âNot yet. But where are you off to?â
  7709	
  7710	âI want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,â said
  7711	TelyÃ¡nin.
  7712	
  7713	They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant
  7714	explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.
  7715	
  7716	When RostÃ³v went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the
  7717	table. DenÃ­sov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of
  7718	paper. He looked gloomily in RostÃ³vâs face and said: âI am witing
  7719	to her.â
  7720	
  7721	He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,
  7722	evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
  7723	write, told RostÃ³v the contents of his letter.
  7724	
  7725	âYou see, my fwiend,â he said, âwe sleep when we donât love. We
  7726	are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one
  7727	is puaâ as on the fihst day of cweation... Whoâs that now? Send him
  7728	to the devil, Iâm busy!â he shouted to LavrÃºshka, who went up to
  7729	him not in the least abashed.
  7730	
  7731	âWho should it be? You yourself told him to come. Itâs the
  7732	quartermaster for the money.â
  7733	
  7734	DenÃ­sov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.
  7735	
  7736	âWetched business,â he muttered to himself. âHow much is left in
  7737	the puhse?â he asked, turning to RostÃ³v.
  7738	
  7739	âSeven new and three old imperials.â
  7740	
  7741	âOh, itâs wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you
  7742	scaâcwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,â he shouted to LavrÃºshka.
  7743	
  7744	âPlease, DenÃ­sov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,â
  7745	said RostÃ³v, blushing.
  7746	
  7747	âDonât like bowwowing from my own fellows, I donât,â growled
  7748	DenÃ­sov.
  7749	
  7750	âBut if you wonât accept money from me like a comrade, you will
  7751	offend me. Really I have some,â RostÃ³v repeated.
  7752	
  7753	âNo, I tell you.â
  7754	
  7755	And DenÃ­sov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.
  7756	
  7757	âWhere have you put it, WostÃ³v?â
  7758	
  7759	âUnder the lower pillow.â
  7760	
  7761	âItâs not there.â
  7762	
  7763	DenÃ­sov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.
  7764	
  7765	âThatâs a miwacle.â
  7766	
  7767	âWait, havenât you dropped it?â said RostÃ³v, picking up the
  7768	pillows one at a time and shaking them.
  7769	
  7770	He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.
  7771	
  7772	âDear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept
  7773	it under your head like a treasure,â said RostÃ³v. âI put it just
  7774	here. Where is it?â he asked, turning to LavrÃºshka.
  7775	
  7776	âI havenât been in the room. It must be where you put it.â
  7777	
  7778	âBut it isnât?...â
  7779	
  7780	âYouâre always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget
  7781	it. Feel in your pockets.â
  7782	
  7783	âNo, if I hadnât thought of it being a treasure,â said RostÃ³v,
  7784	âbut I remember putting it there.â
  7785	
  7786	LavrÃºshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under
  7787	the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the
  7788	room. DenÃ­sov silently watched LavrÃºshkaâs movements, and when the
  7789	latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
  7790	DenÃ­sov glanced at RostÃ³v.
  7791	
  7792	âWostÃ³v, youâve not been playing schoolboy twicks...â
  7793	
  7794	RostÃ³v felt DenÃ­sovâs gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and
  7795	instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested
  7796	somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not
  7797	draw breath.
  7798	
  7799	âAnd there hasnât been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
  7800	yourselves. It must be here somewhere,â said LavrÃºshka.
  7801	
  7802	âNow then, you devilâs puppet, look alive and hunt for it!â
  7803	shouted DenÃ­sov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with
  7804	a threatening gesture. âIf the purse isnât found Iâll flog you,
  7805	Iâll flog you all.â
  7806	
  7807	RostÃ³v, his eyes avoiding DenÃ­sov, began buttoning his coat, buckled
  7808	on his saber, and put on his cap.
  7809	
  7810	âI must have that purse, I tell you,â shouted DenÃ­sov, shaking his
  7811	orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.
  7812	
  7813	âDenÃ­sov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,â said RostÃ³v,
  7814	going toward the door without raising his eyes. DenÃ­sov paused, thought
  7815	a moment, and, evidently understanding what RostÃ³v hinted at, seized
  7816	his arm.
  7817	
  7818	âNonsense!â he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood
  7819	out like cords. âYou are mad, I tell you. I wonât allow it.
  7820	The purse is here! Iâll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be
  7821	found.â
  7822	
  7823	âI know who has taken it,â repeated RostÃ³v in an unsteady voice,
  7824	and went to the door.
  7825	
  7826	âAnd I tell you, donât you dahe to do it!â shouted DenÃ­sov,
  7827	rushing at the cadet to restrain him.
  7828	
  7829	But RostÃ³v pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though
  7830	DenÃ­sov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his
  7831	face.
  7832	
  7833	âDo you understand what youâre saying?â he said in a trembling
  7834	voice. âThere was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it
  7835	is not so, then...â
  7836	
  7837	He could not finish, and ran out of the room.
  7838	
  7839	âAh, may the devil take you and evewybody,â were the last words
  7840	RostÃ³v heard.
  7841	
  7842	RostÃ³v went to TelyÃ¡ninâs quarters.
  7843	
  7844	âThe master is not in, heâs gone to headquarters,â said
  7845	TelyÃ¡ninâs orderly. âHas something happened?â he added, surprised
  7846	at the cadetâs troubled face.
  7847	
  7848	âNo, nothing.â
  7849	
  7850	âYouâve only just missed him,â said the orderly.
  7851	
  7852	The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and
  7853	RostÃ³v, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was
  7854	an inn in the village which the officers frequented. RostÃ³v rode up to
  7855	it and saw TelyÃ¡ninâs horse at the porch.
  7856	
  7857	In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of
  7858	sausages and a bottle of wine.
  7859	
  7860	âAh, youâve come here too, young man!â he said, smiling and
  7861	raising his eyebrows.
  7862	
  7863	âYes,â said RostÃ³v as if it cost him a great deal to utter the
  7864	word; and he sat down at the nearest table.
  7865	
  7866	Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the
  7867	room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives
  7868	and the munching of the lieutenant.
  7869	
  7870	When TelyÃ¡nin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double
  7871	purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up
  7872	fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to
  7873	the waiter.
  7874	
  7875	âPlease be quick,â he said.
  7876	
  7877	The coin was a new one. RostÃ³v rose and went up to TelyÃ¡nin.
  7878	
  7879	âAllow me to look at your purse,â he said in a low, almost
  7880	inaudible, voice.
  7881	
  7882	With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, TelyÃ¡nin handed him the
  7883	purse.
  7884	
  7885	âYes, itâs a nice purse. Yes, yes,â he said, growing suddenly
  7886	pale, and added, âLook at it, young man.â
  7887	
  7888	RostÃ³v took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and
  7889	looked at TelyÃ¡nin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way
  7890	and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.
  7891	
  7892	âIf we get to Vienna Iâll get rid of it there but in these wretched
  7893	little towns thereâs nowhere to spend it,â said he. âWell, let me
  7894	have it, young man, Iâm going.â
  7895	
  7896	RostÃ³v did not speak.
  7897	
  7898	âAnd you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite
  7899	decently here,â continued TelyÃ¡nin. âNow then, let me have it.â
  7900	
  7901	He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. RostÃ³v let go of
  7902	it. TelyÃ¡nin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the
  7903	pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth
  7904	slightly open, as if to say, âYes, yes, I am putting my purse in my
  7905	pocket and thatâs quite simple and is no one elseâs business.â
  7906	
  7907	âWell, young man?â he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted
  7908	brows he glanced into RostÃ³vâs eyes.
  7909	
  7910	Some flash as of an electric spark shot from TelyÃ¡ninâs eyes to
  7911	RostÃ³vâs and back, and back again and again in an instant.
  7912	
  7913	âCome here,â said RostÃ³v, catching hold of TelyÃ¡ninâs arm and
  7914	almost dragging him to the window. âThat money is DenÃ­sovâs; you
  7915	took it...â he whispered just above TelyÃ¡ninâs ear.
  7916	
  7917	âWhat? What? How dare you? What?â said TelyÃ¡nin.
  7918	
  7919	But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for
  7920	pardon. As soon as RostÃ³v heard them, an enormous load of doubt
  7921	fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the
  7922	miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be
  7923	completed.
  7924	
  7925	âHeaven only knows what the people here may imagine,â muttered
  7926	TelyÃ¡nin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. âWe
  7927	must have an explanation...â
  7928	
  7929	âI know it and shall prove it,â said RostÃ³v.
  7930	
  7931	âI...â
  7932	
  7933	Every muscle of TelyÃ¡ninâs pale, terrified face began to quiver, his
  7934	eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising
  7935	to RostÃ³vâs face, and his sobs were audible.
  7936	
  7937	âCount!... Donât ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money,
  7938	take it...â He threw it on the table. âI have an old father and
  7939	mother!...â
  7940	
  7941	RostÃ³v took the money, avoiding TelyÃ¡ninâs eyes, and went out of the
  7942	room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his
  7943	steps. âO God,â he said with tears in his eyes, âhow could you do
  7944	it?â
  7945	
  7946	âCount...â said TelyÃ¡nin drawing nearer to him.
  7947	
  7948	âDonât touch me,â said RostÃ³v, drawing back. âIf you need it,
  7949	take the money,â and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.
  7950	
  7951	
  7952	
  7953	
  7954	
  7955	CHAPTER V
  7956	
  7957	That same evening there was an animated discussion among the
  7958	squadronâs officers in DenÃ­sovâs quarters.
  7959	
  7960	âAnd I tell you, RostÃ³v, that you must apologize to the colonel!â
  7961	said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and
  7962	many wrinkles on his large features, to RostÃ³v who was crimson with
  7963	excitement.
  7964	
  7965	The staff captain, KÃ­rsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for
  7966	affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.
  7967	
  7968	âI will allow no one to call me a liar!â cried RostÃ³v. âHe told
  7969	me I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me
  7970	on duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make
  7971	me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it
  7972	beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...â
  7973	
  7974	âYou just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,â interrupted
  7975	the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache.
  7976	âYou tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an
  7977	officer has stolen...â
  7978	
  7979	âIâm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of
  7980	other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am
  7981	not a diplomatist. Thatâs why I joined the hussars, thinking that here
  7982	one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lyingâso let him
  7983	give me satisfaction...â
  7984	
  7985	âThatâs all right. No one thinks you a coward, but thatâs not the
  7986	point. Ask DenÃ­sov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to
  7987	demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?â
  7988	
  7989	DenÃ­sov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
  7990	conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the
  7991	staff captainâs question by a disapproving shake of his head.
  7992	
  7993	âYou speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
  7994	officers,â continued the staff captain, âand BogdÃ¡nichâ (the
  7995	colonel was called BogdÃ¡nich) âshuts you up.â
  7996	
  7997	âHe did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.â
  7998	
  7999	âWell, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must
  8000	apologize.â
  8001	
  8002	âNot on any account!â exclaimed RostÃ³v.
  8003	
  8004	âI did not expect this of you,â said the staff captain seriously and
  8005	severely. âYou donât wish to apologize, but, man, itâs not only to
  8006	him but to the whole regimentâall of usâyouâre to blame all round.
  8007	The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and
  8008	taken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the
  8009	officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and
  8010	disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one
  8011	scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We donât see it like that. And
  8012	BogdÃ¡nich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true.
  8013	Itâs not pleasant, but whatâs to be done, my dear fellow? You landed
  8014	yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some
  8015	conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole
  8016	affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not
  8017	apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever BogdÃ¡nich may
  8018	be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! Youâre quick at
  8019	taking offense, but you donât mind disgracing the whole regiment!â
  8020	The staff captainâs voice began to tremble. âYou have been in the
  8021	regiment next to no time, my lad, youâre here today and tomorrow
  8022	youâll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when
  8023	it is said âThere are thieves among the PÃ¡vlograd officers!â But
  8024	itâs not all the same to us! Am I not right, DenÃ­sov? Itâs not the
  8025	same!â
  8026	
  8027	DenÃ­sov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with
  8028	his glittering black eyes at RostÃ³v.
  8029	
  8030	âYou value your own pride and donât wish to apologize,â continued
  8031	the staff captain, âbut we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God
  8032	willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the
  8033	regiment, and BogdÃ¡nich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And
  8034	all this is not right, itâs not right! You may take offense or not but
  8035	I always stick to mother truth. Itâs not right!â
  8036	
  8037	And the staff captain rose and turned away from RostÃ³v.
  8038	
  8039	âThatâs twue, devil take it!â shouted DenÃ­sov, jumping up. âNow
  8040	then, WostÃ³v, now then!â
  8041	
  8042	RostÃ³v, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer
  8043	and then at the other.
  8044	
  8045	âNo, gentlemen, no... you mustnât think... I quite understand.
  8046	Youâre wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of
  8047	the regiment Iâd... Ah well, Iâll show that in action, and for me
  8048	the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, itâs true Iâm to blame,
  8049	to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...â
  8050	
  8051	âCome, thatâs right, Count!â cried the staff captain, turning
  8052	round and clapping RostÃ³v on the shoulder with his big hand.
  8053	
  8054	âI tell you,â shouted DenÃ­sov, âheâs a fine fellow.â
  8055	
  8056	âThatâs better, Count,â said the staff captain, beginning to
  8057	address RostÃ³v by his title, as if in recognition of his confession.
  8058	âGo and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!â
  8059	
  8060	âGentlemen, Iâll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,â
  8061	said RostÃ³v in an imploring voice, âbut I canât apologize, by God I
  8062	canât, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy
  8063	asking forgiveness?â
  8064	
  8065	DenÃ­sov began to laugh.
  8066	
  8067	âItâll be worse for you. BogdÃ¡nich is vindictive and youâll pay
  8068	for your obstinacy,â said KÃ­rsten.
  8069	
  8070	âNo, on my word itâs not obstinacy! I canât describe the feeling.
  8071	I canât...â
  8072	
  8073	âWell, itâs as you like,â said the staff captain. âAnd what has
  8074	become of that scoundrel?â he asked DenÃ­sov.
  8075	
  8076	âHe has weported himself sick, heâs to be stwuck off the list
  8077	tomowwow,â muttered DenÃ­sov.
  8078	
  8079	âIt is an illness, thereâs no other way of explaining it,â said
  8080	the staff captain.
  8081	
  8082	âIllness or not, heâd better not cwoss my path. Iâd kill him!â
  8083	shouted DenÃ­sov in a bloodthirsty tone.
  8084	
  8085	Just then ZherkÃ³v entered the room.
  8086	
  8087	âWhat brings you here?â cried the officers turning to the newcomer.
  8088	
  8089	âWeâre to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his
  8090	whole army.â
  8091	
  8092	âItâs not true!â
  8093	
  8094	âIâve seen him myself!â
  8095	
  8096	âWhat? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?â
  8097	
  8098	âInto action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how
  8099	did you come here?â
  8100	
  8101	âIâve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil,
  8102	Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on
  8103	Mackâs arrival... Whatâs the matter, RostÃ³v? You look as if youâd
  8104	just come out of a hot bath.â
  8105	
  8106	âOh, my dear fellow, weâre in such a stew here these last two
  8107	days.â
  8108	
  8109	The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
  8110	ZherkÃ³v. They were under orders to advance next day.
  8111	
  8112	âWeâre going into action, gentlemen!â
  8113	
  8114	âWell, thank God! Weâve been sitting here too long!â
  8115	
  8116	
  8117	
  8118	
  8119	
  8120	CHAPTER VI
  8121	
  8122	KutÃºzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over
  8123	the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October 23 the
  8124	Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian
  8125	baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling
  8126	through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.
  8127	
  8128	It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out
  8129	before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the
  8130	bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and
  8131	then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could
  8132	be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below,
  8133	the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its
  8134	cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling
  8135	masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island,
  8136	and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of
  8137	the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the
  8138	Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green
  8139	treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a
  8140	wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the
  8141	enemyâs horse patrols could be discerned.
  8142	
  8143	Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
  8144	the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through
  8145	his fieldglass. A little behind them NesvÃ­tski, who had been sent to
  8146	the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a
  8147	gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack
  8148	and a flask, and NesvÃ­tski was treating some officers to pies and real
  8149	doppelkÃ¼mmel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their
  8150	knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.
  8151	
  8152	âYes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. Itâs
  8153	a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?â NesvÃ­tski
  8154	was saying.
  8155	
  8156	âThank you very much, Prince,â answered one of the officers, pleased
  8157	to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. âItâs a lovely
  8158	place! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a
  8159	splendid house!â
  8160	
  8161	âLook, Prince,â said another, who would have dearly liked to take
  8162	another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the
  8163	countrysideââSee, our infantrymen have already got there. Look there
  8164	in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something.
  8165	Theyâll ransack that castle,â he remarked with evident approval.
  8166	
  8167	âSo they will,â said NesvÃ­tski. âNo, but what I should like,â
  8168	added he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, âwould be
  8169	to slip in over there.â
  8170	
  8171	He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and
  8172	gleamed.
  8173	
  8174	âThat would be fine, gentlemen!â
  8175	
  8176	The officers laughed.
  8177	
  8178	âJust to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls
  8179	among them. On my word Iâd give five years of my life for it!â
  8180	
  8181	âThey must be feeling dull, too,â said one of the bolder officers,
  8182	laughing.
  8183	
  8184	Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to
  8185	the general, who looked through his field glass.
  8186	
  8187	âYes, so it is, so it is,â said the general angrily, lowering the
  8188	field glass and shrugging his shoulders, âso it is! Theyâll be fired
  8189	on at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?â
  8190	
  8191	On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from
  8192	their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of
  8193	a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.
  8194	
  8195	NesvÃ­tski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.
  8196	
  8197	âWould not your excellency like a little refreshment?â he said.
  8198	
  8199	âItâs a bad business,â said the general without answering him,
  8200	âour men have been wasting time.â
  8201	
  8202	âHadnât I better ride over, your excellency?â asked NesvÃ­tski.
  8203	
  8204	âYes, please do,â answered the general, and he repeated the order
  8205	that had already once been given in detail: âand tell the hussars
  8206	that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the
  8207	inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.â
  8208	
  8209	âVery good,â answered NesvÃ­tski.
  8210	
  8211	He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack
  8212	and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.
  8213	
  8214	âIâll really call in on the nuns,â he said to the officers who
  8215	watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the
  8216	hill.
  8217	
  8218	âNow then, letâs see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!â
  8219	said the general, turning to an artillery officer. âHave a little fun
  8220	to pass the time.â
  8221	
  8222	âCrew, to your guns!â commanded the officer.
  8223	
  8224	In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began
  8225	loading.
  8226	
  8227	âOne!â came the command.
  8228	
  8229	Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening
  8230	metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our
  8231	troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke
  8232	showing the spot where it burst.
  8233	
  8234	The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got
  8235	up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly
  8236	visible as if but a stoneâs throw away, and the movements of the
  8237	approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully
  8238	out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot
  8239	and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and
  8240	spirited impression.
  8241	
  8242	
  8243	
  8244	
  8245	
  8246	CHAPTER VII
  8247	
  8248	Two of the enemyâs shots had already flown across the bridge, where
  8249	there was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince NesvÃ­tski, who had
  8250	alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the
  8251	railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few
  8252	steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince
  8253	NesvÃ­tski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again
  8254	and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.
  8255	
  8256	âWhat a fine fellow you are, friend!â said the Cossack to a convoy
  8257	soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
  8258	crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. âWhat a fellow!
  8259	You canât wait a moment! Donât you see the general wants to pass?â
  8260	
  8261	But the convoyman took no notice of the word âgeneralâ and shouted
  8262	at the soldiers who were blocking his way. âHi there, boys! Keep to
  8263	the left! Wait a bit.â But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to
  8264	shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense
  8265	mass. Looking down over the rails Prince NesvÃ­tski saw the rapid, noisy
  8266	little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of
  8267	the bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally
  8268	uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos,
  8269	knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with
  8270	broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and
  8271	feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
  8272	bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of
  8273	white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with
  8274	a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along;
  8275	sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot,
  8276	an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry;
  8277	and sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officersâ or
  8278	companyâs baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on
  8279	all sides, moved across the bridge.
  8280	
  8281	âItâs as if a dam had burst,â said the Cossack hopelessly. âAre
  8282	there many more of you to come?â
  8283	
  8284	âA million all but one!â replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat,
  8285	with a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.
  8286	
  8287	âIf heâ (he meant the enemy) âbegins popping at the bridge now,â
  8288	said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, âyouâll forget to
  8289	scratch yourself.â
  8290	
  8291	That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.
  8292	
  8293	âWhere the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?â said an
  8294	orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.
  8295	
  8296	And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who
  8297	had evidently been drinking.
  8298	
  8299	âAnd then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt
  8300	end of his gun...â a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said
  8301	gaily, with a wide swing of his arm.
  8302	
  8303	âYes, the ham was just delicious...â answered another with a loud
  8304	laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that NesvÃ­tski did not learn who
  8305	had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.
  8306	
  8307	âBah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think theyâll
  8308	all be killed,â a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.
  8309	
  8310	âAs it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,â said a young soldier
  8311	with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, âI felt like
  8312	dying of fright. I did, âpon my word, I got that frightened!â said
  8313	he, as if bragging of having been frightened.
  8314	
  8315	That one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone
  8316	before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and
  8317	seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with
  8318	a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned
  8319	baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks
  8320	were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were
  8321	allowed to pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers
  8322	turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace
  8323	all the soldiersâ remarks related to the two young ones. Every face
  8324	bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the
  8325	women.
  8326	
  8327	âJust see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!â
  8328	
  8329	âSell me the missis,â said another soldier, addressing the German,
  8330	who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast
  8331	eyes.
  8332	
  8333	âSee how smart sheâs made herself! Oh, the devils!â
  8334	
  8335	âThere, FedÃ³tov, you should be quartered on them!â
  8336	
  8337	âI have seen as much before now, mate!â
  8338	
  8339	âWhere are you going?â asked an infantry officer who was eating an
  8340	apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.
  8341	
  8342	The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.
  8343	
  8344	âTake it if you like,â said the officer, giving the girl an apple.
  8345	
  8346	The girl smiled and took it. NesvÃ­tski like the rest of the men on the
  8347	bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When
  8348	they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same
  8349	kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of
  8350	a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole
  8351	crowd had to wait.
  8352	
  8353	âAnd why are they stopping? Thereâs no proper order!â said the
  8354	soldiers. âWhere are you shoving to? Devil take you! Canât you wait?
  8355	Itâll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, hereâs an officer jammed
  8356	in tooââdifferent voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked
  8357	at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.
  8358	
  8359	Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, NesvÃ­tski
  8360	suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...
  8361	something big, that splashed into the water.
  8362	
  8363	âJust see where it carries to!â a soldier near by said sternly,
  8364	looking round at the sound.
  8365	
  8366	âEncouraging us to get along quicker,â said another uneasily.
  8367	
  8368	The crowd moved on again. NesvÃ­tski realized that it was a cannon ball.
  8369	
  8370	âHey, Cossack, my horse!â he said. âNow, then, you there! get out
  8371	of the way! Make way!â
  8372	
  8373	With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting
  8374	continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way
  8375	for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those
  8376	nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still
  8377	harder from behind.
  8378	
  8379	âNesvÃ­tski, NesvÃ­tski! you numskull!â came a hoarse voice from
  8380	behind him.
  8381	
  8382	NesvÃ­tski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated
  8383	by the living mass of moving infantry, VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, red and shaggy,
  8384	with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily
  8385	over his shoulder.
  8386	
  8387	âTell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!â shouted DenÃ­sov
  8388	evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot
  8389	whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small
  8390	bare hand as red as his face.
  8391	
  8392	âAh, VÃ¡ska!â joyfully replied NesvÃ­tski. âWhatâs up with
  8393	you?â
  8394	
  8395	âThe squadwon canât pass,â shouted VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, showing his
  8396	white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which
  8397	twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting
  8398	white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his
  8399	hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let
  8400	him. âWhat is this? Theyâre like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the
  8401	way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart! Iâll hack
  8402	you with my saber!â he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its
  8403	scabbard and flourishing it.
  8404	
  8405	The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and
  8406	DenÃ­sov joined NesvÃ­tski.
  8407	
  8408	âHowâs it youâre not drunk today?â said NesvÃ­tski when the
  8409	other had ridden up to him.
  8410	
  8411	âThey donât even give one time to dwink!â answered VÃ¡ska
  8412	DenÃ­sov. âThey keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they
  8413	mean to fight, letâs fight. But the devil knows what this is.â
  8414	
  8415	âWhat a dandy you are today!â said NesvÃ­tski, looking at
  8416	DenÃ­sovâs new cloak and saddlecloth.
  8417	
  8418	DenÃ­sov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused
  8419	a smell of perfume, and put it to NesvÃ­tskiâs nose.
  8420	
  8421	âOf course. Iâm going into action! Iâve shaved, bwushed my teeth,
  8422	and scented myself.â
  8423	
  8424	The imposing figure of NesvÃ­tski followed by his Cossack, and
  8425	the determination of DenÃ­sov who flourished his sword and shouted
  8426	frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through
  8427	to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the
  8428	bridge NesvÃ­tski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order,
  8429	and having done this he rode back.
  8430	
  8431	Having cleared the way DenÃ­sov stopped at the end of the bridge.
  8432	Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
  8433	ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw
  8434	nearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,
  8435	resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in
  8436	front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge
  8437	on his side of it.
  8438	
  8439	The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
  8440	trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will,
  8441	estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually
  8442	encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in
  8443	regular order.
  8444	
  8445	âSmart lads! Only fit for a fair!â said one.
  8446	
  8447	âWhat good are they? Theyâre led about just for show!â remarked
  8448	another.
  8449	
  8450	âDonât kick up the dust, you infantry!â jested an hussar whose
  8451	prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.
  8452	
  8453	âIâd like to put you on a two daysâ march with a knapsack! Your
  8454	fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed,â said an infantryman, wiping
  8455	the mud off his face with his sleeve. âPerched up there, youâre more
  8456	like a bird than a man.â
  8457	
  8458	âThere now, ZÃ­kin, they ought to put you on a horse. Youâd look
  8459	fine,â said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under
  8460	the weight of his knapsack.
  8461	
  8462	âTake a stick between your legs, thatâll suit you for a horse!â
  8463	the hussar shouted back.
  8464	
  8465	
  8466	
  8467	
  8468	
  8469	CHAPTER VIII
  8470	
  8471	The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing
  8472	together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last
  8473	the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last
  8474	battalion came onto the bridge. Only DenÃ­sovâs squadron of hussars
  8475	remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could
  8476	be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from
  8477	the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
  8478	river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away.
  8479	At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our
  8480	Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high
  8481	ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the
  8482	French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All
  8483	the officers and men of DenÃ­sovâs squadron, though they tried to talk
  8484	of other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what
  8485	was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches
  8486	appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemyâs troops.
  8487	The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending
  8488	brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and
  8489	at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard
  8490	from the hill. There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy
  8491	except a few scattered skirmishers. An empty space of some seven hundred
  8492	yards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firing, and that
  8493	stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates
  8494	two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.
  8495	
  8496	âOne step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing
  8497	the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And
  8498	what is there? Who is there?âthere beyond that field, that tree, that
  8499	roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear
  8500	and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must
  8501	be crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will
  8502	inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are
  8503	strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such
  8504	excitedly animated and healthy men.â So thinks, or at any rate
  8505	feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives
  8506	a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that
  8507	takes place at such moments.
  8508	
  8509	On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose,
  8510	and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The
  8511	officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The
  8512	hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole
  8513	squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron
  8514	commander, awaiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon
  8515	ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls
  8516	with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell
  8517	somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound
  8518	of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its
  8519	rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the
  8520	ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers
  8521	without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their
  8522	comradesâ impression. Every face, from DenÃ­sovâs to that of the
  8523	bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and
  8524	excitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking
  8525	at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet MirÃ³nov ducked
  8526	every time a ball flew past. RostÃ³v on the left flank, mounted on his
  8527	Rookâa handsome horse despite its game legâhad the happy air of a
  8528	schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which
  8529	he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone
  8530	with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly
  8531	he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same
  8532	indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.
  8533	
  8534	âWhoâs that curtseying there? Cadet MiwÃ³nov! Thatâs not wight!
  8535	Look at me,â cried DenÃ­sov who, unable to keep still on one spot,
  8536	kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.
  8537	
  8538	The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, and his whole
  8539	short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in
  8540	which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually
  8541	did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he
  8542	was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds
  8543	when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his
  8544	good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the
  8545	saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in
  8546	a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to
  8547	KÃ­rsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a
  8548	walk to meet him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always,
  8549	only his eyes were brighter than usual.
  8550	
  8551	âWell, what about it?â said he to DenÃ­sov. âIt wonât come to a
  8552	fight. Youâll seeâwe shall retire.â
  8553	
  8554	âThe devil only knows what theyâre about!â muttered DenÃ­sov.
  8555	âAh, WostÃ³v,â he cried noticing the cadetâs bright face,
  8556	âyouâve got it at last.â
  8557	
  8558	And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. RostÃ³v
  8559	felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge.
  8560	DenÃ­sov galloped up to him.
  8561	
  8562	âYour excellency! Let us attack them! Iâll dwive them off.â
  8563	
  8564	âAttack indeed!â said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his
  8565	face as if driving off a troublesome fly. âAnd why are you stopping
  8566	here? Donât you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron
  8567	back.â
  8568	
  8569	The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without
  8570	having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front
  8571	line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side
  8572	of the river.
  8573	
  8574	The two PÃ¡vlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the
  8575	hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl BogdÃ¡nich Schubert, came
  8576	up to DenÃ­sovâs squadron and rode at a footpace not far from RostÃ³v,
  8577	without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
  8578	first time since their encounter concerning TelyÃ¡nin. RostÃ³v, feeling
  8579	that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now
  8580	admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the
  8581	colonelâs athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red
  8582	neck. It seemed to RostÃ³v that BogdÃ¡nich was only pretending not
  8583	to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadetâs
  8584	courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it
  8585	seemed to him that BogdÃ¡nich rode so near in order to show him his
  8586	courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a
  8587	desperate attack just to punish himâRostÃ³v. Then he imagined how,
  8588	after the attack, BogdÃ¡nich would come up to him as he lay wounded and
  8589	would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.
  8590	
  8591	The high-shouldered figure of ZherkÃ³v, familiar to the PÃ¡vlograds as
  8592	he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel.
  8593	After his dismissal from headquarters ZherkÃ³v had not remained in the
  8594	regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he
  8595	could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded
  8596	in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince BagratiÃ³n. He now
  8597	came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear
  8598	guard.
  8599	
  8600	âColonel,â he said, addressing RostÃ³vâs enemy with an air of
  8601	gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, âthere is an order
  8602	to stop and fire the bridge.â
  8603	
  8604	âAn order to who?â asked the colonel morosely.
  8605	
  8606	âI donât myself know âto who,ââ replied the cornet in a
  8607	serious tone, âbut the prince told me to âgo and tell the colonel
  8608	that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.ââ
  8609	
  8610	ZherkÃ³v was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
  8611	colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout NesvÃ­tski
  8612	came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
  8613	weight.
  8614	
  8615	âHowâs this, Colonel?â he shouted as he approached. âI told you
  8616	to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all
  8617	beside themselves over there and one canât make anything out.â
  8618	
  8619	The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to NesvÃ­tski.
  8620	
  8621	âYou spoke to me of inflammable material,â said he, âbut you said
  8622	nothing about firing it.â
  8623	
  8624	âBut, my dear sir,â said NesvÃ­tski as he drew up, taking off his
  8625	cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand,
  8626	âwasnât I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material
  8627	had been put in position?â
  8628	
  8629	âI am not your âdear sir,â Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell
  8630	me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders
  8631	strictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would
  8632	burn it, I could not know by the holy spirit!â
  8633	
  8634	âAh, thatâs always the way!â said NesvÃ­tski with a wave of the
  8635	hand. âHow did you get here?â said he, turning to ZherkÃ³v.
  8636	
  8637	âOn the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!â
  8638	
  8639	âYou were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...â continued the colonel in an
  8640	offended tone.
  8641	
  8642	âColonel,â interrupted the officer of the suite, âYou must be
  8643	quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.â
  8644	
  8645	The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout
  8646	staff officer, and at ZherkÃ³v, and he frowned.
  8647	
  8648	âI will the bridge fire,â he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
  8649	that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
  8650	do the right thing.
  8651	
  8652	Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame
  8653	for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
  8654	squadron, that in which RostÃ³v was serving under DenÃ­sov, to return to
  8655	the bridge.
  8656	
  8657	âThere, itâs just as I thought,â said RostÃ³v to himself. âHe
  8658	wishes to test me!â His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his
  8659	face. âLet him see whether I am a coward!â he thought.
  8660	
  8661	Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression
  8662	appeared that they had worn when under fire. RostÃ³v watched his enemy,
  8663	the colonel, closelyâto find in his face confirmation of his own
  8664	conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at RostÃ³v, and looked
  8665	as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word
  8666	of command.
  8667	
  8668	âLook sharp! Look sharp!â several voices repeated around him.
  8669	
  8670	Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the
  8671	hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men
  8672	were crossing themselves. RostÃ³v no longer looked at the colonel, he
  8673	had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid
  8674	that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into
  8675	an orderlyâs charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with
  8676	a thud. DenÃ­sov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something.
  8677	RostÃ³v saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs
  8678	catching and their sabers clattering.
  8679	
  8680	âStretchers!â shouted someone behind him.
  8681	
  8682	RostÃ³v did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,
  8683	trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not
  8684	looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled,
  8685	and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.
  8686	
  8687	âAt boss zides, Captain,â he heard the voice of the colonel, who,
  8688	having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a
  8689	triumphant, cheerful face.
  8690	
  8691	RostÃ³v wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
  8692	was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front
  8693	the better. But BogdÃ¡nich, without looking at or recognizing RostÃ³v,
  8694	shouted to him:
  8695	
  8696	âWhoâs that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come
  8697	back, Cadet!â he cried angrily; and turning to DenÃ­sov, who, showing
  8698	off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:
  8699	
  8700	âWhy run risks, Captain? You should dismount,â he said.
  8701	
  8702	âOh, every bullet has its billet,â answered VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, turning
  8703	in his saddle.
  8704	
  8705	
  8706	Meanwhile NesvÃ­tski, ZherkÃ³v, and the officer of the suite were
  8707	standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small
  8708	group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord,
  8709	and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at
  8710	what was approaching in the distance from the opposite sideâthe blue
  8711	uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.
  8712	
  8713	âWill they burn the bridge or not? Whoâll get there first? Will they
  8714	get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot
  8715	range and wipe them out?â These were the questions each man of the
  8716	troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself
  8717	with a sinking heartâwatching the bridge and the hussars in the bright
  8718	evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with
  8719	their bayonets and guns.
  8720	
  8721	âUgh. The hussars will get it hot!â said NesvÃ­tski; âthey are
  8722	within grapeshot range now.â
  8723	
  8724	âHe shouldnât have taken so many men,â said the officer of the
  8725	suite.
  8726	
  8727	âTrue enough,â answered NesvÃ­tski; âtwo smart fellows could have
  8728	done the job just as well.â
  8729	
  8730	âAh, your excellency,â put in ZherkÃ³v, his eyes fixed on the
  8731	hussars, but still with that naÃ¯ve air that made it impossible to know
  8732	whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. âAh, your excellency!
  8733	How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the
  8734	VladÃ­mir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the
  8735	squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our
  8736	BogdÃ¡nich knows how things are done.â
  8737	
  8738	âThere now!â said the officer of the suite, âthatâs
  8739	grapeshot.â
  8740	
  8741	He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached
  8742	and hurriedly removed.
  8743	
  8744	On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke
  8745	appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the
  8746	moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two
  8747	reports one after another, and a third.
  8748	
  8749	âOh! Oh!â groaned NesvÃ­tski as if in fierce pain, seizing the
  8750	officer of the suite by the arm. âLook! A man has fallen! Fallen,
  8751	fallen!â
  8752	
  8753	âTwo, I think.â
  8754	
  8755	âIf I were Tsar I would never go to war,â said NesvÃ­tski, turning
  8756	away.
  8757	
  8758	The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue
  8759	uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again
  8760	but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
  8761	bridge. But this time NesvÃ­tski could not see what was happening there,
  8762	as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in
  8763	setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no
  8764	longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was
  8765	someone to fire at.
  8766	
  8767	The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars
  8768	got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too
  8769	high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and
  8770	knocked three of them over.
  8771	
  8772	RostÃ³v, absorbed by his relations with BogdÃ¡nich, had paused on the
  8773	bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he
  8774	had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the
  8775	bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the
  8776	other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a
  8777	rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest
  8778	to him fell against the rails with a groan. RostÃ³v ran up to him with
  8779	the others. Again someone shouted, âStretchers!â Four men seized the
  8780	hussar and began lifting him.
  8781	
  8782	âOooh! For Christâs sake let me alone!â cried the wounded man, but
  8783	still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.
  8784	
  8785	Nicholas RostÃ³v turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed
  8786	into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the
  8787	sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep!
  8788	How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the
  8789	waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway
  8790	blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and
  8791	the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace
  8792	and happiness... âI should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I
  8793	were there,â thought RostÃ³v. âIn myself alone and in that sunshine
  8794	there is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, fear, and
  8795	this uncertainty and hurry... Thereâthey are shouting again, and
  8796	again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it,
  8797	death, is here above me and around... Another instant and I shall never
  8798	again see the sun, this water, that gorge!...â
  8799	
  8800	At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other
  8801	stretchers came into view before RostÃ³v. And the fear of death and of
  8802	the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one
  8803	feeling of sickening agitation.
  8804	
  8805	âO Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect
  8806	me!â RostÃ³v whispered.
  8807	
  8808	The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices
  8809	sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.
  8810	
  8811	âWell, fwiend? So youâve smelt powdah!â shouted VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov
  8812	just above his ear.
  8813	
  8814	âItâs all over; but I am a cowardâyes, a coward!â thought
  8815	RostÃ³v, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting
  8816	one foot, from the orderly and began to mount.
  8817	
  8818	âWas that grapeshot?â he asked DenÃ­sov.
  8819	
  8820	âYes and no mistake!â cried DenÃ­sov. âYou worked like wegular
  8821	bwicks and itâs nasty work! An attackâs pleasant work! Hacking
  8822	away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them
  8823	shooting at you like a target.â
  8824	
  8825	And DenÃ­sov rode up to a group that had stopped near RostÃ³v, composed
  8826	of the colonel, NesvÃ­tski, ZherkÃ³v, and the officer from the suite.
  8827	
  8828	âWell, it seems that no one has noticed,â thought RostÃ³v. And this
  8829	was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation
  8830	which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.
  8831	
  8832	âHereâs something for you to report,â said ZherkÃ³v. âSee if I
  8833	donât get promoted to a sublieutenancy.â
  8834	
  8835	âInform the prince that I the bridge fired!â said the colonel
  8836	triumphantly and gaily.
  8837	
  8838	âAnd if he asks about the losses?â
  8839	
  8840	âA trifle,â said the colonel in his bass voice: âtwo hussars
  8841	wounded, and one knocked out,â he added, unable to restrain a happy
  8842	smile, and pronouncing the phrase âknocked outâ with ringing
  8843	distinctness.
  8844	
  8845	
  8846	
  8847	
  8848	
  8849	CHAPTER IX
  8850	
  8851	Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command
  8852	of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it,
  8853	losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies,
  8854	and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had
  8855	been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded
  8856	by KutÃºzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where
  8857	overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as
  8858	necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment.
  8859	There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the
  8860	courage and enduranceâacknowledged even by the enemyâwith which the
  8861	Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more
  8862	rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had
  8863	joined KutÃºzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and
  8864	KutÃºzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The
  8865	defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an
  8866	offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the
  8867	modern science of strategics, had been handed to KutÃºzov when he was in
  8868	Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable
  8869	aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were
  8870	advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.
  8871	
  8872	On the twenty-eighth of October KutÃºzov with his army crossed to the
  8873	left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time
  8874	with the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the
  8875	thirtieth he attacked Mortierâs division, which was on the left bank,
  8876	and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken:
  8877	banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a
  8878	fortnightâs retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight
  8879	had not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though the
  8880	troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number
  8881	in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and
  8882	wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter
  8883	in which KutÃºzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and
  8884	though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military
  8885	hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the
  8886	stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of
  8887	the army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headquarters
  8888	most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
  8889	of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of
  8890	the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.
  8891	
  8892	Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian
  8893	General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been
  8894	wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark
  8895	of the commander in chiefâs special favor he was sent with the news of
  8896	this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was
  8897	threatened by the French) but at BrÃ¼nn. Despite his apparently delicate
  8898	build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many
  8899	very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived
  8900	at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from DokhtÃºrov to
  8901	KutÃºzov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to BrÃ¼nn.
  8902	To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward
  8903	promotion.
  8904	
  8905	The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that
  8906	had fallen the previous dayâthe day of the battle. Reviewing his
  8907	impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the
  8908	impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off
  8909	given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince
  8910	Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a
  8911	man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon
  8912	as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the
  8913	wheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that
  8914	the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he
  8915	quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that
  8916	this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away. He
  8917	again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage
  8918	during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark
  8919	starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was
  8920	thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides
  8921	of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.
  8922	
  8923	At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded.
  8924	The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front
  8925	cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of
  8926	the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being
  8927	jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian
  8928	words), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked
  8929	silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy
  8930	hurrying past them.
  8931	
  8932	Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what
  8933	action they had been wounded. âDay before yesterday, on the Danube,â
  8934	answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the
  8935	soldier three gold pieces.
  8936	
  8937	âThatâs for them all,â he said to the officer who came up.
  8938	
  8939	âGet well soon, lads!â he continued, turning to the soldiers.
  8940	âThereâs plenty to do still.â
  8941	
  8942	âWhat news, sir?â asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a
  8943	conversation.
  8944	
  8945	âGood news!... Go on!â he shouted to the driver, and they galloped
  8946	on.
  8947	
  8948	It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved
  8949	streets of BrÃ¼nn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the
  8950	lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that
  8951	atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a
  8952	soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night,
  8953	Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
  8954	alert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly
  8955	and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and
  8956	rapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer
  8957	dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself
  8958	stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual
  8959	questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give. He
  8960	expected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance
  8961	to the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and
  8962	learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.
  8963	
  8964	âTo the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find
  8965	the adjutant on duty,â said the official. âHe will conduct you to
  8966	the Minister of War.â
  8967	
  8968	The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went
  8969	in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing
  8970	with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a
  8971	corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The
  8972	adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
  8973	attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.
  8974	
  8975	Prince Andrewâs joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
  8976	approached the door of the ministerâs room. He felt offended, and
  8977	without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
  8978	one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly
  8979	suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise
  8980	the adjutant and the minister. âAway from the smell of powder, they
  8981	probably think it easy to gain victories!â he thought. His eyes
  8982	narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with
  8983	peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened
  8984	when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers
  8985	and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes
  8986	taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the
  8987	ministerâs bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading
  8988	to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the
  8989	sound of footsteps.
  8990	
  8991	âTake this and deliver it,â said he to his adjutant, handing him the
  8992	papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.
  8993	
  8994	Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of KutÃºzovâs army
  8995	interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was
  8996	concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that
  8997	impression. âBut that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,â he
  8998	thought. The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them
  8999	evenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual and distinctive
  9000	head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent
  9001	expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and
  9002	habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which
  9003	does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is
  9004	continually receiving many petitioners one after another.
  9005	
  9006	âFrom General Field Marshal KutÃºzov?â he asked. âI hope it is
  9007	good news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was
  9008	high time!â
  9009	
  9010	He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it
  9011	with a mournful expression.
  9012	
  9013	âOh, my God! My God! Schmidt!â he exclaimed in German. âWhat a
  9014	calamity! What a calamity!â
  9015	
  9016	Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
  9017	at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.
  9018	
  9019	âAh what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is
  9020	not captured.â Again he pondered. âI am very glad you have brought
  9021	good news, though Schmidtâs death is a heavy price to pay for the
  9022	victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I
  9023	thank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the
  9024	parade. However, I will let you know.â
  9025	
  9026	The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,
  9027	reappeared.
  9028	
  9029	âAu revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to
  9030	see you,â he added, bowing his head.
  9031	
  9032	When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest
  9033	and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
  9034	indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The
  9035	whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed
  9036	the memory of a remote event long past.
  9037	
  9038	
  9039	
  9040	
  9041	
  9042	CHAPTER X
  9043	
  9044	Prince Andrew stayed at BrÃ¼nn with BilÃ­bin, a Russian acquaintance of
  9045	his in the diplomatic service.
  9046	
  9047	âAh, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,â
  9048	said BilÃ­bin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. âFranz, put the
  9049	princeâs things in my bedroom,â said he to the servant who was
  9050	ushering BolkÃ³nski in. âSo youâre a messenger of victory, eh?
  9051	Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see.â
  9052	
  9053	After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomatâs
  9054	luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. BilÃ­bin
  9055	settled down comfortably beside the fire.
  9056	
  9057	After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of
  9058	all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince
  9059	Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such
  9060	as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant,
  9061	after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian
  9062	(for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he
  9063	supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was
  9064	then particularly strong.
  9065	
  9066	BilÃ­bin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as
  9067	Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but
  9068	had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with KutÃºzov.
  9069	Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high
  9070	in the military profession, so to an even greater extent BilÃ­bin gave
  9071	promise of rising in his diplomatic career. He was still a young man but
  9072	no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age
  9073	of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather
  9074	important post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador
  9075	in Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many
  9076	diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities,
  9077	avoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those,
  9078	who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would
  9079	sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well
  9080	whatever the import of his work. It was not the question âWhat for?â
  9081	but the question âHow?â that interested him. What the diplomatic
  9082	matter might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to
  9083	prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and
  9084	elegantly. BilÃ­binâs services were valued not only for what he wrote,
  9085	but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the
  9086	highest spheres.
  9087	
  9088	BilÃ­bin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be
  9089	made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say
  9090	something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was
  9091	possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,
  9092	finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the
  9093	inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so
  9094	that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to
  9095	drawing room. And, in fact, BilÃ­binâs witticisms were hawked about
  9096	in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters
  9097	considered important.
  9098	
  9099	His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always
  9100	looked as clean and well washed as the tips of oneâs fingers after a
  9101	Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play
  9102	of expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds
  9103	and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and
  9104	deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always
  9105	twinkled and looked out straight.
  9106	
  9107	âWell, now tell me about your exploits,â said he.
  9108	
  9109	BolkÃ³nski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the
  9110	engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.
  9111	
  9112	âThey received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
  9113	skittles,â said he in conclusion.
  9114	
  9115	BilÃ­bin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.
  9116	
  9117	âCependant, mon cher,â he remarked, examining his nails from a
  9118	distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, âmalgrÃ© la haute
  9119	estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, jâavoue que
  9120	votre victoire nâest pas des plus victorieuses.â *
  9121	
  9122	     * âBut my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox
  9123	     Russian army, I must say that your victory was not
  9124	     particularly victorious.â
  9125	
  9126	
  9127	He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in
  9128	Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.
  9129	
  9130	âCome now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier
  9131	and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers!
  9132	Whereâs the victory?â
  9133	
  9134	âBut seriously,â said Prince Andrew, âwe can at any rate say
  9135	without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...â
  9136	
  9137	âWhy didnât you capture one, just one, marshal for us?â
  9138	
  9139	âBecause not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness
  9140	of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by
  9141	seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon.â
  9142	
  9143	âAnd why didnât you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have
  9144	been there at seven in the morning,â returned BilÃ­bin with a smile.
  9145	âYou ought to have been there at seven in the morning.â
  9146	
  9147	âWhy did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic
  9148	methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?â retorted Prince Andrew
  9149	in the same tone.
  9150	
  9151	âI know,â interrupted BilÃ­bin, âyouâre thinking itâs very
  9152	easy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but
  9153	still why didnât you capture him? So donât be surprised if not only
  9154	the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and
  9155	King Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor
  9156	secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my
  9157	joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the
  9158	Prater... True, we have no Prater here...â
  9159	
  9160	He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
  9161	forehead.
  9162	
  9163	âIt is now my turn to ask you âwhy?â mon cher,â said BolkÃ³nski.
  9164	âI confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic
  9165	subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I canât make it
  9166	out. Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke
  9167	Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. KutÃºzov
  9168	alone at last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the
  9169	invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care
  9170	to hear the details.â
  9171	
  9172	âThatâs just it, my dear fellow. You see itâs hurrah for the Tsar,
  9173	for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but
  9174	what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring
  9175	us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one
  9176	archdukeâs as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only
  9177	over a fire brigade of Bonaparteâs, that will be another story and
  9178	weâll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done
  9179	on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke
  9180	Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its
  9181	defenseâas much as to say: âHeaven is with us, but heaven help you
  9182	and your capital!â The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you
  9183	expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit
  9184	that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived.
  9185	Itâs as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose
  9186	you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a
  9187	victory, what effect would that have on the general course of events?
  9188	Itâs too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!â
  9189	
  9190	âWhat? Occupied? Vienna occupied?â
  9191	
  9192	âNot only occupied, but Bonaparte is at SchÃ¶nbrunn, and the count,
  9193	our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.â
  9194	
  9195	After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and
  9196	especially after having dined, BolkÃ³nski felt that he could not take in
  9197	the full significance of the words he heard.
  9198	
  9199	âCount Lichtenfels was here this morning,â BilÃ­bin continued,
  9200	âand showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna
  9201	was fully described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that
  9202	your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you canât be
  9203	received as a savior.â
  9204	
  9205	âReally I donât care about that, I donât care at all,â said
  9206	Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle
  9207	before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as
  9208	the fall of Austriaâs capital. âHow is it Vienna was taken? What of
  9209	the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard
  9210	reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?â he said.
  9211	
  9212	âPrince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is
  9213	defending usâdoing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending
  9214	us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been
  9215	taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been
  9216	given to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago have been in the
  9217	mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a bad
  9218	quarter of an hour between two fires.â
  9219	
  9220	âBut still this does not mean that the campaign is over,â said
  9221	Prince Andrew.
  9222	
  9223	âWell, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they
  9224	darenât say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign,
  9225	it wonât be your skirmishing at DÃ¼rrenstein, or gunpowder at all,
  9226	that will decide the matter, but those who devised it,â said BilÃ­bin
  9227	quoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and
  9228	pausing. âThe only question is what will come of the meeting between
  9229	the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia
  9230	joins the Allies, Austriaâs hand will be forced and there will be war.
  9231	If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of
  9232	the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.â
  9233	
  9234	âWhat an extraordinary genius!â Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,
  9235	clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, âand what
  9236	luck the man has!â
  9237	
  9238	âBuonaparte?â said BilÃ­bin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead
  9239	to indicate that he was about to say something witty. âBuonaparte?â
  9240	he repeated, accentuating the u: âI think, however, now that he lays
  9241	down laws for Austria at SchÃ¶nbrunn, il faut lui faire grÃ¢ce de
  9242	lâu! * I shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply
  9243	Bonaparte!â
  9244	
  9245	    * âWe must let him off the u!â
  9246	
  9247	
  9248	âBut joking apart,â said Prince Andrew, âdo you really think the
  9249	campaign is over?â
  9250	
  9251	âThis is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is
  9252	not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the
  9253	first place because her provinces have been pillagedâthey say the Holy
  9254	Russian army loots terriblyâher army is destroyed, her capital
  9255	taken, and all this for the beaux yeux * of His Sardinian Majesty. And
  9256	thereforeâthis is between ourselvesâI instinctively feel that we
  9257	are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and
  9258	projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.â
  9259	
  9260	    * Fine eyes.
  9261	
  9262	âImpossible!â cried Prince Andrew. âThat would be too base.â
  9263	
  9264	âIf we live we shall see,â replied BilÃ­bin, his face again becoming
  9265	smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.
  9266	
  9267	When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a
  9268	clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he
  9269	felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far
  9270	away from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austriaâs treachery,
  9271	Bonaparteâs new triumph, tomorrowâs levee and parade, and the
  9272	audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.
  9273	
  9274	He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry
  9275	and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now
  9276	again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill,
  9277	the French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode
  9278	forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around,
  9279	and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since
  9280	childhood.
  9281	
  9282	He woke up...
  9283	
  9284	âYes, that all happened!â he said, and, smiling happily to himself
  9285	like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.
  9286	
  9287	
  9288	
  9289	
  9290	
  9291	CHAPTER XI
  9292	
  9293	Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first
  9294	thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented
  9295	to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite
  9296	Austrian adjutant, BilÃ­bin, and last nightâs conversation. Having
  9297	dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he
  9298	had not worn for a long time, he went into BilÃ­binâs study fresh,
  9299	animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four
  9300	gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte KurÃ¡gin,
  9301	who was a secretary to the embassy, BolkÃ³nski was already acquainted.
  9302	BilÃ­bin introduced him to the others.
  9303	
  9304	The gentlemen assembled at BilÃ­binâs were young, wealthy, gay society
  9305	men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which BilÃ­bin, their
  9306	leader, called les nÃ´tres. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of
  9307	diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with
  9308	war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to
  9309	the official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince
  9310	Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From
  9311	politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions
  9312	about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry
  9313	jests and gossip.
  9314	
  9315	    * Ours.
  9316	
  9317	âBut the best of it was,â said one, telling of the misfortune of
  9318	a fellow diplomat, âthat the Chancellor told him flatly that his
  9319	appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.
  9320	Can you fancy the figure he cut?...â
  9321	
  9322	âBut the worst of it, gentlemenâI am giving KurÃ¡gin away to
  9323	youâis that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is
  9324	taking advantage of it!â
  9325	
  9326	Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its
  9327	arm. He began to laugh.
  9328	
  9329	âTell me about that!â he said.
  9330	
  9331	âOh, you Don Juan! You serpent!â cried several voices.
  9332	
  9333	âYou, BolkÃ³nski, donât know,â said BilÃ­bin turning to Prince
  9334	Andrew, âthat all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of
  9335	the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing
  9336	among the women!â
  9337	
  9338	âLa femme est la compagne de lâhomme,â * announced Prince
  9339	Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.
  9340	
  9341	    * âWoman is manâs companion.â
  9342	
  9343	
  9344	BilÃ­bin and the rest of âoursâ burst out laughing in Hippolyteâs
  9345	face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whomâhe had to
  9346	admitâhe had almost been jealous on his wifeâs account, was the butt
  9347	of this set.
  9348	
  9349	âOh, I must give you a treat,â BilÃ­bin whispered to BolkÃ³nski.
  9350	âKurÃ¡gin is exquisite when he discusses politicsâyou should see his
  9351	gravity!â
  9352	
  9353	He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking
  9354	to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these
  9355	two.
  9356	
  9357	âThe Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,â began
  9358	Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, âwithout
  9359	expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless
  9360	His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...
  9361	
  9362	âWait, I have not finished...â he said to Prince Andrew, seizing
  9363	him by the arm, âI believe that intervention will be stronger than
  9364	nonintervention. And...â he paused. âFinally one cannot impute the
  9365	nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.â
  9366	And he released BolkÃ³nskiâs arm to indicate that he had now quite
  9367	finished.
  9368	
  9369	âDemosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden
  9370	mouth!â said BilÃ­bin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with
  9371	satisfaction.
  9372	
  9373	Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently
  9374	distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild
  9375	laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.
  9376	
  9377	âWell now, gentlemen,â said BilÃ­bin, âBolkÃ³nski is my guest in
  9378	this house and in BrÃ¼nn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I
  9379	can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would
  9380	be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult,
  9381	and I beg you all to help me. BrÃ¼nnâs attractions must be shown him.
  9382	You can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course
  9383	the women.â
  9384	
  9385	âWe must let him see Amelie, sheâs exquisite!â said one of
  9386	âours,â kissing his finger tips.
  9387	
  9388	âIn general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane
  9389	interests,â said BilÃ­bin.
  9390	
  9391	âI shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality,
  9392	gentlemen, it is already time for me to go,â replied Prince Andrew
  9393	looking at his watch.
  9394	
  9395	âWhere to?â
  9396	
  9397	âTo the Emperor.â
  9398	
  9399	âOh! Oh! Oh!â
  9400	
  9401	âWell, au revoir, BolkÃ³nski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to
  9402	dinner,â cried several voices. âWeâll take you in hand.â
  9403	
  9404	âWhen speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way
  9405	that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,â said BilÃ­bin,
  9406	accompanying him to the hall.
  9407	
  9408	âI should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts,
  9409	I canât,â replied BolkÃ³nski, smiling.
  9410	
  9411	âWell, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving
  9412	audiences, but he does not like talking himself and canât do it, as
  9413	you will see.â
  9414	
  9415	
  9416	
  9417	
  9418	
  9419	CHAPTER XII
  9420	
  9421	At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had
  9422	been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his
  9423	face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was
  9424	over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed
  9425	BolkÃ³nski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor
  9426	Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the
  9427	conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor
  9428	seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.
  9429	
  9430	âTell me, when did the battle begin?â he asked hurriedly.
  9431	
  9432	Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple:
  9433	âWas KutÃºzov well? When had he left Krems?â and so on. The Emperor
  9434	spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionsâthe
  9435	answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest
  9436	him.
  9437	
  9438	âAt what oâclock did the battle begin?â asked the Emperor.
  9439	
  9440	âI cannot inform Your Majesty at what oâclock the battle began at
  9441	the front, but at DÃ¼rrenstein, where I was, our attack began after
  9442	five in the afternoon,â replied BolkÃ³nski growing more animated and
  9443	expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which
  9444	he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor
  9445	smiled and interrupted him.
  9446	
  9447	âHow many miles?â
  9448	
  9449	âFrom where to where, Your Majesty?â
  9450	
  9451	âFrom DÃ¼rrenstein to Krems.â
  9452	
  9453	âThree and a half miles, Your Majesty.â
  9454	
  9455	âThe French have abandoned the left bank?â
  9456	
  9457	âAccording to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the
  9458	night.â
  9459	
  9460	âIs there sufficient forage in Krems?â
  9461	
  9462	âForage has not been supplied to the extent...â
  9463	
  9464	The Emperor interrupted him.
  9465	
  9466	âAt what oâclock was General Schmidt killed?â
  9467	
  9468	âAt seven oâclock, I believe.â
  9469	
  9470	âAt seven oâclock? Itâs very sad, very sad!â
  9471	
  9472	The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and
  9473	was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he
  9474	saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterdayâs adjutant
  9475	reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him
  9476	his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the
  9477	Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring
  9478	on him. The Empressâ chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The
  9479	archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and
  9480	for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador
  9481	took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to
  9482	him.
  9483	
  9484	Contrary to BilÃ­binâs forecast the news he had brought was joyfully
  9485	received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, KutÃºzov was awarded
  9486	the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards.
  9487	BolkÃ³nski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning
  9488	calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five
  9489	in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to
  9490	BilÃ­binâs house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle
  9491	and his visit to BrÃ¼nn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of
  9492	luggage. Franz, BilÃ­binâs man, was dragging a portmanteau with some
  9493	difficulty out of the front door.
  9494	
  9495	Before returning to BilÃ­binâs Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop
  9496	to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some
  9497	time in the shop.
  9498	
  9499	âWhat is it?â he asked.
  9500	
  9501	âOh, your excellency!â said Franz, with difficulty rolling the
  9502	portmanteau into the vehicle, âwe are to move on still farther. The
  9503	scoundrel is again at our heels!â
  9504	
  9505	âEh? What?â asked Prince Andrew.
  9506	
  9507	BilÃ­bin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.
  9508	
  9509	âThere now! Confess that this is delightful,â said he. âThis
  9510	affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without
  9511	striking a blow!â
  9512	
  9513	Prince Andrew could not understand.
  9514	
  9515	âBut where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the
  9516	town knows?â
  9517	
  9518	âI come from the archduchessâ. I heard nothing there.â
  9519	
  9520	âAnd you didnât see that everybody is packing up?â
  9521	
  9522	âI did not... What is it all about?â inquired Prince Andrew
  9523	impatiently.
  9524	
  9525	âWhatâs it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that
  9526	Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat
  9527	is now rushing along the road to BrÃ¼nn and will be here in a day or
  9528	two.â
  9529	
  9530	âWhat? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was
  9531	mined?â
  9532	
  9533	âThat is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.â
  9534	
  9535	BolkÃ³nski shrugged his shoulders.
  9536	
  9537	âBut if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It
  9538	will be cut off,â said he.
  9539	
  9540	âThatâs just it,â answered BilÃ­bin. âListen! The French entered
  9541	Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those
  9542	gentlemen, messieurs les marÃ©chaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard,
  9543	mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.)
  9544	âGentlemen,â says one of them, âyou know the Thabor Bridge is
  9545	mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its
  9546	head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up
  9547	the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the
  9548	Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take
  9549	it!â âYes, letâs!â say the others. And off they go and take the
  9550	bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the
  9551	Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.â
  9552	
  9553	    * The marshalls.
  9554	
  9555	âStop jesting,â said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news
  9556	grieved him and yet he was pleased.
  9557	
  9558	As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless
  9559	situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it
  9560	out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from
  9561	the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!
  9562	Listening to BilÃ­bin he was already imagining how on reaching the army
  9563	he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one
  9564	that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the
  9565	executing of the plan.
  9566	
  9567	âStop this jesting,â he said.
  9568	
  9569	âI am not jesting,â BilÃ­bin went on. âNothing is truer or sadder.
  9570	These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs;
  9571	they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on
  9572	their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the
  9573	tÃªte-de-pont. * They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that
  9574	the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with
  9575	Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The
  9576	officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack
  9577	jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to
  9578	the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into
  9579	the water, and approaches the tÃªte-de-pont. At length appears the
  9580	lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself.
  9581	âDearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars!
  9582	Hostilities are ended, we can shake one anotherâs hand.... The
  9583	Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auerspergâs
  9584	acquaintance.â In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so
  9585	bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly
  9586	established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the
  9587	sight of Muratâs mantle and ostrich plumes, quâil nây voit que du
  9588	feu, et oublie celui quâil devait faire faire sur lâennemi!â *(2)
  9589	In spite of the animation of his speech, BilÃ­bin did not forget to
  9590	pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. âThe
  9591	French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the
  9592	bridge is taken! But what is best of all,â he went on, his excitement
  9593	subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, âis that the
  9594	sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire
  9595	the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French
  9596	troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes
  9597	stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general,
  9598	goes up to Auersperg and says: âPrince, you are being deceived, here
  9599	are the French!â Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is
  9600	allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a
  9601	true Gascon) and says: âI donât recognize the world-famous Austrian
  9602	discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!â It
  9603	was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and
  9604	orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair
  9605	of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor
  9606	rascality....â
  9607	
  9608	     * Bridgehead.
  9609	
  9610	     * (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that
  9611	     he ought to be firing at the enemy.
  9612	
  9613	âIt may be treachery,â said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the
  9614	gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing,
  9615	and the glory that awaited him.
  9616	
  9617	âNot that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,â replied
  9618	BilÃ­bin. âItâs not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is
  9619	just as at Ulm... it is...ââhe seemed to be trying to find the right
  9620	expression. âCâest... câest du Mack. Nous sommes mackÃ©s (It is...
  9621	it is a bit of Mack. We are Macked),â he concluded, feeling that he
  9622	had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His
  9623	hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a
  9624	slight smile he began to examine his nails.
  9625	
  9626	âWhere are you off to?â he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had
  9627	risen and was going toward his room.
  9628	
  9629	âI am going away.â
  9630	
  9631	âWhere to?â
  9632	
  9633	âTo the army.â
  9634	
  9635	âBut you meant to stay another two days?â
  9636	
  9637	âBut now I am off at once.â
  9638	
  9639	And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to
  9640	his room.
  9641	
  9642	âDo you know, mon cher,â said BilÃ­bin following him, âI have been
  9643	thinking about you. Why are you going?â
  9644	
  9645	And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles
  9646	vanished from his face.
  9647	
  9648	Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.
  9649	
  9650	âWhy are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to
  9651	the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher, it is
  9652	heroism!â
  9653	
  9654	âNot at all,â said Prince Andrew.
  9655	
  9656	âBut as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other
  9657	side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary,
  9658	is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for
  9659	anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been
  9660	dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our
  9661	ill luck takes us. They say we are going to OlmÃ¼tz, and OlmÃ¼tz is a
  9662	very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my calÃ¨che.â
  9663	
  9664	âDo stop joking, BilÃ­bin,â cried BolkÃ³nski.
  9665	
  9666	âI am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are
  9667	you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two
  9668	things,â and the skin over his left temple puckered, âeither you
  9669	will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will
  9670	share defeat and disgrace with KutÃºzovâs whole army.â
  9671	
  9672	And BilÃ­bin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was
  9673	insoluble.
  9674	
  9675	âI cannot argue about it,â replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he
  9676	thought: âI am going to save the army.â
  9677	
  9678	âMy dear fellow, you are a hero!â said BilÃ­bin.
  9679	
  9680	
  9681	
  9682	
  9683	
  9684	CHAPTER XIII
  9685	
  9686	That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, BolkÃ³nski
  9687	set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and
  9688	fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.
  9689	
  9690	In BrÃ¼nn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy
  9691	baggage was already being dispatched to OlmÃ¼tz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince
  9692	Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with
  9693	great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed
  9694	with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew
  9695	took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and
  9696	weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the
  9697	commander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the
  9698	position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of
  9699	the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.
  9700	
  9701	âCette armÃ©e russe que lâor de lâAngleterre a transportÃ©e des
  9702	extrÃ©mitÃ©s de lâunivers, nous allons lui faire Ã©prouver le mÃªme
  9703	sortâ(le sort de lâarmÃ©e dâUlm).â * He remembered these words
  9704	in Bonaparteâs address to his army at the beginning of the campaign,
  9705	and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling
  9706	of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. âAnd should there be nothing
  9707	left but to die?â he thought. âWell, if need be, I shall do it no
  9708	worse than others.â
  9709	
  9710	     * âThat Russian army which has been brought from the ends of
  9711	     the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same
  9712	     fateâ(the fate of the army at Ulm).â
  9713	
  9714	
  9715	He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments,
  9716	carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all
  9717	kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and
  9718	sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear
  9719	could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts
  9720	and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the
  9721	urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers.
  9722	All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some
  9723	flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers
  9724	sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their
  9725	companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or
  9726	returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At
  9727	each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the
  9728	din of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud
  9729	pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,
  9730	traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers
  9731	directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their
  9732	voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces
  9733	that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.
  9734	
  9735	âHere is our dear Orthodox Russian army,â thought BolkÃ³nski,
  9736	recalling BilÃ­binâs words.
  9737	
  9738	Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to
  9739	a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle,
  9740	evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and
  9741	looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a calÃ¨che.
  9742	A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the
  9743	apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up
  9744	and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention
  9745	was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An
  9746	officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving
  9747	the womanâs vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes
  9748	of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed
  9749	piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron
  9750	and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:
  9751	
  9752	âMr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heavenâs sake... Protect
  9753	me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh
  9754	Chasseurs.... They wonât let us pass, we are left behind and have lost
  9755	our people...â
  9756	
  9757	âIâll flatten you into a pancake!â shouted the angry officer to
  9758	the soldier. âTurn back with your slut!â
  9759	
  9760	âMr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?â screamed the
  9761	doctorâs wife.
  9762	
  9763	âKindly let this cart pass. Donât you see itâs a woman?â said
  9764	Prince Andrew riding up to the officer.
  9765	
  9766	The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the
  9767	soldier. âIâll teach you to push on!... Back!â
  9768	
  9769	âLet them pass, I tell you!â repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his
  9770	lips.
  9771	
  9772	âAnd who are you?â cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy
  9773	rage, âwho are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here,
  9774	not you! Go back or Iâll flatten you into a pancake,â repeated he.
  9775	This expression evidently pleased him.
  9776	
  9777	âThat was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,â came a voice
  9778	from behind.
  9779	
  9780	Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,
  9781	tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his
  9782	championship of the doctorâs wife in her queer trap might expose him
  9783	to what he dreaded more than anything in the worldâto ridicule; but
  9784	his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence
  9785	Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised
  9786	his riding whip.
  9787	
  9788	âKind...ly letâthemâpass!â
  9789	
  9790	The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.
  9791	
  9792	âItâs all the fault of these fellows on the staff that thereâs
  9793	this disorder,â he muttered. âDo as you like.â
  9794	
  9795	Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
  9796	doctorâs wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with
  9797	a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he
  9798	galloped on to the village where he was told who the commander in chief
  9799	was.
  9800	
  9801	On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,
  9802	intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort
  9803	out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. âThis
  9804	is a mob of scoundrels and not an army,â he was thinking as he went
  9805	up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by
  9806	name.
  9807	
  9808	He turned round. NesvÃ­tskiâs handsome face looked out of the little
  9809	window. NesvÃ­tski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and
  9810	flourishing his arm, called him to enter.
  9811	
  9812	âBolkÃ³nski! BolkÃ³nski!... Donât you hear? Eh? Come quick...â he
  9813	shouted.
  9814	
  9815	Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw NesvÃ­tski and another adjutant
  9816	having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he
  9817	had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.
  9818	This was particularly noticeable on NesvÃ­tskiâs usually laughing
  9819	countenance.
  9820	
  9821	âWhere is the commander in chief?â asked BolkÃ³nski.
  9822	
  9823	âHere, in that house,â answered the adjutant.
  9824	
  9825	âWell, is it true that itâs peace and capitulation?â asked
  9826	NesvÃ­tski.
  9827	
  9828	âI was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could
  9829	do to get here.â
  9830	
  9831	âAnd we, my dear boy! Itâs terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,
  9832	weâre getting it still worse,â said NesvÃ­tski. âBut sit down and
  9833	have something to eat.â
  9834	
  9835	âYou wonât be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,
  9836	Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,â said the other
  9837	adjutant.
  9838	
  9839	âWhere are headquarters?â
  9840	
  9841	âWe are to spend the night in Znaim.â
  9842	
  9843	âWell, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,â said
  9844	NesvÃ­tski. âTheyâve made up splendid packs for meâfit to cross
  9845	the Bohemian mountains with. Itâs a bad lookout, old fellow! But
  9846	whatâs the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that,â he
  9847	added, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.
  9848	
  9849	âItâs nothing,â replied Prince Andrew.
  9850	
  9851	He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctorâs wife and
  9852	the convoy officer.
  9853	
  9854	âWhat is the commander in chief doing here?â he asked.
  9855	
  9856	âI canât make out at all,â said NesvÃ­tski.
  9857	
  9858	âWell, all I can make out is that everything is abominable,
  9859	abominable, quite abominable!â said Prince Andrew, and he went off to
  9860	the house where the commander in chief was.
  9861	
  9862	Passing by KutÃºzovâs carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of
  9863	his suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince
  9864	Andrew entered the passage. KutÃºzov himself, he was told, was in the
  9865	house with Prince BagratiÃ³n and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian
  9866	general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little KozlÃ³vski was
  9867	squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned
  9868	up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. KozlÃ³vskiâs
  9869	face looked wornâhe too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced
  9870	at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.
  9871	
  9872	âSecond line... have you written it?â he continued dictating to the
  9873	clerk. âThe Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...â
  9874	
  9875	âOne canât write so fast, your honor,â said the clerk, glancing
  9876	angrily and disrespectfully at KozlÃ³vski.
  9877	
  9878	Through the door came the sounds of KutÃºzovâs voice, excited and
  9879	dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the
  9880	sound of these voices, the inattentive way KozlÃ³vski looked at him, the
  9881	disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and
  9882	KozlÃ³vski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander
  9883	in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the
  9884	horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and
  9885	disastrous was about to happen.
  9886	
  9887	He turned to KozlÃ³vski with urgent questions.
  9888	
  9889	âImmediately, Prince,â said KozlÃ³vski. âDispositions for
  9890	BagratiÃ³n.â
  9891	
  9892	âWhat about capitulation?â
  9893	
  9894	âNothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.â
  9895	
  9896	Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.
  9897	Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and
  9898	KutÃºzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway.
  9899	Prince Andrew stood right in front of KutÃºzov but the expression of
  9900	the commander in chiefâs one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied
  9901	with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He
  9902	looked straight at his adjutantâs face without recognizing him.
  9903	
  9904	âWell, have you finished?â said he to KozlÃ³vski.
  9905	
  9906	âOne moment, your excellency.â
  9907	
  9908	BagratiÃ³n, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,
  9909	impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.
  9910	
  9911	âI have the honor to present myself,â repeated Prince Andrew rather
  9912	loudly, handing KutÃºzov an envelope.
  9913	
  9914	âAh, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!â
  9915	
  9916	KutÃºzov went out into the porch with BagratiÃ³n.
  9917	
  9918	âWell, good-by, Prince,â said he to BagratiÃ³n. âMy blessing, and
  9919	may Christ be with you in your great endeavor!â
  9920	
  9921	His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left
  9922	hand he drew BagratiÃ³n toward him, and with his right, on which he wore
  9923	a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently
  9924	habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but BagratiÃ³n kissed him on the
  9925	neck instead.
  9926	
  9927	âChrist be with you!â KutÃºzov repeated and went toward his
  9928	carriage. âGet in with me,â said he to BolkÃ³nski.
  9929	
  9930	âYour excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain
  9931	with Prince BagratiÃ³nâs detachment.â
  9932	
  9933	âGet in,â said KutÃºzov, and noticing that BolkÃ³nski still delayed,
  9934	he added: âI need good officers myself, need them myself!â
  9935	
  9936	They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.
  9937	
  9938	âThere is still much, much before us,â he said, as if with an old
  9939	manâs penetration he understood all that was passing in BolkÃ³nskiâs
  9940	mind. âIf a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,â
  9941	he added as if speaking to himself.
  9942	
  9943	Prince Andrew glanced at KutÃºzovâs face only a foot distant from him
  9944	and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near
  9945	his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty
  9946	eye socket. âYes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those menâs
  9947	death,â thought BolkÃ³nski.
  9948	
  9949	âThat is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,â he said.
  9950	
  9951	KutÃºzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been
  9952	saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying
  9953	on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew.
  9954	There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he
  9955	questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the
  9956	Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems
  9957	affair, and about some ladies they both knew.
  9958	
  9959	
  9960	
  9961	
  9962	
  9963	CHAPTER XIV
  9964	
  9965	On November 1 KutÃºzov had received, through a spy, news that the army
  9966	he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that
  9967	the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in
  9968	immense force upon KutÃºzovâs line of communication with the troops
  9969	that were arriving from Russia. If KutÃºzov decided to remain at Krems,
  9970	Napoleonâs army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him
  9971	off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he
  9972	would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If KutÃºzov decided
  9973	to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia,
  9974	he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian
  9975	mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and
  9976	abandoning all hope of a junction with BuxhÃ¶wden. If KutÃºzov decided
  9977	to retreat along the road from Krems to OlmÃ¼tz, to unite with the
  9978	troops arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road
  9979	by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his
  9980	baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march against an
  9981	enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.
  9982	
  9983	KutÃºzov chose this latter course.
  9984	
  9985	The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were
  9986	advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles
  9987	off on the line of KutÃºzovâs retreat. If he reached Znaim before the
  9988	French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the
  9989	French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a
  9990	disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall
  9991	the French with his whole army was impossible. The road for the French
  9992	from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the
  9993	Russians from Krems to Znaim.
  9994	
  9995	The night he received the news, KutÃºzov sent BagratiÃ³nâs vanguard,
  9996	four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim
  9997	to the Vienna-Znaim road. BagratiÃ³n was to make this march without
  9998	resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he
  9999	succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as
 10000	possible. KutÃºzov himself with all his transport took the road to
 10001	Znaim.
 10002	
 10003	Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his
 10004	hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers
 10005	by the way, BagratiÃ³n came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at HollabrÃ¼nn
 10006	a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching HollabrÃ¼nn from
 10007	Vienna. KutÃºzov with his transport had still to march for some days
 10008	before he could reach Znaim. Hence BagratiÃ³n with his four thousand
 10009	hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army
 10010	that came upon him at HollabrÃ¼nn, which was clearly impossible. But
 10011	a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick
 10012	that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without
 10013	a fight led Murat to try to deceive KutÃºzov in a similar way. Meeting
 10014	BagratiÃ³nâs weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be
 10015	KutÃºzovâs whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited
 10016	the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna,
 10017	and with this object offered a three daysâ truce on condition that
 10018	both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared
 10019	that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he
 10020	therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count
 10021	Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed
 10022	Muratâs emissary and retired, leaving BagratiÃ³nâs division
 10023	exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace
 10024	negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three daysâ truce.
 10025	BagratiÃ³n replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse
 10026	a truce and sent his adjutant to KutÃºzov to report the offer he had
 10027	received.
 10028	
 10029	A truce was KutÃºzovâs sole chance of gaining time, giving
 10030	BagratiÃ³nâs exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and
 10031	heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance
 10032	if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and
 10033	a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news
 10034	he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in
 10035	attendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely
 10036	to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and
 10037	meanwhile KutÃºzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the
 10038	movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim
 10039	road. BagratiÃ³nâs exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone
 10040	covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to
 10041	remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.
 10042	
 10043	KutÃºzovâs expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were
 10044	in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass,
 10045	and also that Muratâs mistake would very soon be discovered, proved
 10046	correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at SchÃ¶nbrunn, sixteen miles
 10047	from HollabrÃ¼nn) received Muratâs dispatch with the proposal of a
 10048	truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following
 10049	letter to Murat:
 10050	
 10051	SchÃ¶nbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,
 10052	
 10053	at eight oâclock in the morning
 10054	
 10055	To PRINCE MURAT,
 10056	
 10057	I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only
 10058	my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
 10059	order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break
 10060	the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the
 10061	general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no
 10062	one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.
 10063	
 10064	If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will
 10065	ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian
 10066	army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.
 10067	
 10068	The Russian Emperorâs aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are
 10069	nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians
 10070	let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are
 10071	letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.
 10072	
 10073	NAPOLEON
 10074	
 10075	Bonaparteâs adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to
 10076	Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all
 10077	the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim
 10078	escape, and BagratiÃ³nâs four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,
 10079	dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time
 10080	for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store
 10081	for him.
 10082	
 10083	
 10084	
 10085	
 10086	
 10087	CHAPTER XV
 10088	
 10089	Between three and four oâclock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who
 10090	had persisted in his request to KutÃºzov, arrived at Grunth and reported
 10091	himself to BagratiÃ³n. Bonaparteâs adjutant had not yet reached
 10092	Muratâs detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In BagratiÃ³nâs
 10093	detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They
 10094	talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked
 10095	of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement.
 10096	BagratiÃ³n, knowing BolkÃ³nski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant,
 10097	received him with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to
 10098	him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and
 10099	giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join
 10100	the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, âwhich is also
 10101	very important.â
 10102	
 10103	âHowever, there will hardly be an engagement today,â said BagratiÃ³n
 10104	as if to reassure Prince Andrew.
 10105	
 10106	âIf he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a
 10107	medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he
 10108	wishes to stay with me, let him... heâll be of use here if heâs a
 10109	brave officer,â thought BagratiÃ³n. Prince Andrew, without replying,
 10110	asked the princeâs permission to ride round the position to see the
 10111	disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent
 10112	to execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed
 10113	man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking
 10114	French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.
 10115	
 10116	On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who
 10117	seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches,
 10118	and fencing from the village.
 10119	
 10120	âThere now, Prince! We canât stop those fellows,â said the staff
 10121	officer pointing to the soldiers. âThe officers donât keep them in
 10122	hand. And there,â he pointed to a sutlerâs tent, âthey crowd in
 10123	and sit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, itâs full
 10124	again. I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It wonât take a
 10125	moment.â
 10126	
 10127	âYes, letâs go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,â
 10128	said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.
 10129	
 10130	âWhy didnât you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you
 10131	something.â
 10132	
 10133	They dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and
 10134	weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.
 10135	
 10136	âNow what does this mean, gentlemen?â said the staff officer, in
 10137	the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more
 10138	than once. âYou know it wonât do to leave your posts like this.
 10139	The prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you,
 10140	Captain,â and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who
 10141	without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry),
 10142	in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether
 10143	comfortably.
 10144	
 10145	âWell, arenât you ashamed of yourself, Captain TÃºshin?â he
 10146	continued. âOne would think that as an artillery officer you would set
 10147	a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be
 10148	sounded and youâll be in a pretty position without your boots!â (The
 10149	staff officer smiled.) âKindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of
 10150	you, all!â he added in a tone of command.
 10151	
 10152	Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer
 10153	TÃºshin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to
 10154	the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes
 10155	from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.
 10156	
 10157	âThe soldiers say it feels easier without boots,â said Captain
 10158	TÃºshin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing
 10159	to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his
 10160	jest was unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.
 10161	
 10162	âKindly return to your posts,â said the staff officer trying to
 10163	preserve his gravity.
 10164	
 10165	Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officerâs small figure.
 10166	There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic,
 10167	but extremely attractive.
 10168	
 10169	The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.
 10170	
 10171	Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking
 10172	soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some
 10173	entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up
 10174	red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite
 10175	the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants;
 10176	spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the
 10177	bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at
 10178	the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some
 10179	dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the
 10180	entrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a
 10181	trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.
 10182	
 10183	âVoilÃ  lâagrÃ©ment des camps, monsieur le prince,â * said the
 10184	staff officer.
 10185	
 10186	    * âThis is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.â
 10187	
 10188	
 10189	They rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be
 10190	seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.
 10191	
 10192	âThatâs our battery,â said the staff officer indicating the
 10193	highest point. âItâs in charge of the queer fellow we saw without
 10194	his boots. You can see everything from there; letâs go there,
 10195	Prince.â
 10196	
 10197	âThank you very much, I will go on alone,â said Prince Andrew,
 10198	wishing to rid himself of this staff officerâs company, âplease
 10199	donât trouble yourself further.â
 10200	
 10201	The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.
 10202	
 10203	The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and
 10204	cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been
 10205	in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven
 10206	miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm
 10207	could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the
 10208	more confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in
 10209	their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company
 10210	officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in
 10211	the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over
 10212	the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building
 10213	shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others,
 10214	dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending
 10215	boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers.
 10216	In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly
 10217	at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster
 10218	sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log
 10219	before his shelter, had been tasted.
 10220	
 10221	Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,
 10222	crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting
 10223	a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The
 10224	soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces,
 10225	emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from
 10226	the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and
 10227	wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were
 10228	as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful
 10229	encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in
 10230	which at least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a
 10231	chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiersâfine fellows
 10232	busy with similar peaceful affairsânear the shelter of the regimental
 10233	commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came
 10234	out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two
 10235	soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and
 10236	striking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally.
 10237	A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the
 10238	screams kept repeating:
 10239	
 10240	âItâs a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest,
 10241	honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in
 10242	him, heâs a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!â
 10243	
 10244	So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural
 10245	screams, continued.
 10246	
 10247	âGo on, go on!â said the major.
 10248	
 10249	A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
 10250	stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
 10251	as he rode by.
 10252	
 10253	Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front
 10254	line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks,
 10255	but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that
 10256	morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one
 10257	anotherâs faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who
 10258	formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers
 10259	who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.
 10260	
 10261	Since early morningâdespite an injunction not to approach the picket
 10262	lineâthe officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The
 10263	soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity,
 10264	no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and
 10265	grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look
 10266	at the French.
 10267	
 10268	âLook! Look there!â one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a
 10269	Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and
 10270	was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. âHark to him
 10271	jabbering! Fine, isnât it? Itâs all the Frenchy can do to keep up
 10272	with him. There now, SÃ­dorov!â
 10273	
 10274	âWait a bit and listen. Itâs fine!â answered SÃ­dorov, who was
 10275	considered an adept at French.
 10276	
 10277	The soldier to whom the laughers referred was DÃ³lokhov. Prince Andrew
 10278	recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. DÃ³lokhov
 10279	had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with
 10280	his captain.
 10281	
 10282	âNow then, go on, go on!â incited the officer, bending forward and
 10283	trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to
 10284	him. âMore, please: more! Whatâs he saying?â
 10285	
 10286	DÃ³lokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot
 10287	dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the
 10288	campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was
 10289	trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all
 10290	the way from Ulm, while DÃ³lokhov maintained that the Russians had not
 10291	surrendered but had beaten the French.
 10292	
 10293	âWe have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,â
 10294	said DÃ³lokhov.
 10295	
 10296	âOnly take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!â said
 10297	the French grenadier.
 10298	
 10299	The French onlookers and listeners laughed.
 10300	
 10301	âWeâll make you dance as we did under SuvÃ³rov...,â * said
 10302	DÃ³lokhov.
 10303	
 10304	    * âOn vous fera danser.â
 10305	
 10306	
 10307	âQuâ est-ce quâil chante?â * asked a Frenchman.
 10308	
 10309	    * âWhatâs he singing about?â
 10310	
 10311	
 10312	âItâs ancient history,â said another, guessing that it referred to
 10313	a former war. âThe Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the
 10314	others...â
 10315	
 10316	âBonaparte...â began DÃ³lokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.
 10317	
 10318	âNot Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! SacrÃ© nom...!â cried he angrily.
 10319	
 10320	âThe devil skin your Emperor.â
 10321	
 10322	And DÃ³lokhov swore at him in coarse soldierâs Russian and shouldering
 10323	his musket walked away.
 10324	
 10325	âLet us go, IvÃ¡n LukÃ­ch,â he said to the captain.
 10326	
 10327	âAh, thatâs the way to talk French,â said the picket soldiers.
 10328	âNow, SÃ­dorov, you have a try!â
 10329	
 10330	SÃ­dorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless
 10331	sounds very fast: âKari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, KaskÃ¡,â he said,
 10332	trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.
 10333	
 10334	âHo! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!â came peals of such healthy
 10335	and good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French
 10336	involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be
 10337	to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as
 10338	quickly as possible.
 10339	
 10340	But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and
 10341	entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon
 10342	confronted one another as before.
 10343	
 10344	
 10345	
 10346	
 10347	
 10348	CHAPTER XVI
 10349	
 10350	Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince
 10351	Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
 10352	told him the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped
 10353	beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an
 10354	artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the
 10355	officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.
 10356	Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes
 10357	and artillerymenâs bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest
 10358	cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the
 10359	sound of officersâ voices in eager conversation.
 10360	
 10361	It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the
 10362	greater part of the enemyâs opened out from this battery. Just facing
 10363	it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of SchÃ¶n Grabern
 10364	could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops
 10365	amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were
 10366	evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left from
 10367	that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it
 10368	was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was
 10369	posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position.
 10370	Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the
 10371	dragoons. In the center, where TÃºshinâs battery stood and from which
 10372	Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most
 10373	direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from SchÃ¶n
 10374	Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked
 10375	the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was
 10376	wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us
 10377	on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it
 10378	difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took
 10379	out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the
 10380	position. He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to
 10381	BagratiÃ³n. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the
 10382	center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the
 10383	dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely
 10384	following the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying
 10385	historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the
 10386	course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He
 10387	imagined only important possibilities: âIf the enemy attacks the right
 10388	flank,â he said to himself, âthe Kiev grenadiers and the PodÃ³lsk
 10389	chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center
 10390	come up. In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank
 10391	counterattack. If they attack our center we, having the center battery
 10392	on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and
 10393	retreat to the dip by echelons.â So he reasoned.... All the time
 10394	he had been beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers
 10395	distinctly, but as often happens had not understood a word of what they
 10396	were saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the
 10397	shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.
 10398	
 10399	âNo, friend,â said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a
 10400	familiar voice, âwhat I say is that if it were possible to know
 10401	what is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. Thatâs so,
 10402	friend.â
 10403	
 10404	Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: âAfraid or not, you canât
 10405	escape it anyhow.â
 10406	
 10407	âAll the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,â said a third
 10408	manly voice interrupting them both. âOf course you artillery men are
 10409	very wise, because you can take everything along with youâvodka and
 10410	snacks.â
 10411	
 10412	And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,
 10413	laughed.
 10414	
 10415	âYes, one is afraid,â continued the first speaker, he of the
 10416	familiar voice. âOne is afraid of the unknown, thatâs what it is.
 10417	Whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is
 10418	no sky but only an atmosphere.â
 10419	
 10420	The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.
 10421	
 10422	âWell, stand us some of your herb vodka, TÃºshin,â it said.
 10423	
 10424	âWhy,â thought Prince Andrew, âthatâs the captain who stood up
 10425	in the sutlerâs hut without his boots.â He recognized the agreeable,
 10426	philosophizing voice with pleasure.
 10427	
 10428	âSome herb vodka? Certainly!â said TÃºshin. âBut still, to
 10429	conceive a future life...â
 10430	
 10431	He did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and
 10432	nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it
 10433	had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near
 10434	the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground
 10435	seemed to groan at the terrible impact.
 10436	
 10437	And immediately TÃºshin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth
 10438	and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed
 10439	followed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who
 10440	hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.
 10441

 10445	
 10446	CHAPTER XVII
 10447	
 10448	Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery,
 10449	looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes
 10450	ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto
 10451	motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was
 10452	a battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two
 10453	mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A
 10454	small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,
 10455	probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had
 10456	not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report.
 10457	The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back
 10458	to Grunth to find Prince BagratiÃ³n. He heard the cannonade behind him
 10459	growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun to reply.
 10460	From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came
 10461	the report of musketry.
 10462	
 10463	Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparteâs stern letter,
 10464	and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once
 10465	moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian
 10466	wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to
 10467	crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.
 10468	
 10469	âIt has begun. Here it is!â thought Prince Andrew, feeling the
 10470	blood rush to his heart. âBut where and how will my Toulon present
 10471	itself?â
 10472	
 10473	Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking
 10474	vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid
 10475	movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready,
 10476	and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his
 10477	heart. âIt has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!â was what
 10478	the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.
 10479	
 10480	Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw,
 10481	in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him.
 10482	The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a
 10483	white horse, was Prince BagratiÃ³n. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for
 10484	him to come up; Prince BagratiÃ³n reined in his horse and recognizing
 10485	Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew
 10486	told him what he had seen.
 10487	
 10488	The feeling, âIt has begun! Here it is!â was seen even on Prince
 10489	BagratiÃ³nâs hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.
 10490	Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face
 10491	and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking
 10492	and feeling at that moment. âIs there anything at all behind that
 10493	impassive face?â Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince
 10494	BagratiÃ³n bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew
 10495	told him, and said, âVery good!â in a tone that seemed to imply that
 10496	everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he
 10497	had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke
 10498	quickly. Prince BagratiÃ³n, uttering his words with an Oriental accent,
 10499	spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no
 10500	need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction
 10501	of TÃºshinâs battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite. Behind
 10502	Prince BagratiÃ³n rode an officer of the suite, the princeâs personal
 10503	adjutant, ZherkÃ³v, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty,
 10504	riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilianâan accountant who had
 10505	asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity. The
 10506	accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around him with a naÃ¯ve
 10507	smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the
 10508	hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on
 10509	his horse with a convoy officerâs saddle.
 10510	
 10511	âHe wants to see a battle,â said ZherkÃ³v to BolkÃ³nski, pointing
 10512	to the accountant, âbut he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach
 10513	already.â
 10514	
 10515	âOh, leave off!â said the accountant with a beaming but rather
 10516	cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of ZherkÃ³vâs
 10517	joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.
 10518	
 10519	âIt is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,â said the staff officer.
 10520	(He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a
 10521	prince, but could not get it quite right.)
 10522	
 10523	By this time they were all approaching TÃºshinâs battery, and a ball
 10524	struck the ground in front of them.
 10525	
 10526	âWhatâs that that has fallen?â asked the accountant with a naÃ¯ve
 10527	smile.
 10528	
 10529	âA French pancake,â answered ZherkÃ³v.
 10530	
 10531	âSo thatâs what they hit with?â asked the accountant. âHow
 10532	awful!â
 10533	
 10534	He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking
 10535	when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly
 10536	ended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding
 10537	a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with
 10538	his horse. ZherkÃ³v and the staff officer bent over their saddles and
 10539	turned their horses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack,
 10540	and examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the
 10541	horse still struggled.
 10542	
 10543	Prince BagratiÃ³n screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the
 10544	cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say,
 10545	âIs it worth while noticing trifles?â He reined in his horse with
 10546	the care of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his
 10547	saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of
 10548	a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of
 10549	SuvÃ³rov giving his saber to BagratiÃ³n in Italy, and the recollection
 10550	was particularly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery
 10551	at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.
 10552	
 10553	âWhose company?â asked Prince BagratiÃ³n of an artilleryman standing
 10554	by the ammunition wagon.
 10555	
 10556	He asked, âWhose company?â but he really meant, âAre you
 10557	frightened here?â and the artilleryman understood him.
 10558	
 10559	âCaptain TÃºshinâs, your excellency!â shouted the red-haired,
 10560	freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.
 10561	
 10562	âYes, yes,â muttered BagratiÃ³n as if considering something, and he
 10563	rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.
 10564	
 10565	As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his
 10566	suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see
 10567	the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its
 10568	former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding
 10569	a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with
 10570	a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannonâs mouth. The short,
 10571	round-shouldered Captain TÃºshin, stumbling over the tail of the gun
 10572	carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out
 10573	shading his eyes with his small hand.
 10574	
 10575	âLift it two lines more and it will be just right,â cried he in a
 10576	feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to
 10577	his weak figure. âNumber Two!â he squeaked. âFire, MedvÃ©dev!â
 10578	
 10579	BagratiÃ³n called to him, and TÃºshin, raising three fingers to his cap
 10580	with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute
 10581	but like a priestâs benediction, approached the general. Though
 10582	TÃºshinâs guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was
 10583	firing incendiary balls at the village of SchÃ¶n Grabern visible just
 10584	opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.
 10585	
 10586	No one had given TÃºshin orders where and at what to fire, but after
 10587	consulting his sergeant major, ZakharchÃ©nko, for whom he had great
 10588	respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the
 10589	village. âVery good!â said BagratiÃ³n in reply to the officerâs
 10590	report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended
 10591	before him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the
 10592	height on which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the
 10593	rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was
 10594	heard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of
 10595	the suite pointed out to BagratiÃ³n a French column that was outflanking
 10596	us. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince
 10597	BagratiÃ³n ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to
 10598	reinforce the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark
 10599	to the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain
 10600	without support. Prince BagratiÃ³n turned to the officer and with his
 10601	dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the
 10602	officerâs remark was just and that really no answer could be made to
 10603	it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the
 10604	commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses
 10605	of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in
 10606	disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince BagratiÃ³n
 10607	bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to
 10608	the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the
 10609	French. But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that
 10610	the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in
 10611	the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing
 10612	men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the
 10613	wood.
 10614	
 10615	âVery good!â said BagratiÃ³n.
 10616	
 10617	As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and
 10618	as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
 10619	himself, Prince BagratiÃ³n sent ZherkÃ³v to tell the general in command
 10620	(the one who had paraded his regiment before KutÃºzov at Braunau) that
 10621	he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear,
 10622	as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemyâs
 10623	attack very long. About TÃºshin and the battalion that had been in
 10624	support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened
 10625	attentively to BagratiÃ³nâs colloquies with the commanding officers
 10626	and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders
 10627	were really given, but that Prince BagratiÃ³n tried to make it appear
 10628	that everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of
 10629	subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least
 10630	in accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that
 10631	though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the
 10632	commanderâs will, owing to the tact BagratiÃ³n showed, his presence
 10633	was very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed
 10634	countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew
 10635	more cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious to display
 10636	their courage before him.
 10637	
 10638	
 10639	
 10640	
 10641	
 10642	CHAPTER XVIII
 10643	
 10644	Prince BagratiÃ³n, having reached the highest point of our right flank,
 10645	began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where
 10646	on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to
 10647	the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness
 10648	of the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a
 10649	bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who
 10650	supported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he
 10651	was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or
 10652	mouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket,
 10653	groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while
 10654	blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had
 10655	that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering.
 10656	Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men
 10657	lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were
 10658	unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and
 10659	despite the generalâs presence were talking loudly and gesticulating.
 10660	In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
 10661	smoke, and an officer catching sight of BagratiÃ³n rushed shouting after
 10662	the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. BagratiÃ³n rode up
 10663	to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning
 10664	the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with
 10665	smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some
 10666	were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or
 10667	taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who
 10668	they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no
 10669	wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were
 10670	often heard. âWhat is this?â thought Prince Andrew approaching the
 10671	crowd of soldiers. âIt canât be an attack, for they are not moving;
 10672	it canât be a squareâfor they are not drawn up for that.â
 10673	
 10674	The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a
 10675	pleasant smileâhis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes,
 10676	giving him a mild expression, rode up to BagratiÃ³n and welcomed him as
 10677	a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had
 10678	been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been
 10679	repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack
 10680	had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had
 10681	occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what
 10682	had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and
 10683	could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his
 10684	regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement
 10685	of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
 10686	hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted âCavalry!â and
 10687	our men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry
 10688	which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the
 10689	hollow and were firing at our men. Prince BagratiÃ³n bowed his head as a
 10690	sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected. Turning
 10691	to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the
 10692	Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by
 10693	the changed expression on Prince BagratiÃ³nâs face at this moment. It
 10694	expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of
 10695	a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water.
 10696	The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation
 10697	of profound thought. The round, steady, hawkâs eyes looked before him
 10698	eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his
 10699	movements were still slow and measured.
 10700	
 10701	The commander of the regiment turned to Prince BagratiÃ³n, entreating
 10702	him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were.
 10703	âPlease, your excellency, for Godâs sake!â he kept saying,
 10704	glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away
 10705	from him. âThere, you see!â and he drew attention to the bullets
 10706	whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the
 10707	tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who
 10708	has picked up an ax: âWe are used to it, but you, sir, will blister
 10709	your hands.â He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his
 10710	half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The staff
 10711	officer joined in the colonelâs appeals, but BagratiÃ³n did not reply;
 10712	he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room
 10713	for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain
 10714	of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began
 10715	to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the
 10716	hill opposite, with the French moving about on it, opened out before
 10717	them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing
 10718	against them and winding down over the uneven ground. One could already
 10719	see the soldiersâ shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men,
 10720	and see the standard flapping against its staff.
 10721	
 10722	âThey march splendidly,â remarked someone in BagratiÃ³nâs suite.
 10723	
 10724	The head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash
 10725	would take place on this side of it...
 10726	
 10727	The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up
 10728	and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came
 10729	two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had
 10730	reached BagratiÃ³n, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in
 10731	step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to BagratiÃ³n, marched
 10732	a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy
 10733	expressionâthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that
 10734	moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he
 10735	would appear as he passed the commander.
 10736	
 10737	With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with
 10738	his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full
 10739	height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy
 10740	tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close
 10741	to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real
 10742	weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men
 10743	without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as
 10744	if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander
 10745	in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he
 10746	was happy. âLeft... left... left...â he seemed to repeat to himself
 10747	at each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied
 10748	faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched
 10749	in step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be
 10750	repeating to himself at each alternate step, âLeft... left...
 10751	left...â A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of
 10752	step; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his
 10753	defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon
 10754	ball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of BagratiÃ³n and his suite,
 10755	and fell into the column to the measure of âLeft... left!â âClose
 10756	up!â came the company commanderâs voice in jaunty tones. The
 10757	soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had
 10758	fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who
 10759	had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling
 10760	into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous
 10761	silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one
 10762	seemed to hear left... left... left.
 10763	
 10764	âWell done, lads!â said Prince BagratiÃ³n.
 10765	
 10766	âGlad to do our best, your exâlen-lency!â came a confused shout
 10767	from the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
 10768	BagratiÃ³n as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: âWe
 10769	know that ourselves!â Another, without looking round, as though
 10770	fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.
 10771	
 10772	The order was given to halt and down knapsacks.
 10773	
 10774	BagratiÃ³n rode round the ranks that had marched past him and
 10775	dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his
 10776	felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the
 10777	French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.
 10778	
 10779	âForward, with God!â said BagratiÃ³n, in a resolute, sonorous voice,
 10780	turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms,
 10781	he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of
 10782	a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him
 10783	forward, and experienced great happiness.
 10784	
 10785	The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside BagratiÃ³n,
 10786	could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their
 10787	faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered
 10788	legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince
 10789	BagratiÃ³n gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in
 10790	front of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the
 10791	French, smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots
 10792	sounded. Several of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer
 10793	who had marched so gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first
 10794	report was heard, BagratiÃ³n looked round and shouted, âHurrah!â
 10795	
 10796	âHurrahâah!âah!â rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and
 10797	passing BagratiÃ³n and racing one another they rushed in an irregular
 10798	but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.
 10799

 10803	
 10804	CHAPTER XIX
 10805	
 10806	The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right
 10807	flank. In the center TÃºshinâs forgotten battery, which had managed to
 10808	set fire to the SchÃ¶n Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The
 10809	French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus
 10810	gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side
 10811	of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the
 10812	different companies did not get mixed. But our leftâwhich consisted
 10813	of the AzÃ³v and PodÃ³lsk infantry and the PÃ¡vlograd hussarsâwas
 10814	simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under
 10815	Lannes and was thrown into confusion. BagratiÃ³n had sent ZherkÃ³v
 10816	to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat
 10817	immediately.
 10818	
 10819	ZherkÃ³v, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about
 10820	and galloped off. But no sooner had he left BagratiÃ³n than his courage
 10821	failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was
 10822	dangerous.
 10823	
 10824	Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the
 10825	firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they
 10826	could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.
 10827	
 10828	The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of
 10829	the regiment KutÃºzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which DÃ³lokhov was
 10830	serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had been
 10831	assigned to the commander of the PÃ¡vlograd regiment in which RostÃ³v
 10832	was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were much
 10833	exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on
 10834	the right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged
 10835	in discussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the
 10836	regiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the
 10837	impending action. From privates to general they were not expecting a
 10838	battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the
 10839	horses and the infantry collecting wood.
 10840	
 10841	âHe higher iss dan I in rank,â said the German colonel of the
 10842	hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, âso
 10843	let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars... Bugler,
 10844	sount ze retreat!â
 10845	
 10846	But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling
 10847	together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes
 10848	of Lannesâ sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and
 10849	forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in
 10850	command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and
 10851	having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the
 10852	PÃ¡vlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows but with
 10853	secret malevolence in their hearts.
 10854	
 10855	âOnce again, Colonel,â said the general, âI canât leave half
 10856	my men in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you,â he repeated, âto
 10857	occupy the position and prepare for an attack.â
 10858	
 10859	âI peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!â
 10860	suddenly replied the irate colonel. âIf you vere in the cavalry...â
 10861	
 10862	âI am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if
 10863	you are not aware of the fact...â
 10864	
 10865	âQuite avare, your excellency,â suddenly shouted the colonel,
 10866	touching his horse and turning purple in the face. âVill you be so
 10867	goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I donât
 10868	vish to destroy my men for your pleasure!â
 10869	
 10870	âYou forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure
 10871	and I wonât allow it to be said!â
 10872	
 10873	Taking the colonelâs outburst as a challenge to his courage, the
 10874	general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the
 10875	front line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the
 10876	bullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and
 10877	they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the
 10878	line, for from where they had been before it had been evident that it
 10879	was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground,
 10880	as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The general
 10881	and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two
 10882	fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs
 10883	of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As
 10884	there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for
 10885	it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire,
 10886	they would have remained there for a long time testing each otherâs
 10887	courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry
 10888	and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had
 10889	attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible
 10890	for the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from
 10891	the line of retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient the
 10892	position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through
 10893	for themselves.
 10894	
 10895	The squadron in which RostÃ³v was serving had scarcely time to mount
 10896	before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge,
 10897	there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that
 10898	terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearâresembling the line
 10899	separating the living from the deadâlay between them. All were
 10900	conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross
 10901	it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.
 10902	
 10903	The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put
 10904	to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having
 10905	his own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor
 10906	of an attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang
 10907	out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards.
 10908	Still no one moved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars
 10909	alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this
 10910	irresolution communicated itself to the men.
 10911	
 10912	âIf only they would be quick!â thought RostÃ³v, feeling that at last
 10913	the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
 10914	often heard from his fellow hussars.
 10915	
 10916	âFoâward, with God, lads!â rang out DenÃ­sovâs voice. âAt a
 10917	twot foâward!â
 10918	
 10919	The horsesâ croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the
 10920	reins and started of his own accord.
 10921	
 10922	Before him, on the right, RostÃ³v saw the front lines of his hussars and
 10923	still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but
 10924	took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.
 10925	
 10926	âFaster!â came the word of command, and RostÃ³v felt Rookâs flanks
 10927	drooping as he broke into a gallop.
 10928	
 10929	RostÃ³v anticipated his horseâs movements and became more and more
 10930	elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been
 10931	in the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleâand now he
 10932	had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but
 10933	everything was becoming more and more happy and animated. âOh, how I
 10934	will slash at him!â thought RostÃ³v, gripping the hilt of his saber.
 10935	
 10936	âHur-a-a-a-ah!â came a roar of voices. âLet anyone come my way
 10937	now,â thought RostÃ³v driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go
 10938	at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was
 10939	already visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep
 10940	over the squadron. RostÃ³v raised his saber, ready to strike, but at
 10941	that instant the trooper NikÃ­tenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away
 10942	from him, and RostÃ³v felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried
 10943	forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From
 10944	behind him BondarchÃºk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked
 10945	angrily at him. BondarchÃºkâs horse swerved and galloped past.
 10946	
 10947	âHow is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!â RostÃ³v
 10948	asked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a
 10949	field. Instead of the moving horses and hussarsâ backs, he saw nothing
 10950	before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There
 10951	was warm blood under his arm. âNo, I am wounded and the horse is
 10952	killed.â Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his
 10953	riderâs leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could
 10954	not rise. RostÃ³v also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache
 10955	having become entangled in the saddle. Where our men were, and where the
 10956	French, he did not know. There was no one near.
 10957	
 10958	Having disentangled his leg, he rose. âWhere, on which side, was now
 10959	the line that had so sharply divided the two armies?â he asked himself
 10960	and could not answer. âCan something bad have happened to me?â
 10961	he wondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something
 10962	superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if
 10963	it were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find
 10964	blood on it. âAh, here are people coming,â he thought joyfully,
 10965	seeing some men running toward him. âThey will help me!â In front
 10966	came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned,
 10967	and with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running
 10968	behind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In among the
 10969	hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar. He
 10970	was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.
 10971	
 10972	âIt must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will
 10973	take me too? Who are these men?â thought RostÃ³v, scarcely believing
 10974	his eyes. âCan they be French?â He looked at the approaching
 10975	Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get
 10976	at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful
 10977	that he could not believe his eyes. âWho are they? Why are they
 10978	running? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone
 10979	is so fond of?â He remembered his motherâs love for him, and his
 10980	familyâs, and his friendsâ, and the enemyâs intention to kill him
 10981	seemed impossible. âBut perhaps they may do it!â For more than ten
 10982	seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation.
 10983	The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so
 10984	close that the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited,
 10985	alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath,
 10986	and running so lightly, frightened RostÃ³v. He seized his pistol and,
 10987	instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his
 10988	might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of doubt
 10989	and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the
 10990	feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that
 10991	of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly
 10992	leaping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he
 10993	used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale,
 10994	young face to look back. A shudder of terror went through him: âNo,
 10995	better not look,â he thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced
 10996	round once more. The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked
 10997	round the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted
 10998	something loudly to a comrade farther back. RostÃ³v paused. âNo,
 10999	thereâs some mistake,â thought he. âThey canât have wanted to
 11000	kill me.â But at the same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if
 11001	a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could run no more. The
 11002	Frenchman also stopped and took aim. RostÃ³v closed his eyes and stooped
 11003	down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his
 11004	last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and
 11005	reached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.
 11006	
 11007	
 11008	
 11009	
 11010	
 11011	CHAPTER XX
 11012	
 11013	The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts
 11014	of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and
 11015	retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the
 11016	senseless cry, âCut off!â that is so terrible in battle, and that
 11017	word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.
 11018	
 11019	âSurrounded! Cut off? Weâre lost!â shouted the fugitives.
 11020	
 11021	The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general
 11022	realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the
 11023	thought that he, an exemplary officer of many yearsâ service who
 11024	had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters
 11025	for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the
 11026	recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above
 11027	all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, he
 11028	clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to
 11029	the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately
 11030	missed him. His one desire was to know what was happening and at any
 11031	cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he,
 11032	an exemplary officer of twenty-two yearsâ service, who had never been
 11033	censured, should not be held to blame.
 11034	
 11035	Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind
 11036	the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and
 11037	descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides
 11038	the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers
 11039	attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him,
 11040	continue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem
 11041	so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance
 11042	distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of
 11043	his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the
 11044	air, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate
 11045	of battles was evidently culminating in a panic.
 11046	
 11047	The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
 11048	powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that
 11049	moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent
 11050	reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian
 11051	sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was TimÃ³khinâs
 11052	company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having
 11053	lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly.
 11054	TimÃ³khin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such
 11055	a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination that, taken by
 11056	surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets and run. DÃ³lokhov,
 11057	running beside TimÃ³khin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was
 11058	the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar. Our
 11059	fugitives returned, the battalions re-formed, and the French who had
 11060	nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed. Our
 11061	reserve units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end. The
 11062	regimental commander and Major EkonÃ³mov had stopped beside a bridge,
 11063	letting the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up
 11064	and took hold of the commanderâs stirrup, almost leaning against him.
 11065	The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack
 11066	or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition
 11067	pouch was slung. He had an officerâs sword in his hand. The soldier
 11068	was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commanderâs face,
 11069	and his lips were smiling. Though the commander was occupied in giving
 11070	instructions to Major EkonÃ³mov, he could not help taking notice of the
 11071	soldier.
 11072	
 11073	âYour excellency, here are two trophies,â said DÃ³lokhov, pointing
 11074	to the French sword and pouch. âI have taken an officer prisoner. I
 11075	stopped the company.â DÃ³lokhov breathed heavily from weariness and
 11076	spoke in abrupt sentences. âThe whole company can bear witness. I beg
 11077	you will remember this, your excellency!â
 11078	
 11079	âAll right, all right,â replied the commander, and turned to Major
 11080	EkonÃ³mov.
 11081	
 11082	But DÃ³lokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his
 11083	head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.
 11084	
 11085	âA bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your
 11086	excellency!â
 11087	
 11088	
 11089	TÃºshinâs battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the
 11090	action did Prince BagratiÃ³n, still hearing the cannonade in the center,
 11091	send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order
 11092	the battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the supports attached
 11093	to TÃºshinâs battery had been moved away in the middle of the action
 11094	by someoneâs order, the battery had continued firing and was only not
 11095	captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone
 11096	could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended
 11097	guns. On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the
 11098	French to suppose that hereâin the centerâthe main Russian forces
 11099	were concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on
 11100	each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated
 11101	guns on the hillock.
 11102	
 11103	Soon after Prince BagratiÃ³n had left him, TÃºshin had succeeded in
 11104	setting fire to SchÃ¶n Grabern.
 11105	
 11106	âLook at them scurrying! Itâs burning! Just see the smoke! Fine!
 11107	Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!â exclaimed the artillerymen,
 11108	brightening up.
 11109	
 11110	All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the
 11111	direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers
 11112	cried at each shot: âFine! Thatâs good! Look at it... Grand!â The
 11113	fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns
 11114	that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge
 11115	for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village
 11116	and began firing them at TÃºshinâs battery.
 11117	
 11118	In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in
 11119	successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this
 11120	battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one
 11121	knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon
 11122	driverâs leg. Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished,
 11123	but only changed character. The horses were replaced by others from a
 11124	reserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns
 11125	were turned against the ten-gun battery. TÃºshinâs companion officer
 11126	had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour
 11127	seventeen of the forty men of the gunsâ crews had been disabled, but
 11128	the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they
 11129	noticed the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot
 11130	at them.
 11131	
 11132	Little TÃºshin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to
 11133	ârefill my pipe for that one!â and then, scattering sparks from it,
 11134	ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.
 11135	
 11136	âSmack at âem, lads!â he kept saying, seizing the guns by the
 11137	wheels and working the screws himself.
 11138	
 11139	Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him
 11140	jump, TÃºshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun,
 11141	now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing
 11142	dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his
 11143	feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and
 11144	more animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and
 11145	turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always
 11146	the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers,
 11147	for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an
 11148	artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad
 11149	as their officerâall looked at their commander like children in an
 11150	embarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably
 11151	reflected on theirs.
 11152	
 11153	Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
 11154	activity, TÃºshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of
 11155	fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never
 11156	occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It
 11157	seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he
 11158	had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner
 11159	of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he
 11160	thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the
 11161	best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to
 11162	feverish delirium or drunkenness.
 11163	
 11164	From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and
 11165	thud of the enemyâs cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring
 11166	faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood
 11167	of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemyâs side
 11168	(always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a
 11169	gun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of
 11170	his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded
 11171	him pleasure. The enemyâs guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes
 11172	from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.
 11173	
 11174	âThere... heâs puffing again,â muttered TÃºshin to himself, as a
 11175	small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by
 11176	the wind.
 11177	
 11178	âNow look out for the ball... weâll throw it back.â
 11179	
 11180	âWhat do you want, your honor?â asked an artilleryman, standing
 11181	close by, who heard him muttering.
 11182	
 11183	âNothing... only a shell...â he answered.
 11184	
 11185	âCome along, our MatvÃ©vna!â he said to himself. âMatvÃ©vnaâ *
 11186	was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which
 11187	was large and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns
 11188	seemed to him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One
 11189	of the second gunâs crew was âuncleâ; TÃºshin looked at him more
 11190	often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement.
 11191	The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now
 11192	increasing, seemed like someoneâs breathing. He listened intently to
 11193	the ebb and flow of these sounds.
 11194	
 11195	    * Daughter of Matthew.
 11196	
 11197	âAh! Breathing again, breathing!â he muttered to himself.
 11198	
 11199	He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing
 11200	cannon balls at the French with both hands.
 11201	
 11202	âNow then, MatvÃ©vna, dear old lady, donât let me down!â he was
 11203	saying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called
 11204	above his head: âCaptain TÃºshin! Captain!â
 11205	
 11206	TÃºshin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned
 11207	him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:
 11208	
 11209	âAre you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...â
 11210	
 11211	âWhy are they down on me?â thought TÃºshin, looking in alarm at his
 11212	superior.
 11213	
 11214	âI... donât...â he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap.
 11215	âI...â
 11216	
 11217	But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon
 11218	ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse.
 11219	He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball
 11220	stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.
 11221	
 11222	âRetire! All to retire!â he shouted from a distance.
 11223	
 11224	The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same
 11225	order.
 11226	
 11227	It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space
 11228	where TÃºshinâs guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a
 11229	broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses.
 11230	Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay
 11231	several dead men. One ball after another passed over as he approached
 11232	and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought
 11233	of being afraid roused him again. âI cannot be afraid,â thought he,
 11234	and dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the order and did
 11235	not leave the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their
 11236	positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together with TÃºshin, stepping
 11237	across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended
 11238	to the removal of the guns.
 11239	
 11240	âA staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,â said an
 11241	artilleryman to Prince Andrew. âNot like your honor!â
 11242	
 11243	Prince Andrew said nothing to TÃºshin. They were both so busy as to seem
 11244	not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon
 11245	that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill
 11246	(one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode
 11247	up to TÃºshin.
 11248	
 11249	âWell, till we meet again...â he said, holding out his hand to
 11250	TÃºshin.
 11251	
 11252	âGood-by, my dear fellow,â said TÃºshin. âDear soul! Good-by, my
 11253	dear fellow!â and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his
 11254	eyes.
 11255	
 11256	
 11257	
 11258	
 11259	
 11260	CHAPTER XXI
 11261	
 11262	The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke,
 11263	hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing
 11264	dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The
 11265	cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the
 11266	right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as TÃºshin with his guns,
 11267	continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range
 11268	of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff,
 11269	among them the staff officer and ZherkÃ³v, who had been twice sent to
 11270	TÃºshinâs battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one
 11271	another, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed,
 11272	reprimanding and reproaching him. TÃºshin gave no orders, and,
 11273	silentlyâfearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to
 11274	weep without knowing whyârode behind on his artillery nag. Though
 11275	the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves
 11276	after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty
 11277	infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of
 11278	TÃºshinâs wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on
 11279	âMatvÃ©vnaâsâ carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar
 11280	cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to TÃºshin and asked
 11281	for a seat.
 11282	
 11283	âCaptain, for Godâs sake! Iâve hurt my arm,â he said timidly.
 11284	âFor Godâs sake... I canât walk. For Godâs sake!â
 11285	
 11286	It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and
 11287	been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.
 11288	
 11289	âTell them to give me a seat, for Godâs sake!â
 11290	
 11291	âGive him a seat,â said TÃºshin. âLay a cloak for him to sit on,
 11292	lad,â he said, addressing his favorite soldier. âAnd where is the
 11293	wounded officer?â
 11294	
 11295	âHe has been set down. He died,â replied someone.
 11296	
 11297	âHelp him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,
 11298	AntÃ³nov.â
 11299	
 11300	The cadet was RostÃ³v. With one hand he supported the other; he was
 11301	pale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on
 11302	âMatvÃ©vna,â the gun from which they had removed the dead officer.
 11303	The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his
 11304	breeches and arm.
 11305	
 11306	âWhat, are you wounded, my lad?â said TÃºshin, approaching the gun
 11307	on which RostÃ³v sat.
 11308	
 11309	âNo, itâs a sprain.â
 11310	
 11311	âThen what is this blood on the gun carriage?â inquired TÃºshin.
 11312	
 11313	âIt was the officer, your honor, stained it,â answered the
 11314	artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if
 11315	apologizing for the state of his gun.
 11316	
 11317	It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the
 11318	infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It
 11319	had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces
 11320	off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the
 11321	right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in
 11322	the darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers
 11323	who had sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of
 11324	the village again, but TÃºshinâs guns could not move, and the
 11325	artillerymen, TÃºshin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they
 11326	awaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly,
 11327	streamed out of a side street.
 11328	
 11329	âNot hurt, PetrÃ³v?â asked one.
 11330	
 11331	âWeâve given it âem hot, mate! They wonât make another push
 11332	now,â said another.
 11333	
 11334	âYou couldnât see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows!
 11335	Nothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isnât there something to
 11336	drink?â
 11337	
 11338	The French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in
 11339	the complete darkness TÃºshinâs guns moved forward, surrounded by the
 11340	humming infantry as by a frame.
 11341	
 11342	In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing
 11343	always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of
 11344	hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the
 11345	wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness
 11346	of the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their
 11347	groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night.
 11348	After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on
 11349	a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing:
 11350	âWhat did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?â came
 11351	eager questions from all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing
 11352	closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt:
 11353	evidently those in front had halted. All remained where they were in the
 11354	middle of the muddy road.
 11355	
 11356	Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain TÃºshin,
 11357	having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing
 11358	station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the
 11359	soldiers had kindled on the road. RostÃ³v, too, dragged himself to the
 11360	fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole
 11361	body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by
 11362	an excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory
 11363	position. He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire,
 11364	which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered
 11365	figure of TÃºshin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him.
 11366	TÃºshinâs large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and
 11367	commiseration on RostÃ³v, who saw that TÃºshin with his whole heart
 11368	wished to help him but could not.
 11369	
 11370	From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who
 11371	were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound
 11372	of voices, the tramping feet, the horsesâ hoofs moving in mud, the
 11373	crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.
 11374	
 11375	It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the
 11376	gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.
 11377	RostÃ³v looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and
 11378	around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held
 11379	his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.
 11380	
 11381	âYou donât mind your honor?â he asked TÃºshin. âIâve lost my
 11382	company, your honor. I donât know where... such bad luck!â
 11383	
 11384	With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to
 11385	the bonfire, and addressing TÃºshin asked him to have the guns moved a
 11386	trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to
 11387	the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying
 11388	to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.
 11389	
 11390	âYou picked it up?... I dare say! Youâre very smart!â one of them
 11391	shouted hoarsely.
 11392	
 11393	Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
 11394	band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.
 11395	
 11396	âMust one die like a dog?â said he.
 11397	
 11398	TÃºshin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier
 11399	ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.
 11400	
 11401	âA nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow
 11402	countrymen. Thanks for the fireâweâll return it with interest,â
 11403	said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.
 11404	
 11405	Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed
 11406	by the fire. One of them stumbled.
 11407	
 11408	âWho the devil has put the logs on the road?â snarled he.
 11409	
 11410	âHeâs deadâwhy carry him?â said another.
 11411	
 11412	âShut up!â
 11413	
 11414	And they disappeared into the darkness with their load.
 11415	
 11416	âStill aching?â TÃºshin asked RostÃ³v in a whisper.
 11417	
 11418	âYes.â
 11419	
 11420	âYour honor, youâre wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,â
 11421	said a gunner, coming up to TÃºshin.
 11422	
 11423	âComing, friend.â
 11424	
 11425	TÃºshin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight,
 11426	walked away from the fire.
 11427	
 11428	Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared
 11429	for him, Prince BagratiÃ³n sat at dinner, talking with some commanding
 11430	officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with
 11431	the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the
 11432	general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a
 11433	glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet
 11434	ring, and ZherkÃ³v, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew,
 11435	pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes.
 11436	
 11437	In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and
 11438	the accountant with the naÃ¯ve face was feeling its texture, shaking his
 11439	head in perplexityâperhaps because the banner really interested him,
 11440	perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at
 11441	a dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut there was a
 11442	French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers
 11443	were flocking in to look at him. Prince BagratiÃ³n was thanking the
 11444	individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our
 11445	losses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was
 11446	informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn
 11447	from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the
 11448	French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and
 11449	had broken up the French troops.
 11450	
 11451	âWhen I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was
 11452	disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: âIâll let them
 11453	come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalionââand
 11454	thatâs what I did.â
 11455	
 11456	The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed
 11457	to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps
 11458	it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that
 11459	confusion what did or did not happen?
 11460	
 11461	âBy the way, your excellency, I should inform you,â he
 11462	continuedâremembering DÃ³lokhovâs conversation with KutÃºzov and his
 11463	last interview with the gentleman-rankerââthat Private DÃ³lokhov,
 11464	who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my
 11465	presence and particularly distinguished himself.â
 11466	
 11467	âI saw the PÃ¡vlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,â chimed
 11468	in ZherkÃ³v, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all
 11469	that day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. âThey
 11470	broke up two squares, your excellency.â
 11471	
 11472	Several of those present smiled at ZherkÃ³vâs words, expecting one of
 11473	his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to
 11474	the glory of our arms and of the dayâs work, they assumed a serious
 11475	expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie
 11476	devoid of any foundation. Prince BagratiÃ³n turned to the old colonel:
 11477	
 11478	âGentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically:
 11479	infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were
 11480	abandoned in the center?â he inquired, searching with his eyes for
 11481	someone. (Prince BagratiÃ³n did not ask about the guns on the left
 11482	flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very
 11483	beginning of the action.) âI think I sent you?â he added, turning to
 11484	the staff officer on duty.
 11485	
 11486	âOne was damaged,â answered the staff officer, âand the other I
 11487	canât understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only
 11488	just left.... It is true that it was hot there,â he added, modestly.
 11489	
 11490	Someone mentioned that Captain TÃºshin was bivouacking close to the
 11491	village and had already been sent for.
 11492	
 11493	âOh, but you were there?â said Prince BagratiÃ³n, addressing Prince
 11494	Andrew.
 11495	
 11496	âOf course, we only just missed one another,â said the staff
 11497	officer, with a smile to BolkÃ³nski.
 11498	
 11499	âI had not the pleasure of seeing you,â said Prince Andrew, coldly
 11500	and abruptly.
 11501	
 11502	All were silent. TÃºshin appeared at the threshold and made his way
 11503	timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the
 11504	generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the
 11505	sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and
 11506	stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.
 11507	
 11508	âHow was it a gun was abandoned?â asked BagratiÃ³n, frowning, not so
 11509	much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom ZherkÃ³v
 11510	laughed loudest.
 11511	
 11512	Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt
 11513	and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present
 11514	themselves to TÃºshin in all their horror. He had been so excited that
 11515	he had not thought about it until that moment. The officersâ laughter
 11516	confused him still more. He stood before BagratiÃ³n with his lower
 11517	jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: âI donât know... your
 11518	excellency... I had no men... your excellency.â
 11519	
 11520	âYou might have taken some from the covering troops.â
 11521	
 11522	TÃºshin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that
 11523	was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into
 11524	trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on BagratiÃ³n as a schoolboy who
 11525	has blundered looks at an examiner.
 11526	
 11527	The silence lasted some time. Prince BagratiÃ³n, apparently not wishing
 11528	to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to
 11529	intervene. Prince Andrew looked at TÃºshin from under his brows and his
 11530	fingers twitched nervously.
 11531	
 11532	âYour excellency!â Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt
 11533	voice, âyou were pleased to send me to Captain TÃºshinâs battery. I
 11534	went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two
 11535	guns smashed, and no supports at all.â
 11536	
 11537	Prince BagratiÃ³n and TÃºshin looked with equal intentness at
 11538	BolkÃ³nski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.
 11539	
 11540	âAnd, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,â he
 11541	continued, âwe owe todayâs success chiefly to the action of that
 11542	battery and the heroic endurance of Captain TÃºshin and his company,â
 11543	and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.
 11544	
 11545	Prince BagratiÃ³n looked at TÃºshin, evidently reluctant to show
 11546	distrust in BolkÃ³nskiâs emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully
 11547	to credit it, bent his head, and told TÃºshin that he could go. Prince
 11548	Andrew went out with him.
 11549	
 11550	âThank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!â said TÃºshin.
 11551	
 11552	Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt
 11553	sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.
 11554	
 11555	
 11556	âWho are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will
 11557	all this end?â thought RostÃ³v, looking at the changing shadows before
 11558	him. The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible
 11559	drowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the
 11560	impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged
 11561	with the physical pain. It was they, these soldiersâwounded and
 11562	unwoundedâit was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting
 11563	the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To
 11564	rid himself of them he closed his eyes.
 11565	
 11566	For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things
 11567	appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand,
 11568	SÃ³nyaâs thin little shoulders, NatÃ¡shaâs eyes and laughter,
 11569	DenÃ­sov with his voice and mustache, and TelyÃ¡nin and all that affair
 11570	with TelyÃ¡nin and BogdÃ¡nich. That affair was the same thing as this
 11571	soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier
 11572	that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and
 11573	always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but
 11574	they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hairâs breadth.
 11575	It would not acheâit would be wellâif only they did not pull it, but
 11576	it was impossible to get rid of them.
 11577	
 11578	He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less
 11579	than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were
 11580	fluttering in that light. TÃºshin had not returned, the doctor had not
 11581	come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at
 11582	the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.
 11583	
 11584	âNobody wants me!â thought RostÃ³v. âThere is no one to help me or
 11585	pity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.â He sighed
 11586	and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.
 11587	
 11588	âEh, is anything hurting you?â asked the soldier, shaking his shirt
 11589	out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and
 11590	added: âWhat a lot of men have been crippled todayâfrightful!â
 11591	
 11592	RostÃ³v did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes
 11593	fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm,
 11594	bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his
 11595	healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. âAnd why
 11596	did I come here?â he wondered.
 11597	
 11598	Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of
 11599	BagratiÃ³nâs detachment was reunited to KutÃºzovâs army.

 11611	CHAPTER I
 11612	
 11613	Prince VasÃ­li was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans.
 11614	Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He
 11615	was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had
 11616	become a habit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted
 11617	to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life,
 11618	were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the
 11619	circumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not merely one
 11620	or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves,
 11621	some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He
 11622	did not, for instance, say to himself: âThis man now has influence, I
 11623	must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special
 11624	grant.â Nor did he say to himself: âPierre is a rich man, I must
 11625	entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles
 11626	I need.â But when he came across a man of position his instinct
 11627	immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any
 11628	premeditation Prince VasÃ­li took the first opportunity to gain his
 11629	confidence, flatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his
 11630	request.
 11631	
 11632	He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as
 11633	Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of
 11634	Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to
 11635	Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness,
 11636	yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing,
 11637	Prince VasÃ­li did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had
 11638	he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural
 11639	and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both
 11640	above and below him in social standing. Something always drew him toward
 11641	those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in
 11642	seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.
 11643	
 11644	Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count BezÃºkhov and a rich man, felt
 11645	himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and
 11646	preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to
 11647	sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of
 11648	which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his
 11649	estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not
 11650	even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended
 11651	and grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different
 11652	peopleâbusinessmen, relations, and acquaintances alikeâwere all
 11653	disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering
 11654	manner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierreâs noble
 11655	qualities. He was always hearing such words as: âWith your remarkable
 11656	kindness,â or, âWith your excellent heart,â âYou are yourself so
 11657	honorable, Count,â or, âWere he as clever as you,â and so on,
 11658	till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and
 11659	extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it
 11660	had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent.
 11661	Even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently
 11662	unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate. The angry eldest
 11663	princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a dollâs,
 11664	had come into Pierreâs room after the funeral. With drooping eyes
 11665	and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past
 11666	misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for
 11667	anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received,
 11668	to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where
 11669	she had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at these
 11670	words. Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre
 11671	took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for.
 11672	From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began
 11673	knitting a striped scarf for him.
 11674	
 11675	âDo this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a
 11676	great deal from the deceased,â said Prince VasÃ­li to him, handing him
 11677	a deed to sign for the princessâ benefit.
 11678	
 11679	Prince VasÃ­li had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw
 11680	this boneâa bill for thirty thousand rublesâto the poor princess
 11681	that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of
 11682	the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess
 11683	grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate to him,
 11684	especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made
 11685	him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.
 11686	
 11687	It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it
 11688	would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could
 11689	not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had
 11690	no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He
 11691	was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful
 11692	intoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some important and
 11693	general movement; that something was constantly expected of him, that if
 11694	he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he
 11695	did this and that, all would be well; and he did what was demanded of
 11696	him, but still that happy result always remained in the future.
 11697	
 11698	More than anyone else, Prince VasÃ­li took possession of Pierreâs
 11699	affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of
 11700	Count BezÃºkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of
 11701	a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for
 11702	pityâs sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of
 11703	his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice
 11704	of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in
 11705	Moscow after the death of Count BezÃºkhov, he would call Pierre, or
 11706	go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of
 11707	weariness and assurance, as if he were adding every time: âYou know
 11708	I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that
 11709	I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I
 11710	propose is the only thing possible.â
 11711	
 11712	âWell, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,â said Prince
 11713	VasÃ­li one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierreâs elbow,
 11714	speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed
 11715	upon and could not now be altered. âWe start tomorrow and Iâm giving
 11716	you a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important business
 11717	here is now settled, and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is
 11718	something I have received from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and
 11719	you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of
 11720	the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open before you.â
 11721	
 11722	Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words
 11723	were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career,
 11724	wished to make some suggestion. But Prince VasÃ­li interrupted him in
 11725	the special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting
 11726	his speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was
 11727	needed.
 11728	
 11729	âMais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience,
 11730	and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of
 11731	being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it
 11732	up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when you get to
 11733	Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible
 11734	recollections.â Prince VasÃ­li sighed. âYes, yes, my boy. And my
 11735	valet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting,â he added.
 11736	âYou know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so
 11737	I have received what was due from the RyazÃ¡n estate and will keep it;
 11738	you wonât require it. Weâll go into the accounts later.â
 11739	
 11740	By âwhat was due from the RyazÃ¡n estateâ Prince VasÃ­li meant
 11741	several thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierreâs peasants,
 11742	which the prince had retained for himself.
 11743	
 11744	In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of
 11745	gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the
 11746	rank (for he did nothing), that Prince VasÃ­li had procured for him,
 11747	and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous
 11748	that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle,
 11749	and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never
 11750	attained.
 11751	
 11752	Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.
 11753	The Guards had gone to the front; DÃ³lokhov had been reduced to the
 11754	ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew
 11755	was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he
 11756	used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with
 11757	a friend older than himself and whom he respected. His whole time
 11758	was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince
 11759	VasÃ­liâs house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and
 11760	his beautiful daughter HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 11761	
 11762	Like the others, Anna PÃ¡vlovna SchÃ©rer showed Pierre the change of
 11763	attitude toward him that had taken place in society.
 11764	
 11765	Formerly in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs presence, Pierre had always felt that
 11766	what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that
 11767	remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became
 11768	foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyteâs
 11769	stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said
 11770	was charmant. Even if Anna PÃ¡vlovna did not say so, he could see that
 11771	she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty.
 11772	
 11773	In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna
 11774	PÃ¡vlovnaâs usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added:
 11775	âYou will find the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne here, whom it is always
 11776	delightful to see.â
 11777	
 11778	When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some
 11779	link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
 11780	HÃ©lÃ¨ne, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were
 11781	being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an
 11782	entertaining supposition.
 11783	
 11784	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs âAt Homeâ was like the former one, only the
 11785	novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a
 11786	diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the
 11787	Emperor Alexanderâs visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august
 11788	friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold
 11789	the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race. Anna PÃ¡vlovna
 11790	received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the
 11791	young manâs recent loss by the death of Count BezÃºkhov (everyone
 11792	constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly
 11793	afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her
 11794	melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention
 11795	of her most august Majesty the Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna. Pierre felt
 11796	flattered by this. Anna PÃ¡vlovna arranged the different groups in her
 11797	drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were
 11798	Prince VasÃ­li and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat.
 11799	Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former,
 11800	but Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâwho was in the excited condition of a commander on
 11801	a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which
 11802	there is hardly time to put in actionâseeing Pierre, touched his
 11803	sleeve with her finger, saying:
 11804	
 11805	âWait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.â
 11806	(She glanced at HÃ©lÃ¨ne and smiled at her.) âMy dear HÃ©lÃ¨ne, be
 11807	charitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for
 11808	ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count
 11809	who will not refuse to accompany you.â
 11810	
 11811	The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna PÃ¡vlovna detained Pierre, looking
 11812	as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.
 11813	
 11814	âIsnât she exquisite?â she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately
 11815	beauty as she glided away. âAnd how she carries herself! For so young
 11816	a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from
 11817	her heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men
 11818	would occupy a most brilliant position in society. Donât you think so?
 11819	I only wanted to know your opinion,â and Anna PÃ¡vlovna let Pierre go.
 11820	
 11821	Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 11822	perfection of manner. If he ever thought of HÃ©lÃ¨ne, it was just of
 11823	her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in
 11824	society.
 11825	
 11826	The old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed
 11827	desirous of hiding her adoration for HÃ©lÃ¨ne and inclined rather
 11828	to show her fear of Anna PÃ¡vlovna. She looked at her niece, as if
 11829	inquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna
 11830	PÃ¡vlovna again touched Pierreâs sleeve, saying: âI hope you wonât
 11831	say that it is dull in my house again,â and she glanced at HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 11832	
 11833	HÃ©lÃ¨ne smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the
 11834	possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt
 11835	coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see
 11836	HÃ©lÃ¨ne, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome
 11837	and the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation,
 11838	HÃ©lÃ¨ne turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave
 11839	to everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little
 11840	meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just
 11841	speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierreâs
 11842	father, Count BezÃºkhov, and showed them her own box. Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 11843	asked to see the portrait of the auntâs husband on the box lid.
 11844	
 11845	âThat is probably the work of Vinesse,â said Pierre, mentioning
 11846	a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the
 11847	snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.
 11848	
 11849	He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox,
 11850	passing it across HÃ©lÃ¨neâs back. HÃ©lÃ¨ne stooped forward to make
 11851	room, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening
 11852	parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at
 11853	front and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre,
 11854	was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive
 11855	the living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that
 11856	he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them. He was
 11857	conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the
 11858	creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see her marble beauty
 11859	forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body
 11860	only covered by her garments. And having once seen this he could not
 11861	help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once
 11862	seen through.
 11863	
 11864	âSo you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?â HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 11865	seemed to say. âYou had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a
 11866	woman who may belong to anyoneâto you too,â said her glance. And at
 11867	that moment Pierre felt that HÃ©lÃ¨ne not only could, but must, be his
 11868	wife, and that it could not be otherwise.
 11869	
 11870	He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the
 11871	altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not
 11872	even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why,
 11873	that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.
 11874	
 11875	Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see
 11876	her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every
 11877	day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more
 11878	than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the
 11879	mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has
 11880	once recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him.
 11881	She already had power over him, and between them there was no longer any
 11882	barrier except the barrier of his own will.
 11883	
 11884	âWell, I will leave you in your little corner,â came Anna
 11885	PÃ¡vlovnaâs voice, âI see you are all right there.â
 11886	
 11887	And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything
 11888	reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone
 11889	knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.
 11890	
 11891	A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna PÃ¡vlovna said
 11892	to him: âI hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?â
 11893	
 11894	This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and
 11895	Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house
 11896	done up.
 11897	
 11898	âThatâs a good thing, but donât move from Prince VasÃ­liâs. It
 11899	is good to have a friend like the prince,â she said, smiling at Prince
 11900	VasÃ­li. âI know something about that. Donât I? And you are still so
 11901	young. You need advice. Donât be angry with me for exercising an old
 11902	womanâs privilege.â
 11903	
 11904	She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have
 11905	mentioned their age. âIf you marry it will be a different thing,â
 11906	she continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at
 11907	HÃ©lÃ¨ne nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He
 11908	muttered something and colored.
 11909	
 11910	When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what
 11911	had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that
 11912	the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned
 11913	he had said absent-mindedly: âYes, sheâs good looking,â he had
 11914	understood that this woman might belong to him.
 11915	
 11916	âBut sheâs stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,â he thought.
 11917	âThere is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites
 11918	in me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her
 11919	and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that thatâs why
 11920	he was sent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince VasÃ­li is her
 11921	father... Itâs bad....â he reflected, but while he was thinking this
 11922	(the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was
 11923	conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking
 11924	of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his
 11925	wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all he had
 11926	thought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her not as the
 11927	daughter of Prince VasÃ­li, but visualized her whole body only veiled
 11928	by its gray dress. âBut no! Why did this thought never occur to me
 11929	before?â and again he told himself that it was impossible, that there
 11930	would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in
 11931	this marriage. He recalled her former words and looks and the words
 11932	and looks of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna
 11933	PÃ¡vlovnaâs words and looks when she spoke to him about his house,
 11934	recalled thousands of such hints from Prince VasÃ­li and others, and was
 11935	seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do
 11936	something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at
 11937	the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another
 11938	part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.
 11939	
 11940	
 11941	
 11942	
 11943	
 11944	CHAPTER II
 11945	
 11946	In November, 1805, Prince VasÃ­li had to go on a tour of inspection
 11947	in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to
 11948	visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole
 11949	where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas
 11950	BolkÃ³nski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that
 11951	rich old man. But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs,
 11952	Prince VasÃ­li had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had
 11953	latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince VasÃ­liâs house
 11954	where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in
 11955	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs presence (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed
 11956	to her.
 11957	
 11958	âThis is all very fine, but things must be settled,â said Prince
 11959	VasÃ­li to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that
 11960	Pierre who was under such obligations to him (âBut never mind thatâ)
 11961	was not behaving very well in this matter. âYouth, frivolity... well,
 11962	God be with him,â thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart,
 11963	âbut it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be
 11964	LÃ«lyaâs name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does
 11965	not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affairâyes, my
 11966	affair. I am her father.â
 11967	
 11968	Six weeks after Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs âAt Homeâ and after the sleepless
 11969	night when he had decided that to marry HÃ©lÃ¨ne would be a calamity and
 11970	that he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision,
 11971	had not left Prince VasÃ­liâs and felt with terror that in peopleâs
 11972	eyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was
 11973	impossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that he
 11974	could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible
 11975	thing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have
 11976	been able to free himself but that Prince VasÃ­li (who had rarely before
 11977	given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening
 11978	party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil
 11979	the general pleasure and disappoint everyoneâs expectation. Prince
 11980	VasÃ­li, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierreâs
 11981	hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his
 11982	wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: âTill
 11983	tomorrow,â or, âBe in to dinner or I shall not see you,â or, âI
 11984	am staying in for your sake,â and so on. And though Prince VasÃ­li,
 11985	when he stayed in (as he said) for Pierreâs sake, hardly exchanged a
 11986	couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him.
 11987	Every day he said to himself one and the same thing: âIt is time I
 11988	understood her and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken
 11989	before, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent
 11990	girl,â he sometimes said to himself âshe never makes a mistake,
 11991	never says anything stupid. She says little, but what she does say is
 11992	always clear and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was abashed and
 11993	is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!â He had often begun
 11994	to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always
 11995	answered him either by a brief but appropriate remarkâshowing that it
 11996	did not interest herâor by a silent look and smile which more palpably
 11997	than anything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in
 11998	regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.
 11999	
 12000	She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him
 12001	alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general
 12002	smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was
 12003	waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that
 12004	sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror
 12005	seized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during
 12006	that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to
 12007	that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: âWhat am I doing? I need
 12008	resolution. Can it be that I have none?â
 12009	
 12010	He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter
 12011	he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really
 12012	possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel
 12013	themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered
 12014	by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna
 12015	PÃ¡vlovnaâs, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire
 12016	paralyzed his will.
 12017	
 12018	On HÃ©lÃ¨neâs name day, a small party of just their own peopleâas
 12019	his wife saidâmet for supper at Prince VasÃ­liâs. All these friends
 12020	and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young
 12021	girl would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper.
 12022	Princess KurÃ¡gina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome,
 12023	was sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the
 12024	more important guestsâan old general and his wife, and Anna PÃ¡vlovna
 12025	SchÃ©rer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests,
 12026	and there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and HÃ©lÃ¨ne,
 12027	side by side. Prince VasÃ­li was not having any supper: he went round
 12028	the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of
 12029	the guests. To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark
 12030	except to Pierre and HÃ©lÃ¨ne, whose presence he seemed not to notice.
 12031	He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the
 12032	silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladiesâ toilets and the gold
 12033	and silver of the menâs epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved
 12034	round the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with
 12035	the animated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table, the
 12036	old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her
 12037	passionately, at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the
 12038	story of the misfortunes of some Mary VÃ­ktorovna or other. At the
 12039	center of the table, Prince VasÃ­li attracted everybodyâs attention.
 12040	With a facetious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last
 12041	Wednesdayâs meeting of the Imperial Council, at which SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch
 12042	VyazmÃ­tinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had
 12043	received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander
 12044	from the army to SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch, in which the Emperor said that he was
 12045	receiving from all sides declarations of the peopleâs loyalty, that
 12046	the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that
 12047	he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be
 12048	worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: âSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch,
 12049	From all sides reports reach me,â etc.
 12050	
 12051	âWell, and so he never got farther than: âSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­châ?â
 12052	asked one of the ladies.
 12053	
 12054	âExactly, not a hairâs breadth farther,â answered Prince VasÃ­li,
 12055	laughing, ââSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch... From all sides... From all sides...
 12056	SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch...â Poor VyazmÃ­tinov could not get any farther!
 12057	He began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered
 12058	âSergÃ©yâ he sobbed, âKuz-mÃ­-ch,â tears, and âFrom all
 12059	sidesâ was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And again
 12060	his handkerchief, and again: âSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch, From all sides,â...
 12061	and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.â
 12062	
 12063	âKuzmÃ­ch... From all sides... and then tears,â someone repeated
 12064	laughing.
 12065	
 12066	âDonât be unkind,â cried Anna PÃ¡vlovna from her end of the table
 12067	holding up a threatening finger. âHe is such a worthy and excellent
 12068	man, our dear VyazmÃ­tinov....â
 12069	
 12070	Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the
 12071	honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the
 12072	influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and
 12073	HÃ©lÃ¨ne sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a
 12074	suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing
 12075	to do with SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­châa smile of bashfulness at their own
 12076	feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much
 12077	as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, sautÃ©, and ices, and however they
 12078	avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as
 12079	they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave
 12080	that the story about SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch, the laughter, and the food
 12081	were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was
 12082	directed toâPierre and HÃ©lÃ¨ne. Prince VasÃ­li mimicked the sobbing
 12083	of SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his
 12084	daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said:
 12085	âYes... itâs getting on, it will all be settled today.â Anna
 12086	PÃ¡vlovna threatened him on behalf of âour dear VyazmÃ­tinov,â and
 12087	in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince VasÃ­li
 12088	read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughterâs
 12089	happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the
 12090	old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh
 12091	seemed to say: âYes, thereâs nothing left for you and me but to sip
 12092	sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to
 12093	be thus boldly, provocatively happy.â âAnd what nonsense all this is
 12094	that I am saying!â thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces
 12095	of the lovers. âThatâs happiness!â
 12096	
 12097	Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that
 12098	society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
 12099	and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling
 12100	dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter.
 12101	Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was
 12102	evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at
 12103	table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked
 12104	at the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne with her radiant face and at the red, broad,
 12105	and happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light
 12106	of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.
 12107	
 12108	Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and
 12109	embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.
 12110	He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and
 12111	then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot
 12112	unexpectedly through his mind.
 12113	
 12114	âSo it is all finished!â he thought. âAnd how has it all happened?
 12115	How quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself
 12116	alone, but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They are
 12117	all expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I
 12118	cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it
 12119	will certainly happen!â thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling
 12120	shoulders close to his eyes.
 12121	
 12122	Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it
 12123	awkward to attract everyoneâs attention and to be considered a
 12124	lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris
 12125	possessed of a Helen. âBut no doubt it always is and must be so!â
 12126	he consoled himself. âAnd besides, what have I done to bring it about?
 12127	How did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince VasÃ­li. Then there
 12128	was nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards
 12129	with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it
 12130	begin, when did it all come about?â And here he was sitting by her
 12131	side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her
 12132	breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly seem to him
 12133	that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was
 12134	why they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration
 12135	he would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good
 12136	fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a
 12137	second time. But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what
 12138	was said.
 12139	
 12140	âI am asking you when you last heard from BolkÃ³nski,â repeated
 12141	Prince VasÃ­li a third time. âHow absent-minded you are, my dear
 12142	fellow.â
 12143	
 12144	Prince VasÃ­li smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at
 12145	him and HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âWell, what of it, if you all know it?â thought
 12146	Pierre. âWhat of it? Itâs the truth!â and he himself smiled his
 12147	gentle childlike smile, and HÃ©lÃ¨ne smiled too.
 12148	
 12149	âWhen did you get the letter? Was it from OlmÃ¼tz?â repeated
 12150	Prince VasÃ­li, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a
 12151	dispute.
 12152	
 12153	âHow can one talk or think of such trifles?â thought Pierre.
 12154	
 12155	âYes, from OlmÃ¼tz,â he answered, with a sigh.
 12156	
 12157	After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the
 12158	drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave
 12159	of HÃ©lÃ¨ne. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important
 12160	occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away,
 12161	refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful
 12162	silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his
 12163	diplomatic career in comparison with Pierreâs happiness. The old
 12164	general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. âOh, the
 12165	old fool,â he thought. âThat Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne will be beautiful
 12166	still when sheâs fifty.â
 12167	
 12168	âI think I may congratulate you,â whispered Anna PÃ¡vlovna to the
 12169	old princess, kissing her soundly. âIf I hadnât this headache Iâd
 12170	have stayed longer.â
 12171	
 12172	The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her
 12173	daughterâs happiness.
 12174	
 12175	While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time
 12176	alone with HÃ©lÃ¨ne in the little drawing room where they were sitting.
 12177	He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her,
 12178	but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable,
 12179	but he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt
 12180	ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone elseâs place here
 12181	beside HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âThis happiness is not for you,â some inner voice
 12182	whispered to him. âThis happiness is for those who have not in them
 12183	what there is in you.â
 12184	
 12185	But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was
 12186	satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that
 12187	this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.
 12188	
 12189	Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in
 12190	the large drawing room. Prince VasÃ­li came up to Pierre with languid
 12191	footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince VasÃ­li gave
 12192	him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was
 12193	so strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of
 12194	severity changed, and he drew Pierreâs hand downwards, made him sit
 12195	down, and smiled affectionately.
 12196	
 12197	âWell, LÃ«lya?â he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and
 12198	addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to
 12199	parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince
 12200	VasÃ­li had only acquired by imitating other parents.
 12201	
 12202	And he again turned to Pierre.
 12203	
 12204	âSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­châFrom all sidesââ he said, unbuttoning the top
 12205	button of his waistcoat.
 12206	
 12207	Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
 12208	about SergÃ©y KuzmÃ­ch that interested Prince VasÃ­li just then, and
 12209	Prince VasÃ­li saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered
 12210	something and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was
 12211	disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world
 12212	touched Pierre: he looked at HÃ©lÃ¨ne and she too seemed disconcerted,
 12213	and her look seemed to say: âWell, it is your own fault.â
 12214	
 12215	âThe step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!â thought Pierre,
 12216	and he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about SergÃ©y
 12217	KuzmÃ­ch, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it
 12218	properly. HÃ©lÃ¨ne answered with a smile that she too had missed it.
 12219	
 12220	When Prince VasÃ­li returned to the drawing room, the princess, his
 12221	wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.
 12222	
 12223	âOf course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...â
 12224	
 12225	âMarriages are made in heaven,â replied the elderly lady.
 12226	
 12227	Prince VasÃ­li passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down
 12228	on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to
 12229	be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.
 12230	
 12231	âAline,â he said to his wife, âgo and see what they are about.â
 12232	
 12233	The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and
 12234	indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and
 12235	HÃ©lÃ¨ne still sat talking just as before.
 12236	
 12237	âStill the same,â she said to her husband.
 12238	
 12239	Prince VasÃ­li frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his
 12240	face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking
 12241	himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went
 12242	past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went
 12243	joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre
 12244	rose in alarm on seeing it.
 12245	
 12246	âThank God!â said Prince VasÃ­li. âMy wife has told me
 12247	everything!â (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his
 12248	daughter.)ââMy dear boy... LÃ«lya... I am very pleased.â (His
 12249	voice trembled.) âI loved your father... and she will make you a good
 12250	wife... God bless you!...â
 12251	
 12252	He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his
 12253	malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.
 12254	
 12255	âPrincess, come here!â he shouted.
 12256	
 12257	The old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using
 12258	her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful
 12259	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs hand several times. After a while they were left alone
 12260	again.
 12261	
 12262	âAll this had to be and could not be otherwise,â thought Pierre,
 12263	âso it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because
 12264	itâs definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.â Pierre
 12265	held the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful
 12266	bosom as it rose and fell.
 12267	
 12268	âHÃ©lÃ¨ne!â he said aloud and paused.
 12269	
 12270	âSomething special is always said in such cases,â he thought, but
 12271	could not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face.
 12272	She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.
 12273	
 12274	âOh, take those off... those...â she said, pointing to his
 12275	spectacles.
 12276	
 12277	Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have
 12278	from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and
 12279	inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but
 12280	with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his
 12281	lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,
 12282	unpleasantly excited expression.
 12283	
 12284	âIt is too late now, itâs done; besides I love her,â thought
 12285	Pierre.
 12286	
 12287	âJe vous aime!â * he said, remembering what has to be said at such
 12288	moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.
 12289	
 12290	    * âI love you.â
 12291	
 12292	
 12293	Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count BezÃºkhovâs
 12294	large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people
 12295	said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.
 12296	
 12297

 12301	CHAPTER III
 12302	
 12303	Old Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski received a letter from Prince VasÃ­li
 12304	in November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him
 12305	a visit. âI am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I
 12306	shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at
 12307	the same time, my honored benefactor,â wrote Prince VasÃ­li. âMy son
 12308	Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will
 12309	allow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his
 12310	father, he feels for you.â
 12311	
 12312	âIt seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are
 12313	coming to us of their own accord,â incautiously remarked the little
 12314	princess on hearing the news.
 12315	
 12316	Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.
 12317	
 12318	A fortnight after the letter Prince VasÃ­liâs servants came one
 12319	evening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.
 12320	
 12321	Old BolkÃ³nski had always had a poor opinion of Prince VasÃ­liâs
 12322	character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and
 12323	Alexander Prince VasÃ­li had risen to high position and honors. And now,
 12324	from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess,
 12325	he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into
 12326	a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned
 12327	him. On the day of Prince VasÃ­liâs arrival, Prince BolkÃ³nski was
 12328	particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad
 12329	temper because Prince VasÃ­li was coming, or whether his being in a bad
 12330	temper made him specially annoyed at Prince VasÃ­liâs visit, he was
 12331	in a bad temper, and in the morning TÃ­khon had already advised the
 12332	architect not to go to the prince with his report.
 12333	
 12334	âDo you hear how heâs walking?â said TÃ­khon, drawing the
 12335	architectâs attention to the sound of the princeâs footsteps.
 12336	âStepping flat on his heelsâwe know what that means....â
 12337	
 12338	However, at nine oâclock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable
 12339	collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day
 12340	before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the
 12341	habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still
 12342	visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the
 12343	soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince went
 12344	through the conservatories, the serfsâ quarters, and the outbuildings,
 12345	frowning and silent.
 12346	
 12347	âCan a sleigh pass?â he asked his overseer, a venerable man,
 12348	resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him
 12349	back to the house.
 12350	
 12351	âThe snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.â
 12352	
 12353	The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. âGod be
 12354	thanked,â thought the overseer, âthe storm has blown over!â
 12355	
 12356	âIt would have been hard to drive up, your honor,â he added. âI
 12357	heard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.â
 12358	
 12359	The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,
 12360	frowning.
 12361	
 12362	âWhat? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?â he said in
 12363	his shrill, harsh voice. âThe road is not swept for the princess my
 12364	daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!â
 12365	
 12366	âYour honor, I thought...â
 12367	
 12368	âYou thought!â shouted the prince, his words coming more and more
 12369	rapidly and indistinctly. âYou thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...
 12370	Iâll teach you to think!â and lifting his stick he swung it and
 12371	would have hit AlpÃ¡tych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively
 12372	avoided the blow. âThought... Blackguards...â shouted the prince
 12373	rapidly.
 12374	
 12375	But although AlpÃ¡tych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the
 12376	stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before
 12377	him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued
 12378	to shout: âBlackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!â did not
 12379	lift his stick again but hurried into the house.
 12380	
 12381	Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew
 12382	that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle
 12383	Bourienne with a radiant face that said: âI know nothing, I am the
 12384	same as usual,â and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast
 12385	eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions
 12386	she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not.
 12387	She thought: âIf I seem not to notice he will think that I do not
 12388	sympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will
 12389	say (as he has done before) that Iâm in the dumps.â
 12390	
 12391	The prince looked at his daughterâs frightened face and snorted.
 12392	
 12393	âFool... or dummy!â he muttered.
 12394	
 12395	âAnd the other one is not here. Theyâve been telling tales,â he
 12396	thoughtâreferring to the little princess who was not in the dining
 12397	room.
 12398	
 12399	âWhere is the princess?â he asked. âHiding?â
 12400	
 12401	âShe is not very well,â answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with
 12402	a bright smile, âso she wonât come down. It is natural in her
 12403	state.â
 12404	
 12405	âHm! Hm!â muttered the prince, sitting down.
 12406	
 12407	His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he
 12408	flung it away. TÃ­khon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little
 12409	princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
 12410	that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.
 12411	
 12412	âI am afraid for the baby,â she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:
 12413	âHeaven knows what a fright might do.â
 12414	
 12415	In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and
 12416	with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not
 12417	realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince
 12418	reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt
 12419	for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald
 12420	Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole
 12421	days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her
 12422	about the old prince and criticized him.
 12423	
 12424	âSo we are to have visitors, mon prince?â remarked Mademoiselle
 12425	Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. âHis
 12426	Excellency Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡gin and his son, I understand?â she
 12427	said inquiringly.
 12428	
 12429	âHm!âhis excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the
 12430	service,â said the prince disdainfully. âWhy his son is coming I
 12431	donât understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know.
 12432	I donât want him.â (He looked at his blushing daughter.) âAre you
 12433	unwell today? Eh? Afraid of the âministerâ as that idiot AlpÃ¡tych
 12434	called him this morning?â
 12435	
 12436	âNo, mon pÃ¨re.â
 12437	
 12438	Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice
 12439	of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the
 12440	conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and
 12441	after the soup the prince became more genial.
 12442	
 12443	After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess
 12444	was sitting at a small table, chattering with MÃ¡sha, her maid. She grew
 12445	pale on seeing her father-in-law.
 12446	
 12447	She was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks
 12448	had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.
 12449	
 12450	âYes, I feel a kind of oppression,â she said in reply to the
 12451	princeâs question as to how she felt.
 12452	
 12453	âDo you want anything?â
 12454	
 12455	âNo, merci, mon pÃ¨re.â
 12456	
 12457	âWell, all right, all right.â
 12458	
 12459	He left the room and went to the waiting room where AlpÃ¡tych stood with
 12460	bowed head.
 12461	
 12462	âHas the snow been shoveled back?â
 12463	
 12464	âYes, your excellency. Forgive me for heavenâs sake... It was only
 12465	my stupidity.â
 12466	
 12467	âAll right, all right,â interrupted the prince, and laughing his
 12468	unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for AlpÃ¡tych to kiss, and then
 12469	proceeded to his study.
 12470	
 12471	Prince VasÃ­li arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by
 12472	coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to
 12473	one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.
 12474	
 12475	Prince VasÃ­li and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.
 12476	
 12477	Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a
 12478	table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his
 12479	large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round
 12480	of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him.
 12481	And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly
 12482	heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well
 12483	and amusingly. âAnd why not marry her if she really has so much money?
 12484	That never does any harm,â thought Anatole.
 12485	
 12486	He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
 12487	become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his
 12488	fatherâs room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to
 12489	him. Prince VasÃ­liâs two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked
 12490	round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
 12491	entered, as if to say: âYes, thatâs how I want you to look.â
 12492	
 12493	âI say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?â Anatole asked,
 12494	as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been
 12495	mentioned during the journey.
 12496	
 12497	âEnough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious
 12498	with the old prince.â
 12499	
 12500	âIf he starts a row Iâll go away,â said Prince Anatole. âI
 12501	canât bear those old men! Eh?â
 12502	
 12503	âRemember, for you everything depends on this.â
 12504	
 12505	In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservantsâ rooms that
 12506	the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had
 12507	been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,
 12508	vainly trying to master her agitation.
 12509	
 12510	âWhy did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never
 12511	happen!â she said, looking at herself in the glass. âHow shall I
 12512	enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I canât now be myself with
 12513	him.â The mere thought of her fatherâs look filled her with terror.
 12514	The little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received
 12515	from MÃ¡sha, the ladyâs maid, the necessary report of how handsome the
 12516	ministerâs son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with
 12517	what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son
 12518	had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received
 12519	this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose
 12520	chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess
 12521	Maryâs room.
 12522	
 12523	âYou know theyâve come, Marie?â said the little princess, waddling
 12524	in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.
 12525	
 12526	She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,
 12527	but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her
 12528	face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded
 12529	outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still
 12530	more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch
 12531	had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienneâs toilet which rendered her
 12532	fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.
 12533	
 12534	âWhat! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?â she
 12535	began. âTheyâll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing
 12536	room and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself
 12537	up at all!â
 12538	
 12539	The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily
 12540	began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be
 12541	dressed. Princess Maryâs self-esteem was wounded by the fact that
 12542	the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both
 12543	her companionsâ not having the least conception that it could be
 12544	otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them
 12545	would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to
 12546	dress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her
 12547	beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took
 12548	on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she
 12549	submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these women
 12550	quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so plain that
 12551	neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing
 12552	her with perfect sincerity, and with the naÃ¯ve and firm conviction
 12553	women have that dress can make a face pretty.
 12554	
 12555	âNo really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,â said Lise, looking
 12556	sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. âYou have a maroon
 12557	dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may
 12558	be at stake. But this one is too light, itâs not becoming!â
 12559	
 12560	It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary
 12561	that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little
 12562	princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
 12563	in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on
 12564	the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that
 12565	the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that
 12566	however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it
 12567	would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three changes to
 12568	which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged
 12569	on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her
 12570	looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the
 12571	little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the
 12572	dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her
 12573	with her head bent first on one side and then on the other.
 12574	
 12575	âNo, it will not do,â she said decidedly, clasping her hands. âNo,
 12576	Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little
 12577	gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,â she said
 12578	to the maid, âbring the princess her gray dress, and youâll see,
 12579	Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,â she added, smiling
 12580	with a foretaste of artistic pleasure.
 12581	
 12582	But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained
 12583	sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the
 12584	mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst
 12585	into sobs.
 12586	
 12587	âCome, dear princess,â said Mademoiselle Bourienne, âjust one more
 12588	little effort.â
 12589	
 12590	The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess
 12591	Mary.
 12592	
 12593	âWell, now weâll arrange something quite simple and becoming,â she
 12594	said.
 12595	
 12596	The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienneâs, and Katieâs, who
 12597	was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping
 12598	of birds.
 12599	
 12600	âNo, leave me alone,â said Princess Mary.
 12601	
 12602	Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
 12603	was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful
 12604	eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at
 12605	them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.
 12606	
 12607	âAt least, change your coiffure,â said the little princess.
 12608	âDidnât I tell you,â she went on, turning reproachfully to
 12609	Mademoiselle Bourienne, âMaryâs is a face which such a coiffure does
 12610	not suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it.â
 12611	
 12612	âLeave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to
 12613	me,â answered a voice struggling with tears.
 12614	
 12615	Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves
 12616	that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual,
 12617	but it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they
 12618	both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess
 12619	Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they
 12620	knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to
 12621	be shaken in her determination.
 12622	
 12623	âYou will change it, wonât you?â said Lise. And as Princess Mary
 12624	gave no answer, she left the room.
 12625	
 12626	Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Liseâs request,
 12627	she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her
 12628	glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and
 12629	pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive
 12630	being rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different
 12631	happy world of his own. She fancied a child, her ownâsuch as she had
 12632	seen the day before in the arms of her nurseâs daughterâat her
 12633	own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
 12634	child. âBut no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,â she thought.
 12635	
 12636	âPlease come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,â came the
 12637	maidâs voice at the door.
 12638	
 12639	She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and
 12640	before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her
 12641	eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a
 12642	lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful
 12643	doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a
 12644	man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of
 12645	happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing
 12646	was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from
 12647	others and even from herself, the stronger it grew. âO God,â she
 12648	said, âhow am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil?
 12649	How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to
 12650	fulfill Thy will?â And scarcely had she put that question than God
 12651	gave her the answer in her own heart. âDesire nothing for thyself,
 12652	seek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Manâs future and thy own fate
 12653	must remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for
 12654	anything. If it be Godâs will to prove thee in the duties of marriage,
 12655	be ready to fulfill His will.â With this consoling thought (but
 12656	yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing)
 12657	Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking
 12658	neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what
 12659	she would say. What could all that matter in comparison with the will of
 12660	God, without Whose care not a hair of manâs head can fall?
 12661	
 12662	
 12663	
 12664	
 12665	
 12666	CHAPTER IV
 12667	
 12668	When Princess Mary came down, Prince VasÃ­li and his son were already
 12669	in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle
 12670	Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels,
 12671	the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess,
 12672	indicating her to the gentlemen, said: âVoilÃ  Marie!â Princess Mary
 12673	saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince VasÃ­liâs face,
 12674	serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling
 12675	again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression
 12676	âMarieâ produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle
 12677	Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated
 12678	look which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw
 12679	something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she
 12680	entered the room. Prince VasÃ­li approached first, and she kissed the
 12681	bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by
 12682	saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well. Then
 12683	Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a
 12684	soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white
 12685	forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade.
 12686	When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood
 12687	with his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded
 12688	and his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a
 12689	little bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without
 12690	speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not
 12691	quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the
 12692	faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable
 12693	self-possession. If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on
 12694	a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of
 12695	such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is
 12696	bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the
 12697	princessâ hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for
 12698	a very long time. âIf anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him
 12699	talk, but I donât want to,â he seemed to say. Besides this, in his
 12700	behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in
 12701	them curiosity, awe, and even loveâa supercilious consciousness of
 12702	his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: âI know you, I know
 12703	you, but why should I bother about you? Youâd be only too glad, of
 12704	course.â Perhaps he did not really think this when he met womenâeven
 12705	probably he did not, for in general he thought very littleâbut his
 12706	looks and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if
 12707	wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him,
 12708	she turned to his father. The conversation was general and animated,
 12709	thanks to Princess Liseâs voice and little downy lip that lifted over
 12710	her white teeth. She met Prince VasÃ­li with that playful manner often
 12711	employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption
 12712	that between the person they so address and themselves there are some
 12713	semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though
 12714	no such reminiscences really existâjust as none existed in this case.
 12715	Prince VasÃ­li readily adopted her tone and the little princess also
 12716	drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of
 12717	things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them
 12718	and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these
 12719	merry reminiscences.
 12720	
 12721	âHere at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to
 12722	ourselves, dear prince,â said the little princess (of course, in
 12723	French) to Prince VasÃ­li. âItâs not as at Annetteâs * receptions
 12724	where you always ran away; you remember cette chÃ¨re Annette!â
 12725	
 12726	    * Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 12727	
 12728	âAh, but you wonât talk politics to me like Annette!â
 12729	
 12730	âAnd our little tea table?â
 12731	
 12732	âOh, yes!â
 12733	
 12734	âWhy is it you were never at Annetteâs?â the little princess asked
 12735	Anatole. âAh, I know, I know,â she said with a sly glance, âyour
 12736	brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!â and she shook her
 12737	finger at him, âI have even heard of your doings in Paris!â
 12738	
 12739	âAnd didnât Hippolyte tell you?â asked Prince VasÃ­li, turning to
 12740	his son and seizing the little princessâ arm as if she would have run
 12741	away and he had just managed to catch her, âdidnât he tell you how
 12742	he himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the
 12743	door? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess,â he added, turning to
 12744	Princess Mary.
 12745	
 12746	When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the
 12747	opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.
 12748	
 12749	She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole
 12750	had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the
 12751	Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her
 12752	about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole
 12753	came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either.
 12754	âNot at all bad!â he thought, examining her, ânot at all bad, that
 12755	little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when weâre
 12756	married, la petite est gentille.â *
 12757	
 12758	    * The little one is charming.
 12759	
 12760	The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering
 12761	what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. âWhat are
 12762	Prince VasÃ­li and that son of his to me? Prince VasÃ­li is a shallow
 12763	braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,â he grumbled to
 12764	himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived
 12765	in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about
 12766	which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever
 12767	bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The
 12768	prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand
 12769	that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only
 12770	with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without
 12771	Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to
 12772	him. âAnd why should she marry?â he thought. âTo be unhappy for
 12773	certain. Thereâs Lise, married to Andrewâa better husband one would
 12774	think could hardly be found nowadaysâbut is she contented with her
 12775	lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! Theyâll
 12776	take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living
 12777	unmarried, and even the happier for it?â So thought Prince BolkÃ³nski
 12778	while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded
 12779	an immediate answer. Prince VasÃ­li had brought his son with the evident
 12780	intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask
 12781	for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. âWell,
 12782	Iâve nothing against it,â the prince said to himself, âbut he must
 12783	be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.â
 12784	
 12785	âThat is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!â he added
 12786	aloud.
 12787	
 12788	He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly
 12789	round the company. He noticed the change in the little princessâ
 12790	dress, Mademoiselle Bourienneâs ribbon, Princess Maryâs unbecoming
 12791	coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienneâs and Anatoleâs smiles, and the
 12792	loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. âGot herself
 12793	up like a fool!â he thought, looking irritably at her. âShe is
 12794	shameless, and he ignores her!â
 12795	
 12796	He went straight up to Prince VasÃ­li.
 12797	
 12798	âWell! How dâye do? How dâye do? Glad to see you!â
 12799	
 12800	âFriendship laughs at distance,â began Prince VasÃ­li in his usual
 12801	rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. âHere is my second son; please
 12802	love and befriend him.â
 12803	
 12804	Prince BolkÃ³nski surveyed Anatole.
 12805	
 12806	âFine young fellow! Fine young fellow!â he said. âWell, come and
 12807	kiss me,â and he offered his cheek.
 12808	
 12809	Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect
 12810	composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had
 12811	told him to expect.
 12812	
 12813	Prince BolkÃ³nski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa
 12814	and, drawing up an armchair for Prince VasÃ­li, pointed to it and began
 12815	questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen
 12816	attentively to what Prince VasÃ­li said, but kept glancing at Princess
 12817	Mary.
 12818	
 12819	âAnd so they are writing from Potsdam already?â he said, repeating
 12820	Prince VasÃ­liâs last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his
 12821	daughter.
 12822	
 12823	âIs it for visitors youâve got yourself up like that, eh?â said
 12824	he. âFine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for
 12825	the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are
 12826	never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.â
 12827	
 12828	âIt was my fault, mon pÃ¨re,â interceded the little princess, with a
 12829	blush.
 12830	
 12831	âYou must do as you please,â said Prince BolkÃ³nski, bowing to his
 12832	daughter-in-law, âbut she need not make a fool of herself, sheâs
 12833	plain enough as it is.â
 12834	
 12835	And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was
 12836	reduced to tears.
 12837	
 12838	âOn the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,â said
 12839	Prince VasÃ­li.
 12840	
 12841	âNow you, young prince, whatâs your name?â said Prince BolkÃ³nski,
 12842	turning to Anatole, âcome here, let us talk and get acquainted.â
 12843	
 12844	âNow the fun begins,â thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile
 12845	beside the old prince.
 12846	
 12847	âWell, my dear boy, I hear youâve been educated abroad, not taught
 12848	to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me,
 12849	my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?â asked the old man,
 12850	scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.
 12851	
 12852	âNo, I have been transferred to the line,â said Anatole, hardly able
 12853	to restrain his laughter.
 12854	
 12855	âAh! Thatâs a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the
 12856	Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve.
 12857	Well, are you off to the front?â
 12858	
 12859	âNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached...
 12860	what is it I am attached to, Papa?â said Anatole, turning to his
 12861	father with a laugh.
 12862	
 12863	âA splendid soldier, splendid! âWhat am I attached to!â Ha, ha,
 12864	ha!â laughed Prince BolkÃ³nski, and Anatole laughed still louder.
 12865	Suddenly Prince BolkÃ³nski frowned.
 12866	
 12867	âYou may go,â he said to Anatole.
 12868	
 12869	Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.
 12870	
 12871	âAnd so youâve had him educated abroad, Prince VasÃ­li, havenât
 12872	you?â said the old prince to Prince VasÃ­li.
 12873	
 12874	âI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there
 12875	is much better than ours.â
 12876	
 12877	âYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The
 12878	ladâs a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.â He took
 12879	Prince VasÃ­liâs arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were
 12880	alone together, Prince VasÃ­li announced his hopes and wishes to the old
 12881	prince.
 12882	
 12883	âWell, do you think I shall prevent her, that I canât part from
 12884	her?â said the old prince angrily. âWhat an idea! Iâm ready for it
 12885	tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You
 12886	know my principlesâeverything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in
 12887	your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and
 12888	Iâll see.â The old prince snorted. âLet her marry, itâs all the
 12889	same to me!â he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting
 12890	from his son.
 12891	
 12892	âI will tell you frankly,â said Prince VasÃ­li in the tone of
 12893	a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so
 12894	keen-sighted a companion. âYou know, you see right through people.
 12895	Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent
 12896	son or kinsman.â
 12897	
 12898	âAll right, all right, weâll see!â
 12899	
 12900	As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time
 12901	without male society, on Anatoleâs appearance all the three women of
 12902	Prince BolkÃ³nskiâs household felt that their life had not been real
 12903	till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately
 12904	increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in
 12905	darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.
 12906	
 12907	Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The
 12908	handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed
 12909	all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and
 12910	magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future
 12911	family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and
 12912	tried to conceal them.
 12913	
 12914	âBut am I not too cold with him?â thought the princess. âI try
 12915	to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him
 12916	already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine
 12917	that I do not like him.â
 12918	
 12919	And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new
 12920	guest. âPoor girl, sheâs devilish ugly!â thought Anatole.
 12921	
 12922	Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatoleâs
 12923	arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman
 12924	without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did
 12925	not intend to devote her life to serving Prince BolkÃ³nski, to reading
 12926	aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle
 12927	Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to
 12928	appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed,
 12929	ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her
 12930	off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew
 12931	a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she
 12932	liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been
 12933	seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mÃ¨re) appeared, and
 12934	reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle
 12935	Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this
 12936	story to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had
 12937	appeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mÃ¨re would appear
 12938	and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle
 12939	Bourienneâs head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about
 12940	Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a
 12941	moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar
 12942	to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around
 12943	him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.
 12944	
 12945	The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,
 12946	unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the
 12947	familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any
 12948	struggle, but with naÃ¯ve and lighthearted gaiety.
 12949	
 12950	Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man
 12951	tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the
 12952	spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was
 12953	beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne
 12954	that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great
 12955	suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.
 12956	
 12957	After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was
 12958	asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits,
 12959	came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle
 12960	Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.
 12961	Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and
 12962	the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But
 12963	Anatoleâs expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not
 12964	to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienneâs little
 12965	foot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord.
 12966	Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her
 12967	lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new
 12968	to the princess.
 12969	
 12970	âHow she loves me!â thought Princess Mary. âHow happy I am now,
 12971	and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband?
 12972	Can it be possible?â she thought, not daring to look at his face, but
 12973	still feeling his eyes gazing at her.
 12974	
 12975	In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole
 12976	kissed Princess Maryâs hand. She did not know how she found the
 12977	courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near
 12978	to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and
 12979	kissed Mademoiselle Bourienneâs hand. (This was not etiquette, but
 12980	then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle
 12981	Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.
 12982	
 12983	âWhat delicacy!â thought the princess. âIs it possible that
 12984	AmÃ©lieâ (Mademoiselle Bourienne) âthinks I could be jealous of her,
 12985	and not value her pure affection and devotion to me?â She went up
 12986	to her and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little
 12987	princessâ hand.
 12988	
 12989	âNo! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
 12990	well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!â she said. And
 12991	smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.
 12992	
 12993	
 12994	
 12995	
 12996	
 12997	CHAPTER V
 12998	
 12999	They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he
 13000	got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.
 13001	
 13002	âIs he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kindâyes,
 13003	kind, that is the chief thing,â thought Princess Mary; and fear, which
 13004	she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it
 13005	seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the
 13006	dark corner. And this someone was heâthe devilâand he was also this
 13007	man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.
 13008	
 13009	She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.
 13010	
 13011	Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long
 13012	time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now
 13013	working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mÃ¨re
 13014	rebuking her for her fall.
 13015	
 13016	The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made.
 13017	She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was
 13018	awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than
 13019	ever because Anatoleâs presence had vividly recalled to her the time
 13020	when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She
 13021	sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy
 13022	and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third
 13023	time, muttering to herself.
 13024	
 13025	âI told you it was all lumps and holes!â the little princess
 13026	repeated. âI should be glad enough to fall asleep, so itâs not my
 13027	fault!â and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.
 13028	
 13029	The old prince did not sleep either. TÃ­khon, half asleep, heard him
 13030	pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he
 13031	had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed
 13032	because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he
 13033	loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider
 13034	the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but
 13035	instead of that he only excited himself more and more.
 13036	
 13037	âThe first man that turns upâshe forgets her father and everything
 13038	else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike
 13039	herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice
 13040	it. Fr... fr... fr! And donât I see that that idiot had eyes only for
 13041	BourienneâI shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not
 13042	pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at
 13043	least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks
 13044	nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but
 13045	Iâll let her see....â
 13046	
 13047	The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
 13048	mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne,
 13049	Princess Maryâs self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to
 13050	be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this
 13051	thought, he called TÃ­khon and began to undress.
 13052	
 13053	âWhat devil brought them here?â thought he, while TÃ­khon was
 13054	putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest.
 13055	âI never invited them. They came to disturb my lifeâand there is not
 13056	much of it left.â
 13057	
 13058	âDevil take âem!â he muttered, while his head was still covered by
 13059	the shirt.
 13060	
 13061	TÃ­khon knew his masterâs habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and
 13062	therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of
 13063	the face that emerged from the shirt.
 13064	
 13065	âGone to bed?â asked the prince.
 13066	
 13067	TÃ­khon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his
 13068	masterâs thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince
 13069	VasÃ­li and his son.
 13070	
 13071	âThey have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.â
 13072	
 13073	âNo good... no good...â said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his
 13074	feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing
 13075	gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.
 13076	
 13077	Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne,
 13078	they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance,
 13079	up to the appearance of the pauvre mÃ¨re; they understood that they had
 13080	much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
 13081	opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary
 13082	went to her fatherâs room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne
 13083	and Anatole met in the conservatory.
 13084	
 13085	Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation.
 13086	It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be
 13087	decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She
 13088	read this in TÃ­khonâs face and in that of Prince VasÃ­liâs valet,
 13089	who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot
 13090	water.
 13091	
 13092	The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of
 13093	his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking
 13094	expression of her fatherâs. His face wore that expression when his
 13095	dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in
 13096	arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her,
 13097	repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.
 13098	
 13099	He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.
 13100	
 13101	âI have had a proposition made me concerning you,â he said with an
 13102	unnatural smile. âI expect you have guessed that Prince VasÃ­li has
 13103	not come and brought his pupil with himâ (for some reason Prince
 13104	BolkÃ³nski referred to Anatole as a âpupilâ) âfor the sake of my
 13105	beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account
 13106	and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.â
 13107	
 13108	âHow am I to understand you, mon pÃ¨re?â said the princess, growing
 13109	pale and then blushing.
 13110	
 13111	âHow understand me!â cried her father angrily. âPrince VasÃ­li
 13112	finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you
 13113	on his pupilâs behalf. Thatâs how itâs to be understood! âHow
 13114	understand itâ!... And I ask you!â
 13115	
 13116	âI do not know what you think, Father,â whispered the princess.
 13117	
 13118	âI? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. Iâm not going to
 13119	get married. What about you? Thatâs what I want to know.â
 13120	
 13121	The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval,
 13122	but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
 13123	decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze
 13124	under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to
 13125	submit from habit, and she said: âI wish only to do your will, but if
 13126	I had to express my own desire...â She had no time to finish. The old
 13127	prince interrupted her.
 13128	
 13129	âThatâs admirable!â he shouted. âHe will take you with your
 13130	dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. Sheâll be the
 13131	wife, while you...â
 13132	
 13133	The prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his
 13134	daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.
 13135	
 13136	âNow then, now then, Iâm only joking!â he said. âRemember this,
 13137	Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
 13138	choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your lifeâs happiness
 13139	depends on your decision. Never mind me!â
 13140	
 13141	âBut I do not know, Father!â
 13142	
 13143	âThereâs no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you
 13144	or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it
 13145	over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no.
 13146	I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better
 13147	think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!â he still shouted
 13148	when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the
 13149	study.
 13150	
 13151	Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said
 13152	about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but
 13153	still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was
 13154	going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing
 13155	anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle
 13156	Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw
 13157	Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With
 13158	a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess
 13159	Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle
 13160	Bourienne who had not yet seen her.
 13161	
 13162	âWhoâs that? Why? Wait a moment!â Anatoleâs face seemed to say.
 13163	Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At
 13164	last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to
 13165	Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
 13166	this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
 13167	that led to his own apartments.
 13168	
 13169	An hour later, TÃ­khon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince;
 13170	he added that Prince VasÃ­li was also there. When TÃ­khon came to her
 13171	Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping
 13172	Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The
 13173	princessâ beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were
 13174	looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienneâs
 13175	pretty face.
 13176	
 13177	âNo, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!â said
 13178	Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 13179	
 13180	âWhy? I love you more than ever,â said Princess Mary, âand I will
 13181	try to do all I can for your happiness.â
 13182	
 13183	âBut you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so
 13184	carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...â
 13185	
 13186	âI quite understand,â answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile.
 13187	âCalm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,â she said, and went
 13188	out.
 13189	
 13190	Prince VasÃ­li, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox
 13191	in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face,
 13192	as if stirred to his heartâs core and himself regretting and laughing
 13193	at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a
 13194	pinch of snuff.
 13195	
 13196	âAh, my dear, my dear!â he began, rising and taking her by both
 13197	hands. Then, sighing, he added: âMy sonâs fate is in your hands.
 13198	Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a
 13199	daughter!â
 13200	
 13201	He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.
 13202	
 13203	âFr... fr...â snorted Prince BolkÃ³nski. âThe prince is making a
 13204	proposition to you in his pupilâsâI mean, his sonâsâname. Do you
 13205	wish or not to be Prince Anatole KurÃ¡ginâs wife? Reply: yes or no,â
 13206	he shouted, âand then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion
 13207	also. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,â added Prince BolkÃ³nski,
 13208	turning to Prince VasÃ­li and answering his imploring look. âYes, or
 13209	no?â
 13210	
 13211	âMy desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my
 13212	life from yours. I donât wish to marry,â she answered positively,
 13213	glancing at Prince VasÃ­li and at her father with her beautiful eyes.
 13214	
 13215	âHumbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!â cried Prince BolkÃ³nski,
 13216	frowning and taking his daughterâs hand; he did not kiss her, but only
 13217	bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so
 13218	that she winced and uttered a cry.
 13219	
 13220	Prince VasÃ­li rose.
 13221	
 13222	âMy dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never
 13223	forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching
 13224	this heart, so kind and generous? Say âperhapsâ... The future is so
 13225	long. Say âperhaps.ââ
 13226	
 13227	âPrince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for
 13228	the honor, but I shall never be your sonâs wife.â
 13229	
 13230	âWell, so thatâs finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have
 13231	seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!â said
 13232	the old prince. âVery, very glad to have seen you,â repeated he,
 13233	embracing Prince VasÃ­li.
 13234	
 13235	âMy vocation is a different one,â thought Princess Mary. âMy
 13236	vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness
 13237	of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange
 13238	poor AmÃ©lieâs happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so
 13239	passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between
 13240	them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my
 13241	father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so
 13242	unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately
 13243	she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might
 13244	have done the same!...â thought Princess Mary.
 13245	
 13246	
 13247	
 13248	
 13249	
 13250	CHAPTER VI
 13251	
 13252	It was long since the RostÃ³vs had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter
 13253	was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his sonâs
 13254	handwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and
 13255	haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the
 13256	letter.
 13257	
 13258	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house,
 13259	on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and
 13260	found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same
 13261	time.
 13262	
 13263	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still
 13264	living with the RostÃ³vs.
 13265	
 13266	âMy dear friend?â said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared
 13267	to sympathize in any way.
 13268	
 13269	The count sobbed yet more.
 13270	
 13271	âNikÃ³lenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling
 13272	boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How
 13273	tell the little countess!â
 13274	
 13275	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped
 13276	the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her
 13277	own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till
 13278	teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with Godâs
 13279	help, would inform her.
 13280	
 13281	At dinner Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna talked the whole time about the war news
 13282	and about NikÃ³lenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received
 13283	from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might
 13284	very likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these
 13285	hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at
 13286	the count and at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, the latter very adroitly turned
 13287	the conversation to insignificant matters. NatÃ¡sha, who, of the whole
 13288	family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of
 13289	intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning
 13290	of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her
 13291	father and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, that it had something to do with her
 13292	brother, and that Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as
 13293	she was, NatÃ¡sha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything
 13294	relating to NikÃ³lenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner,
 13295	but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her
 13296	chair regardless of her governessâ remarks. After dinner, she rushed
 13297	headlong after Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on
 13298	her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.
 13299	
 13300	âAuntie, darling, do tell me what it is!â
 13301	
 13302	âNothing, my dear.â
 13303	
 13304	âNo, dearest, sweet one, honey, I wonât give upâI know you know
 13305	something.â
 13306	
 13307	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna shook her head.
 13308	
 13309	âYou are a little slyboots,â she said.
 13310	
 13311	âA letter from NikÃ³lenka! Iâm sure of it!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha,
 13312	reading confirmation in Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs face.
 13313	
 13314	âBut for Godâs sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your
 13315	mamma.â
 13316	
 13317	âI will, I will, only tell me! You wonât? Then I will go and tell at
 13318	once.â
 13319	
 13320	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter,
 13321	on condition that she should tell no one.
 13322	
 13323	âNo, on my true word of honor,â said NatÃ¡sha, crossing herself,
 13324	âI wonât tell anyone!â and she ran off at once to SÃ³nya.
 13325	
 13326	âNikÃ³lenka... wounded... a letter,â she announced in gleeful
 13327	triumph.
 13328	
 13329	âNicholas!â was all SÃ³nya said, instantly turning white.
 13330	
 13331	NatÃ¡sha, seeing the impression the news of her brotherâs wound
 13332	produced on SÃ³nya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the
 13333	news.
 13334	
 13335	She rushed to SÃ³nya, hugged her, and began to cry.
 13336	
 13337	âA little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he
 13338	wrote himself,â said she through her tears.
 13339	
 13340	âThere now! Itâs true that all you women are crybabies,â remarked
 13341	PÃ©tya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. âNow Iâm very
 13342	glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so.
 13343	You are all blubberers and understand nothing.â
 13344	
 13345	NatÃ¡sha smiled through her tears.
 13346	
 13347	âYou havenât read the letter?â asked SÃ³nya.
 13348	
 13349	âNo, but she said that it was all over and that heâs now an
 13350	officer.â
 13351	
 13352	âThank God!â said SÃ³nya, crossing herself. âBut perhaps she
 13353	deceived you. Let us go to Mamma.â
 13354	
 13355	PÃ©tya paced the room in silence for a time.
 13356	
 13357	âIf Iâd been in NikÃ³lenkaâs place I would have killed even more
 13358	of those Frenchmen,â he said. âWhat nasty brutes they are! Iâd
 13359	have killed so many that thereâd have been a heap of them.â
 13360	
 13361	âHold your tongue, PÃ©tya, what a goose you are!â
 13362	
 13363	âIâm not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,â said
 13364	PÃ©tya.
 13365	
 13366	âDo you remember him?â NatÃ¡sha suddenly asked, after a momentâs
 13367	silence.
 13368	
 13369	SÃ³nya smiled.
 13370	
 13371	âDo I remember Nicholas?â
 13372	
 13373	âNo, SÃ³nya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly,
 13374	remember everything?â said NatÃ¡sha, with an expressive gesture,
 13375	evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning. âI
 13376	remember NikÃ³lenka too, I remember him well,â she said. âBut I
 13377	donât remember BorÃ­s. I donât remember him a bit.â
 13378	
 13379	âWhat! You donât remember BorÃ­s?â asked SÃ³nya in surprise.
 13380	
 13381	âItâs not that I donât rememberâI know what he is like, but not
 13382	as I remember NikÃ³lenka. HimâI just shut my eyes and remember,
 13383	but BorÃ­s... No!â (She shut her eyes.) âNo! thereâs nothing at
 13384	all.â
 13385	
 13386	âOh, NatÃ¡sha!â said SÃ³nya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at
 13387	her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant
 13388	to say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking
 13389	was out of the question, âI am in love with your brother once for all
 13390	and, whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him
 13391	as long as I live.â
 13392	
 13393	NatÃ¡sha looked at SÃ³nya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said
 13394	nothing. She felt that SÃ³nya was speaking the truth, that there was
 13395	such love as SÃ³nya was speaking of. But NatÃ¡sha had not yet felt
 13396	anything like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.
 13397	
 13398	âShall you write to him?â she asked.
 13399	
 13400	SÃ³nya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nicholas, and
 13401	whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an
 13402	officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself
 13403	and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on
 13404	himself?
 13405	
 13406	âI donât know. I think if he writes, I will write too,â she said,
 13407	blushing.
 13408	
 13409	âAnd you wonât feel ashamed to write to him?â
 13410	
 13411	SÃ³nya smiled.
 13412	
 13413	âNo.â
 13414	
 13415	âAnd I should be ashamed to write to BorÃ­s. Iâm not going to.â
 13416	
 13417	âWhy should you be ashamed?â
 13418	
 13419	âWell, I donât know. Itâs awkward and would make me ashamed.â
 13420	
 13421	âAnd I know why sheâd be ashamed,â said PÃ©tya, offended by
 13422	NatÃ¡shaâs previous remark. âItâs because she was in love with
 13423	that fat one in spectaclesâ (that was how PÃ©tya described his
 13424	namesake, the new Count BezÃºkhov) âand now sheâs in love with that
 13425	singerâ (he meant NatÃ¡shaâs Italian singing master), âthatâs
 13426	why sheâs ashamed!â
 13427	
 13428	âPÃ©tya, youâre stupid!â said NatÃ¡sha.
 13429	
 13430	âNot more stupid than you, madam,â said the nine-year-old PÃ©tya,
 13431	with the air of an old brigadier.
 13432	
 13433	The countess had been prepared by Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs hints at dinner.
 13434	On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a
 13435	miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears
 13436	kept coming into her eyes. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with the letter, came on
 13437	tiptoe to the countessâ door and paused.
 13438	
 13439	âDonât come in,â she said to the old count who was following her.
 13440	âCome later.â And she went in, closing the door behind her.
 13441	
 13442	The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.
 13443	
 13444	At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna
 13445	MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence,
 13446	then both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps.
 13447	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression
 13448	of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the
 13449	public to appreciate his skill.
 13450	
 13451	âIt is done!â she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the
 13452	countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and
 13453	in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.
 13454	
 13455	When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his
 13456	bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait,
 13457	and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away
 13458	the bald head. VÃ©ra, NatÃ¡sha, SÃ³nya, and PÃ©tya now entered the room,
 13459	and the reading of the letter began. After a brief description of
 13460	the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his
 13461	promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his fatherâs and motherâs
 13462	hands asking for their blessing, and that he kissed VÃ©ra, NatÃ¡sha, and
 13463	PÃ©tya. Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame
 13464	Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him âdear
 13465	SÃ³nya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever.â When she
 13466	heard this SÃ³nya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable
 13467	to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall,
 13468	whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon,
 13469	and, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor. The countess was
 13470	crying.
 13471	
 13472	âWhy are you crying, Mamma?â asked VÃ©ra. âFrom all he says one
 13473	should be glad and not cry.â
 13474	
 13475	This was quite true, but the count, the countess, and NatÃ¡sha looked
 13476	at her reproachfully. âAnd who is it she takes after?â thought the
 13477	countess.
 13478	
 13479	Nicholasâ letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were
 13480	considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she
 13481	did not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and
 13482	DmÃ­tri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter
 13483	each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh
 13484	proofs of NikÃ³lenkaâs virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how
 13485	joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
 13486	tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom
 13487	she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who
 13488	had first learned to say âpearâ and then âgranny,â that this son
 13489	should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly
 13490	warrior doing some kind of manâs work of his own, without help or
 13491	guidance. The universal experience of ages, showing that children do
 13492	grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the
 13493	countess. Her sonâs growth toward manhood, at each of its stages,
 13494	had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the
 13495	millions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty
 13496	years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived
 13497	somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to
 13498	speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be
 13499	this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this
 13500	letter, he now was.
 13501	
 13502	âWhat a style! How charmingly he describes!â said she, reading the
 13503	descriptive part of the letter. âAnd what a soul! Not a word about
 13504	himself.... Not a word! About some DenÃ­sov or other, though he himself,
 13505	I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about his
 13506	sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered
 13507	everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so
 13508	highâI always said....â
 13509	
 13510	For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of
 13511	letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out,
 13512	while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the
 13513	count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment
 13514	of the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,
 13515	practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army
 13516	authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself
 13517	and her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand
 13518	Duke Constantine PÃ¡vlovich, who commanded the Guards. The RostÃ³vs
 13519	supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address,
 13520	and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards
 13521	there was no reason why it should not reach the PÃ¡vlograd regiment,
 13522	which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was
 13523	decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Dukeâs courier to
 13524	BorÃ­s and BorÃ­s was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were from
 13525	the old count, the countess, PÃ©tya, VÃ©ra, NatÃ¡sha, and SÃ³nya, and
 13526	finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other
 13527	things the old count sent to his son.
 13528	
 13529	
 13530	
 13531	
 13532	
 13533	CHAPTER VII
 13534	
 13535	On the twelfth of November, KutÃºzovâs active army, in camp before
 13536	OlmÃ¼tz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperorsâthe
 13537	Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent
 13538	the night ten miles from OlmÃ¼tz and next morning were to come straight
 13539	to the review, reaching the field at OlmÃ¼tz by ten oâclock.
 13540	
 13541	That day Nicholas RostÃ³v received a letter from BorÃ­s, telling him
 13542	that the IsmÃ¡ylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from
 13543	OlmÃ¼tz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for
 13544	him. RostÃ³v was particularly in need of money now that the troops,
 13545	after their active service, were stationed near OlmÃ¼tz and the camp
 13546	swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering
 13547	all sorts of tempting wares. The PÃ¡vlograds held feast after feast,
 13548	celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made
 13549	expeditions to OlmÃ¼tz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian,
 13550	who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.
 13551	RostÃ³v, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought
 13552	DenÃ­sovâs horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and
 13553	the sutlers. On receiving BorÃ­sâ letter he rode with a fellow officer
 13554	to OlmÃ¼tz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone
 13555	to the Guardsâ camp to find his old playmate. RostÃ³v had not yet had
 13556	time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with
 13557	a soldierâs cross, equally shabby cadetâs riding breeches lined with
 13558	worn leather, and an officerâs saber with a sword knot. The Don horse
 13559	he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign,
 13560	and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his
 13561	head. As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress BorÃ­s
 13562	and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearanceâthat of a
 13563	fighting hussar who had been under fire.
 13564	
 13565	The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading
 13566	their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their
 13567	knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided
 13568	excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments
 13569	had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand
 13570	Dukeâs orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on
 13571	which the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their
 13572	proper posts. BorÃ­s had been quartered, and had marched all the
 13573	way, with Berg who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had
 13574	obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of
 13575	his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money
 13576	matters very satisfactorily. BorÃ­s, during the campaign, had made the
 13577	acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by
 13578	a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become
 13579	acquainted with Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski, through whom he hoped to
 13580	obtain a post on the commander in chiefâs staff. Berg and BorÃ­s,
 13581	having rested after yesterdayâs march, were sitting, clean and neatly
 13582	dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them,
 13583	playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. BorÃ­s, in
 13584	the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of
 13585	chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Bergâs move,
 13586	and watched his opponentâs face, evidently thinking about the game as
 13587	he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on.
 13588	
 13589	âWell, how are you going to get out of that?â he remarked.
 13590	
 13591	âWeâll try to,â replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing
 13592	his hand.
 13593	
 13594	At that moment the door opened.
 13595	
 13596	âHere he is at last!â shouted RostÃ³v. âAnd Berg too! Oh, you
 13597	petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!â he exclaimed, imitating his Russian
 13598	nurseâs French, at which he and BorÃ­s used to laugh long ago.
 13599	
 13600	âDear me, how you have changed!â
 13601	
 13602	BorÃ­s rose to meet RostÃ³v, but in doing so did not omit to steady and
 13603	replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his
 13604	friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth,
 13605	that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner
 13606	different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas
 13607	wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch
 13608	him, push him, do anything but kiss himâa thing everybody did. But
 13609	notwithstanding this, BorÃ­s embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and
 13610	kissed him three times.
 13611	
 13612	They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young
 13613	men take their first steps on lifeâs road, each saw immense changes in
 13614	the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken
 13615	those first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both
 13616	were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.
 13617	
 13618	âOh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if youâd been to a fete,
 13619	not like us sinners of the line,â cried RostÃ³v, with martial swagger
 13620	and with baritone notes in his voice, new to BorÃ­s, pointing to his own
 13621	mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing RostÃ³vâs loud
 13622	voice, popped her head in at the door.
 13623	
 13624	âEh, is she pretty?â he asked with a wink.
 13625	
 13626	âWhy do you shout so? Youâll frighten them!â said BorÃ­s. âI did
 13627	not expect you today,â he added. âI only sent you the note yesterday
 13628	by BolkÃ³nskiâan adjutant of KutÃºzovâs, whoâs a friend of mine.
 13629	I did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you?
 13630	Been under fire already?â asked BorÃ­s.
 13631	
 13632	Without answering, RostÃ³v shook the soldierâs Cross of St. George
 13633	fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,
 13634	glanced at Berg with a smile.
 13635	
 13636	âAs you see,â he said.
 13637	
 13638	âIndeed? Yes, yes!â said BorÃ­s, with a smile. âAnd we too have
 13639	had a splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness
 13640	rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and
 13641	every advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and
 13642	balls! I canât tell you. And the TsarÃ©vich was very gracious to all
 13643	our officers.â
 13644	
 13645	And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his
 13646	hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures
 13647	and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family.
 13648	
 13649	âOh, you Guards!â said RostÃ³v. âI say, send for some wine.â
 13650	
 13651	BorÃ­s made a grimace.
 13652	
 13653	âIf you really want it,â said he.
 13654	
 13655	He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent
 13656	for wine.
 13657	
 13658	âYes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,â he added.
 13659	
 13660	RostÃ³v took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both
 13661	arms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he
 13662	glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the
 13663	letter.
 13664	
 13665	âWell, theyâve sent you a tidy sum,â said Berg, eying the heavy
 13666	purse that sank into the sofa. âAs for us, Count, we get along on our
 13667	pay. I can tell you for myself...â
 13668	
 13669	âI say, Berg, my dear fellow,â said RostÃ³v, âwhen you get a
 13670	letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk
 13671	everything over with, and I happen to be there, Iâll go at once, to
 13672	be out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!â he
 13673	exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking
 13674	amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his
 13675	words, he added, âDonât be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak
 13676	from my heart as to an old acquaintance.â
 13677	
 13678	âOh, donât mention it, Count! I quite understand,â said Berg,
 13679	getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.
 13680	
 13681	âGo across to our hosts: they invited you,â added BorÃ­s.
 13682	
 13683	Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust,
 13684	stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
 13685	upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having
 13686	assured himself from the way RostÃ³v looked at it that his coat had been
 13687	noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.
 13688	
 13689	âOh dear, what a beast I am!â muttered RostÃ³v, as he read the
 13690	letter.
 13691	
 13692	âWhy?â
 13693	
 13694	âOh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them
 13695	such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!â he repeated, flushing suddenly.
 13696	âWell, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right letâs have
 13697	some!â
 13698	
 13699	In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation
 13700	to BagratiÃ³n which the old countess at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs advice had
 13701	obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take
 13702	it to its destination and make use of it.
 13703	
 13704	âWhat nonsense! Much I need it!â said RostÃ³v, throwing the letter
 13705	under the table.
 13706	
 13707	âWhy have you thrown that away?â asked BorÃ­s.
 13708	
 13709	âIt is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it
 13710	for!â
 13711	
 13712	âWhy âWhat the devilâ?â said BorÃ­s, picking it up and reading
 13713	the address. âThis letter would be of great use to you.â
 13714	
 13715	âI want nothing, and I wonât be anyoneâs adjutant.â
 13716	
 13717	âWhy not?â inquired BorÃ­s.
 13718	
 13719	âItâs a lackeyâs job!â
 13720	
 13721	âYou are still the same dreamer, I see,â remarked BorÃ­s, shaking
 13722	his head.
 13723	
 13724	âAnd youâre still the same diplomatist! But thatâs not the
 13725	point... Come, how are you?â asked RostÃ³v.
 13726	
 13727	âWell, as you see. So far everythingâs all right, but I confess I
 13728	should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.â
 13729	
 13730	âWhy?â
 13731	
 13732	âBecause when once a man starts on military service, he should try to
 13733	make as successful a career of it as possible.â
 13734	
 13735	âOh, thatâs it!â said RostÃ³v, evidently thinking of something
 13736	else.
 13737	
 13738	He looked intently and inquiringly into his friendâs eyes, evidently
 13739	trying in vain to find the answer to some question.
 13740	
 13741	Old Gabriel brought in the wine.
 13742	
 13743	âShouldnât we now send for Berg?â asked BorÃ­s. âHe would drink
 13744	with you. I canât.â
 13745	
 13746	âWell, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?â
 13747	asked RostÃ³v, with a contemptuous smile.
 13748	
 13749	âHe is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,â answered
 13750	BorÃ­s.
 13751	
 13752	Again RostÃ³v looked intently into BorÃ­sâ eyes and sighed. Berg
 13753	returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three
 13754	officers became animated. The Guardsmen told RostÃ³v of their march and
 13755	how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke
 13756	of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told
 13757	stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent
 13758	when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the
 13759	stories of the Grand Dukeâs quick temper he related with gusto how in
 13760	Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter
 13761	made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of
 13762	a movement. With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke
 13763	had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: âArnauts!â
 13764	(âArnautsâ was the TsarÃ©vichâs favorite expression when he was in
 13765	a rage) and called for the company commander.
 13766	
 13767	âWould you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew
 13768	I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army
 13769	Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lordâs
 13770	Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and
 13771	so my conscience was at ease. I came forward....â (Berg stood up and
 13772	showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really
 13773	it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and
 13774	self-complacency than his did.) âWell, he stormed at me, as the saying
 13775	is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but
 13776	rather of death, as the saying is. âAlbanians!â and âdevils!â
 13777	and âTo Siberia!ââ said Berg with a sagacious smile. âI knew I
 13778	was in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... âHey,
 13779	are you dumb?â he shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you
 13780	think, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of
 13781	the Day. Thatâs what keeping oneâs head means. Thatâs the way,
 13782	Count,â said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.
 13783	
 13784	âYes, that was fine,â said RostÃ³v, smiling.
 13785	
 13786	But BorÃ­s noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and
 13787	skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where
 13788	he got his wound. This pleased RostÃ³v and he began talking about it,
 13789	and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his
 13790	SchÃ¶n Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle
 13791	generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been,
 13792	as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not
 13793	at all as it really was. RostÃ³v was a truthful young man and would on
 13794	no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to
 13795	tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily,
 13796	and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his
 13797	hearersâwho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had
 13798	formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear
 13799	just such a storyâthey would either not have believed him or, still
 13800	worse, would have thought that RostÃ³v was himself to blame since what
 13801	generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened
 13802	to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and
 13803	that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as
 13804	he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as
 13805	it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of
 13806	will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth,
 13807	and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story
 13808	of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like
 13809	a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his
 13810	saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he
 13811	told them all that.
 13812	
 13813	In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: âYou cannot imagine
 13814	what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,â Prince
 13815	Andrew, whom BorÃ­s was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who
 13816	liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance
 13817	and being well disposed toward BorÃ­s, who had managed to please him the
 13818	day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent
 13819	with papers from KutÃºzov to the TsarÃ©vich, he looked in on BorÃ­s,
 13820	hoping to find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line
 13821	recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure
 13822	that sort of man), he gave BorÃ­s a pleasant smile, frowned as with
 13823	half-closed eyes he looked at RostÃ³v, bowed slightly and wearily, and
 13824	sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped
 13825	in on bad company. RostÃ³v flushed up on noticing this, but he did not
 13826	care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing, however, at BorÃ­s, he saw
 13827	that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.
 13828	
 13829	In spite of Prince Andrewâs disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of
 13830	the contempt with which RostÃ³v, from his fighting army point of view,
 13831	regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer
 13832	was evidently one, RostÃ³v felt confused, blushed, and became silent.
 13833	BorÃ­s inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without
 13834	indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.
 13835	
 13836	âWe shall probably advance,â replied BolkÃ³nski, evidently reluctant
 13837	to say more in the presence of a stranger.
 13838	
 13839	Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was
 13840	rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be
 13841	doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could
 13842	give no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed
 13843	gaily.
 13844	
 13845	âAs to your business,â Prince Andrew continued, addressing BorÃ­s,
 13846	âwe will talk of it laterâ (and he looked round at RostÃ³v). âCome
 13847	to me after the review and we will do what is possible.â
 13848	
 13849	And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to RostÃ³v,
 13850	whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to
 13851	anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: âI think you were
 13852	talking of the SchÃ¶n Grabern affair? Were you there?â
 13853	
 13854	âI was there,â said RostÃ³v angrily, as if intending to insult the
 13855	aide-de-camp.
 13856	
 13857	BolkÃ³nski noticed the hussarâs state of mind, and it amused him. With
 13858	a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: âYes, there are many stories
 13859	now told about that affair!â
 13860	
 13861	âYes, stories!â repeated RostÃ³v loudly, looking with eyes suddenly
 13862	grown furious, now at BorÃ­s, now at BolkÃ³nski. âYes, many stories!
 13863	But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemyâs
 13864	fire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those
 13865	fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!â
 13866	
 13867	âOf whom you imagine me to be one?â said Prince Andrew, with a quiet
 13868	and particularly amiable smile.
 13869	
 13870	A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this manâs
 13871	self-possession mingled at that moment in RostÃ³vâs soul.
 13872	
 13873	âI am not talking about you,â he said, âI donât know you and,
 13874	frankly, I donât want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.â
 13875	
 13876	âAnd I will tell you this,â Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of
 13877	quiet authority, âyou wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with
 13878	you that it would be very easy to do so if you havenât sufficient
 13879	self-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen.
 13880	In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more
 13881	serious duel, and besides, DrubetskÃ³y, who says he is an old friend
 13882	of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to
 13883	displease you. However,â he added rising, âyou know my name and
 13884	where to find me, but donât forget that I do not regard either myself
 13885	or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my
 13886	advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review
 13887	I shall expect you, DrubetskÃ³y. Au revoir!â exclaimed Prince Andrew,
 13888	and with a bow to them both he went out.
 13889	
 13890	Only when Prince Andrew was gone did RostÃ³v think of what he ought to
 13891	have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He
 13892	ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of BorÃ­s, rode
 13893	home. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected
 13894	adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried
 13895	him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at
 13896	seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by
 13897	his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew
 13898	there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very
 13899	adjutant whom he so hated.
 13900	
 13901	
 13902	
 13903	
 13904	
 13905	CHAPTER VIII
 13906	
 13907	The day after RostÃ³v had been to see BorÃ­s, a review was held of the
 13908	Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia and
 13909	those who had been campaigning under KutÃºzov. The two Emperors,
 13910	the Russian with his heir the TsarÃ©vich, and the Austrian with the
 13911	Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.
 13912	
 13913	From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up
 13914	on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets
 13915	moved and halted at the officersâ command, turned with banners flying,
 13916	formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of
 13917	infantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of
 13918	hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided
 13919	uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan,
 13920	or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the
 13921	polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with
 13922	the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the
 13923	infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the
 13924	generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn
 13925	in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and
 13926	wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded
 13927	officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and
 13928	his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed
 13929	till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay
 13930	smoothâfelt that no small matter was happening, but an important and
 13931	solemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own
 13932	insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and
 13933	yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that
 13934	enormous whole.
 13935	
 13936	From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten
 13937	oâclock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn
 13938	up on the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the
 13939	cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the
 13940	infantry.
 13941	
 13942	A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The
 13943	three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: KutÃºzovâs
 13944	fighting army (with the PÃ¡vlograds on the right flank of the front);
 13945	those recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the
 13946	line; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines,
 13947	under one command, and in a like order.
 13948	
 13949	Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: âTheyâre coming!
 13950	Theyâre coming!â Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final
 13951	preparation swept over all the troops.
 13952	
 13953	From the direction of OlmÃ¼tz in front of them, a group was seen
 13954	approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust
 13955	of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the
 13956	lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It
 13957	looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its
 13958	joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting:
 13959	âEyes front!â Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was
 13960	repeated by others from various sides and all became silent.
 13961	
 13962	In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This
 13963	was the Emperorsâ suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the
 13964	trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It
 13965	seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army
 13966	itself, rejoicing at the Emperorsâ approach, had naturally burst into
 13967	music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor
 13968	Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the
 13969	first regiment roared âHurrah!â so deafeningly, continuously, and
 13970	joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the
 13971	immensity of the power they constituted.
 13972	
 13973	RostÃ³v, standing in the front lines of KutÃºzovâs army which the Tsar
 13974	approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in
 13975	that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of
 13976	might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
 13977	triumph.
 13978	
 13979	He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he
 13980	himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water,
 13981	commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could
 13982	not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.
 13983	
 13984	âHurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!â thundered from all sides, one regiment
 13985	after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then
 13986	âHurrah!â... Then the general march, and again âHurrah! Hurrah!â
 13987	growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.
 13988	
 13989	Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility
 13990	seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive,
 13991	its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had
 13992	already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices,
 13993	amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to
 13994	stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but
 13995	symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two menâthe
 13996	Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that
 13997	whole mass of men was concentrated.
 13998	
 13999	The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse
 14000	Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his
 14001	pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyoneâs
 14002	attention.
 14003	
 14004	RostÃ³v was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had
 14005	recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty
 14006	paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his
 14007	handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness
 14008	and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every
 14009	movement of the Tsarâs seemed to him enchanting.
 14010	
 14011	Stopping in front of the PÃ¡vlograds, the Tsar said something in French
 14012	to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.
 14013	
 14014	Seeing that smile, RostÃ³v involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still
 14015	stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in
 14016	some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar
 14017	called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.
 14018	
 14019	âOh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?â
 14020	thought RostÃ³v. âI should die of happiness!â
 14021	
 14022	The Tsar addressed the officers also: âI thank you all, gentlemen, I
 14023	thank you with my whole heart.â To RostÃ³v every word sounded like a
 14024	voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!
 14025	
 14026	âYou have earned the St. Georgeâs standards and will be worthy of
 14027	them.â
 14028	
 14029	âOh, to die, to die for him,â thought RostÃ³v.
 14030	
 14031	The Tsar said something more which RostÃ³v did not hear, and the
 14032	soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted âHurrah!â
 14033	
 14034	RostÃ³v too, bending over his saddle, shouted âHurrah!â with all his
 14035	might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if
 14036	only to express his rapture fully.
 14037	
 14038	The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.
 14039	
 14040	âHow can the Emperor be undecided?â thought RostÃ³v, but then even
 14041	this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything
 14042	else the Tsar did.
 14043	
 14044	That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsarâs foot, in the narrow
 14045	pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay
 14046	mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he
 14047	moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp.
 14048	Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at
 14049	last only his white plumes were visible to RostÃ³v from amid the suites
 14050	that surrounded the Emperors.
 14051	
 14052	Among the gentlemen of the suite, RostÃ³v noticed BolkÃ³nski, sitting
 14053	his horse indolently and carelessly. RostÃ³v recalled their quarrel of
 14054	yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought
 14055	not to challenge BolkÃ³nski. âOf course not!â he now thought. âIs
 14056	it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such
 14057	love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels
 14058	and affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now.â
 14059	
 14060	When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began
 14061	a ceremonial march past him, and RostÃ³v on Bedouin, recently purchased
 14062	from DenÃ­sov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadronâthat is,
 14063	alone and in full view of the Emperor.
 14064	
 14065	Before he reached him, RostÃ³v, who was a splendid horseman, spurred
 14066	Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
 14067	animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his
 14068	tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperorâs eye
 14069	upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful
 14070	action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.
 14071	
 14072	RostÃ³v himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling
 14073	himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but
 14074	blissful face âlike a vewy devil,â as DenÃ­sov expressed it.
 14075	
 14076	âFine fellows, the PÃ¡vlograds!â remarked the Emperor.
 14077	
 14078	âMy God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire
 14079	this instant!â thought RostÃ³v.
 14080	
 14081	When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also
 14082	KutÃºzovâs, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards,
 14083	about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about
 14084	Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the
 14085	Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.
 14086	
 14087	But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His
 14088	every word and movement was described with ecstasy.
 14089	
 14090	They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the
 14091	enemy under the Emperorâs command. Commanded by the Emperor himself
 14092	they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought
 14093	RostÃ³v and most of the officers after the review.
 14094	
 14095	All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles
 14096	would have made them.
 14097	
 14098	
 14099	
 14100	
 14101	
 14102	CHAPTER IX
 14103	
 14104	The day after the review, BorÃ­s, in his best uniform and with his
 14105	comrade Bergâs best wishes for success, rode to OlmÃ¼tz to see
 14106	BolkÃ³nski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself
 14107	the best post he couldâpreferably that of adjutant to some important
 14108	personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive.
 14109	âIt is all very well for RostÃ³v, whose father sends him ten thousand
 14110	rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not
 14111	be anyoneâs lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to
 14112	make a career and must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of
 14113	them!â he reflected.
 14114	
 14115	He did not find Prince Andrew in OlmÃ¼tz that day, but the appearance of
 14116	the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed
 14117	and the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and
 14118	courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.
 14119	
 14120	He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsmanâs uniform, all these
 14121	exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages
 14122	with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military
 14123	men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the
 14124	Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be
 14125	aware of his existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief,
 14126	KutÃºzov, where he inquired for BolkÃ³nski, all the adjutants and even
 14127	the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a
 14128	great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody
 14129	was heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather because of
 14130	it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to OlmÃ¼tz and,
 14131	entering the house occupied by KutÃºzov, asked for BolkÃ³nski. Prince
 14132	Andrew was in and BorÃ­s was shown into a large hall probably formerly
 14133	used for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of
 14134	various kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest
 14135	the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing.
 14136	Another, the red, stout NesvÃ­tski, lay on a bed with his arms under his
 14137	head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was
 14138	playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on
 14139	the clavichord, sang the tune. BolkÃ³nski was not there. None of these
 14140	gentlemen changed his position on seeing BorÃ­s. The one who was writing
 14141	and whom BorÃ­s addressed turned round crossly and told him BolkÃ³nski
 14142	was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the
 14143	reception room if he wished to see him. BorÃ­s thanked him and went to
 14144	the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.
 14145	
 14146	When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with
 14147	that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, âIf
 14148	it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a momentâ), was
 14149	listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very
 14150	erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldierâs obsequious expression on his
 14151	purple face, reporting something.
 14152	
 14153	âVery well, then, be so good as to wait,â said Prince Andrew to the
 14154	general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected
 14155	when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing BorÃ­s, Prince
 14156	Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring
 14157	him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful
 14158	smile.
 14159	
 14160	At that moment BorÃ­s clearly realized what he had before surmised, that
 14161	in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the
 14162	military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was
 14163	another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced,
 14164	purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for
 14165	his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant DrubetskÃ³y. More than
 14166	ever was BorÃ­s resolved to serve in future not according to the written
 14167	code, but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having
 14168	been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general
 14169	who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the
 14170	Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.
 14171	
 14172	âI am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about
 14173	with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.
 14174	When Germans start being accurate, thereâs no end to it!â
 14175	
 14176	BorÃ­s smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to
 14177	as something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard
 14178	Weyrotherâs name, or even the term âdispositions.â
 14179	
 14180	âWell, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have
 14181	been thinking about you.â
 14182	
 14183	âYes, I was thinkingââfor some reason BorÃ­s could not help
 14184	blushingââof asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from
 14185	Prince KurÃ¡gin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards
 14186	wonât be in action,â he added as if in apology.
 14187	
 14188	âAll right, all right. Weâll talk it over,â replied Prince Andrew.
 14189	âOnly let me report this gentlemanâs business, and I shall be at
 14190	your disposal.â
 14191	
 14192	While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that
 14193	gentlemanâevidently not sharing BorÃ­sâ conception of the advantages
 14194	of the unwritten code of subordinationâlooked so fixedly at the
 14195	presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to
 14196	say to the adjutant that BorÃ­s felt uncomfortable. He turned away and
 14197	waited impatiently for Prince Andrewâs return from the commander in
 14198	chiefâs room.
 14199	
 14200	âYou see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,â
 14201	said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the
 14202	clavichord was. âItâs no use your going to the commander in chief.
 14203	He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinnerâ (âThat
 14204	would not be bad as regards the unwritten code,â thought BorÃ­s),
 14205	âbut nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of
 14206	us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what weâll do: I have
 14207	a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince
 14208	DolgorÃºkov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now
 14209	KutÃºzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is
 14210	now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to DolgorÃºkov; I have to
 14211	go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall
 14212	see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you
 14213	somewhere nearer the sun.â
 14214	
 14215	Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young
 14216	man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help
 14217	of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for
 14218	himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and
 14219	which attracted him. He very readily took up BorÃ­sâ cause and went
 14220	with him to DolgorÃºkov.
 14221	
 14222	It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at OlmÃ¼tz
 14223	occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.
 14224	
 14225	That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of
 14226	the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary
 14227	to the views of the old generals KutÃºzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it
 14228	had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte.
 14229	The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied
 14230	by BorÃ­s arrived at the palace to find DolgorÃºkov. Everyone at
 14231	headquarters was still under the spell of the dayâs council, at which
 14232	the party of the young had triumphed. The voices of those who counseled
 14233	delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been
 14234	so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive
 14235	evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed
 14236	at the councilâthe coming battle and the victory that would certainly
 14237	result from itâno longer seemed to be in the future but in the past.
 14238	All the advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly
 14239	superior to Napoleonâs, were concentrated in one place, the troops
 14240	inspired by the Emperorsâ presence were eager for action. The
 14241	strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in
 14242	all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had
 14243	ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the
 14244	very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent
 14245	locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte,
 14246	evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.
 14247	
 14248	DolgorÃºkov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just
 14249	returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud
 14250	of the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his
 14251	protÃ©gÃ©, but Prince DolgorÃºkov politely and firmly pressing his hand
 14252	said nothing to BorÃ­s and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts
 14253	which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew
 14254	in French.
 14255	
 14256	âAh, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that
 14257	the one that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear
 14258	fellow,â he said abruptly and eagerly, âI must confess to having
 14259	been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What
 14260	exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what
 14261	foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest
 14262	detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones
 14263	could have been devised. This combination of Austrian precision with
 14264	Russian valorâwhat more could be wished for?â
 14265	
 14266	âSo the attack is definitely resolved on?â asked BolkÃ³nski.
 14267	
 14268	âAnd do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has
 14269	decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him
 14270	today for the Emperor.â DolgorÃºkov smiled significantly.
 14271	
 14272	âIs that so? And what did he say?â inquired BolkÃ³nski.
 14273	
 14274	âWhat can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time.
 14275	I tell you he is in our hands, thatâs certain! But what was most
 14276	amusing,â he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, âwas that
 14277	we could not think how to address the reply! If not as âConsulâ
 14278	and of course not as âEmperor,â it seemed to me it should be to
 14279	âGeneral Bonaparte.ââ
 14280	
 14281	âBut between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General
 14282	Bonaparte, there is a difference,â remarked BolkÃ³nski.
 14283	
 14284	âThatâs just it,â interrupted DolgorÃºkov quickly, laughing.
 14285	âYou know BilÃ­binâheâs a very clever fellow. He suggested
 14286	addressing him as âUsurper and Enemy of Mankind.ââ
 14287	
 14288	DolgorÃºkov laughed merrily.
 14289	
 14290	âOnly that?â said BolkÃ³nski.
 14291	
 14292	âAll the same, it was BilÃ­bin who found a suitable form for the
 14293	address. He is a wise and clever fellow.â
 14294	
 14295	âWhat was it?â
 14296	
 14297	âTo the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement
 14298	franÃ§ais,â said DolgorÃºkov, with grave satisfaction. âGood,
 14299	wasnât it?â
 14300	
 14301	âYes, but he will dislike it extremely,â said BolkÃ³nski.
 14302	
 14303	âOh yes, very much! My brother knows him, heâs dined with himâthe
 14304	present Emperorâmore than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a
 14305	more cunning or subtle diplomatistâyou know, a combination of French
 14306	adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and
 14307	Count MarkÃ³v? Count MarkÃ³v was the only man who knew how to handle
 14308	him. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!â
 14309	
 14310	And the talkative DolgorÃºkov, turning now to BorÃ­s, now to Prince
 14311	Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test MarkÃ³v, our ambassador,
 14312	purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking
 14313	at MarkÃ³v, probably expecting MarkÃ³v to pick it up for him, and how
 14314	MarkÃ³v immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without
 14315	touching Bonaparteâs.
 14316	
 14317	âDelightful!â said BolkÃ³nski. âBut I have come to you, Prince,
 14318	as a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...â but
 14319	before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon
 14320	DolgorÃºkov to the Emperor.
 14321	
 14322	âOh, what a nuisance,â said DolgorÃºkov, getting up hurriedly and
 14323	pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and BorÃ­s. âYou know I should
 14324	be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young
 14325	man.â Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of
 14326	good-natured, sincere, and animated levity. âBut you see... another
 14327	time!â
 14328	
 14329	BorÃ­s was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers
 14330	as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here
 14331	he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous
 14332	movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny,
 14333	obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince DolgorÃºkov out
 14334	into the corridor and metâcoming out of the door of the Emperorâs
 14335	room by which DolgorÃºkov had enteredâa short man in civilian clothes
 14336	with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling
 14337	his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression.
 14338	This short man nodded to DolgorÃºkov as to an intimate friend and stared
 14339	at Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and
 14340	evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. Prince Andrew
 14341	did neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other
 14342	turned away and went down the side of the corridor.
 14343	
 14344	âWho was that?â asked BorÃ­s.
 14345	
 14346	âHe is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of
 14347	menâthe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam CzartorÃ½ski.... It
 14348	is such men as he who decide the fate of nations,â added BolkÃ³nski
 14349	with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.
 14350	
 14351	Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of
 14352	Austerlitz, BorÃ­s was unable to see either Prince Andrew or DolgorÃºkov
 14353	again and remained for a while with the IsmÃ¡ylov regiment.

 14359	CHAPTER X
 14360	
 14361	At dawn on the sixteenth of November, DenÃ­sovâs squadron, in
 14362	which Nicholas RostÃ³v served and which was in Prince BagratiÃ³nâs
 14363	detachment, moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing
 14364	into action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for
 14365	about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. RostÃ³v saw the
 14366	Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry
 14367	battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals
 14368	BagratiÃ³n and DolgorÃºkov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear
 14369	before action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner
 14370	struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself
 14371	as a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron
 14372	remained in reserve and Nicholas RostÃ³v spent that day in a dull and
 14373	wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and
 14374	shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not
 14375	many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French
 14376	cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a sÃ³tnya of Cossacks. Evidently the
 14377	affair was over and, though not big, had been a successful engagement.
 14378	The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the
 14379	occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French
 14380	squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and
 14381	the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of
 14382	victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken
 14383	part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers,
 14384	officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed RostÃ³v going or
 14385	coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that
 14386	precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all
 14387	the more depressed.
 14388	
 14389	âCome here, WostÃ³v. Letâs dwink to dwown our gwief!â shouted
 14390	DenÃ­sov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some
 14391	food.
 14392	
 14393	The officers gathered round DenÃ­sovâs canteen, eating and talking.
 14394	
 14395	âThere! They are bringing another!â cried one of the officers,
 14396	indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by
 14397	two Cossacks.
 14398	
 14399	One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had
 14400	taken from the prisoner.
 14401	
 14402	âSell us that horse!â DenÃ­sov called out to the Cossacks.
 14403	
 14404	âIf you like, your honor!â
 14405	
 14406	The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.
 14407	The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German
 14408	accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when
 14409	he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,
 14410	addressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been
 14411	taken, it was not his fault but the corporalâs who had sent him to
 14412	seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there.
 14413	And at every word he added: âBut donât hurt my little horse!â and
 14414	stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he
 14415	was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now,
 14416	imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly
 14417	discipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our
 14418	rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was
 14419	so alien to us.
 14420	
 14421	The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and RostÃ³v, being the
 14422	richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.
 14423	
 14424	âBut donât hurt my little horse!â said the Alsatian good-naturedly
 14425	to RostÃ³v when the animal was handed over to the hussar.
 14426	
 14427	RostÃ³v smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.
 14428	
 14429	âAlley! Alley!â said the Cossack, touching the prisonerâs arm to
 14430	make him go on.
 14431	
 14432	âThe Emperor! The Emperor!â was suddenly heard among the hussars.
 14433	
 14434	All began to run and bustle, and RostÃ³v saw coming up the road behind
 14435	him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone
 14436	was in his place, waiting.
 14437	
 14438	RostÃ³v did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.
 14439	Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood
 14440	amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of
 14441	himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to
 14442	the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the
 14443	day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of
 14444	meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he
 14445	was ecstatically conscious of his approach. He felt it not only from the
 14446	sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew
 14447	near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more
 14448	festive around him. Nearer and nearer to RostÃ³v came that sun shedding
 14449	beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself
 14450	enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm,
 14451	and majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with
 14452	RostÃ³vâs feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard
 14453	the Emperorâs voice.
 14454	
 14455	âThe PÃ¡vlograd hussars?â he inquired.
 14456	
 14457	âThe reserves, sire!â replied a voice, a very human one compared to
 14458	that which had said: âThe PÃ¡vlograd hussars?â
 14459	
 14460	The Emperor drew level with RostÃ³v and halted. Alexanderâs face was
 14461	even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It
 14462	shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested
 14463	the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face
 14464	of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the
 14465	Emperorâs eyes met RostÃ³vâs and rested on them for not more than
 14466	two seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in
 14467	RostÃ³vâs soul (it seemed to RostÃ³v that he understood everything),
 14468	at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into
 14469	RostÃ³vâs face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at
 14470	once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left
 14471	foot, and galloped on.
 14472	
 14473	The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
 14474	battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve
 14475	oâclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped
 14476	toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several
 14477	adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.
 14478	
 14479	This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was
 14480	represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the
 14481	Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over
 14482	the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were
 14483	retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had
 14484	passed, the PÃ¡vlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau
 14485	itself, a petty German town, RostÃ³v saw the Emperor again. In the
 14486	market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
 14487	Emperorâs arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there
 14488	had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite
 14489	of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a
 14490	different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending
 14491	to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
 14492	at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The
 14493	wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity
 14494	to the Emperor shocked RostÃ³v. RostÃ³v saw how the Emperorâs rather
 14495	round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his
 14496	left foot began convulsively tapping the horseâs side with the spur,
 14497	and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not
 14498	stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to
 14499	place him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.
 14500	
 14501	âGently, gently! Canât you do it more gently?â said the Emperor
 14502	apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.
 14503	
 14504	RostÃ³v saw tears filling the Emperorâs eyes and heard him, as he was
 14505	riding away, say to CzartorÃ½ski: âWhat a terrible thing war is: what
 14506	a terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!â
 14507	
 14508	The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight
 14509	of the enemyâs lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us
 14510	at the least firing. The Emperorâs gratitude was announced to the
 14511	vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of
 14512	vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiersâ songs resounded
 14513	even more merrily than on the previous night. DenÃ­sov celebrated his
 14514	promotion to the rank of major, and RostÃ³v, who had already drunk
 14515	enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperorâs health. âNot
 14516	âour Sovereign, the Emperor,â as they say at official dinners,â
 14517	said he, âbut the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and
 14518	great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the
 14519	French!â
 14520	
 14521	âIf we fought before,â he said, ânot letting the French pass, as
 14522	at SchÃ¶n Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We
 14523	will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not
 14524	saying it right, I have drunk a good dealâbut that is how I feel, and
 14525	so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!â
 14526	
 14527	âHurrah!â rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.
 14528	
 14529	And the old cavalry captain, KÃ­rsten, shouted enthusiastically and no
 14530	less sincerely than the twenty-year-old RostÃ³v.
 14531	
 14532	When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, KÃ­rsten filled
 14533	others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the
 14534	soldiersâ bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest
 14535	showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light
 14536	of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.
 14537	
 14538	âLads! hereâs to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over
 14539	our enemies! Hurrah!â he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussarâs
 14540	baritone.
 14541	
 14542	The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.
 14543	
 14544	Late that night, when all had separated, DenÃ­sov with his short hand
 14545	patted his favorite, RostÃ³v, on the shoulder.
 14546	
 14547	âAs thereâs no one to fall in love with on campaign, heâs fallen
 14548	in love with the Tsar,â he said.
 14549	
 14550	âDenÃ­sov, donât make fun of it!â cried RostÃ³v. âIt is such a
 14551	lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...â
 14552	
 14553	âI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...â
 14554	
 14555	âNo, you donât understand!â
 14556	
 14557	And RostÃ³v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of
 14558	what happiness it would be to dieânot in saving the Emperorâs life
 14559	(he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his
 14560	eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian
 14561	arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to
 14562	experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
 14563	of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in
 14564	love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the
 14565	Russian arms.
 14566	
 14567	
 14568	
 14569	
 14570	
 14571	CHAPTER XI
 14572	
 14573	The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,
 14574	was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops
 14575	near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and
 14576	had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this
 14577	indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by
 14578	the sight of the killed and wounded.
 14579	
 14580	At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with
 14581	a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was
 14582	brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The
 14583	Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday
 14584	he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with
 14585	Prince DolgorÃºkov to the advanced post of the French army.
 14586	
 14587	It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander
 14588	a meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a
 14589	personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince
 14590	DolgorÃºkov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate
 14591	with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were
 14592	actuated by a real desire for peace.
 14593	
 14594	Toward evening DolgorÃºkov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and
 14595	remained alone with him for a long time.
 14596	
 14597	On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two
 14598	daysâ march and the enemyâs outposts after a brief interchange
 14599	of shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the
 14600	nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till
 14601	the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz
 14602	was fought.
 14603	
 14604	Till midday on the nineteenth, the activityâthe eager talk, running to
 14605	and fro, and dispatching of adjutantsâwas confined to the Emperorâs
 14606	headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached
 14607	KutÃºzovâs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns.
 14608	By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the
 14609	army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole
 14610	eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of
 14611	voices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles
 14612	long.
 14613	
 14614	The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperorâs
 14615	headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that
 14616	followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower
 14617	clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third,
 14618	and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to
 14619	work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with
 14620	regular motion as a result of all that activity.
 14621	
 14622	Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military
 14623	machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as
 14624	indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted
 14625	to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet
 14626	reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and
 14627	the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a
 14628	neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared
 14629	to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever
 14630	catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins
 14631	in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.
 14632	
 14633	Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable
 14634	wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the
 14635	hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human
 14636	activities of 160,000 Russians and Frenchâall their passions, desires,
 14637	remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and
 14638	enthusiasmâwas only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the
 14639	so-called battle of the three Emperorsâthat is to say, a slow movement
 14640	of the hand on the dial of human history.
 14641	
 14642	Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
 14643	commander in chief.
 14644	
 14645	At six in the evening, KutÃºzov went to the Emperorâs headquarters
 14646	and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand
 14647	marshal of the court, Count TolstÃ³y.
 14648	
 14649	BolkÃ³nski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the
 14650	coming action from DolgorÃºkov. He felt that KutÃºzov was upset
 14651	and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were
 14652	dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperorâs headquarters
 14653	everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do
 14654	not know: he therefore wished to speak to DolgorÃºkov.
 14655	
 14656	âWell, how dâyou do, my dear fellow?â said DolgorÃºkov, who was
 14657	sitting at tea with BilÃ­bin. âThe fete is for tomorrow. How is your
 14658	old fellow? Out of sorts?â
 14659	
 14660	âI wonât say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be
 14661	heard.â
 14662	
 14663	âBut they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he
 14664	talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte
 14665	fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.â
 14666	
 14667	âYes, you have seen him?â said Prince Andrew. âWell, what is
 14668	Bonaparte like? How did he impress you?â
 14669	
 14670	âYes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as
 14671	a general engagement,â repeated DolgorÃºkov, evidently prizing this
 14672	general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with
 14673	Napoleon. âIf he werenât afraid of a battle why did he ask for that
 14674	interview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is
 14675	so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid,
 14676	afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!â
 14677	
 14678	âBut tell me, what is he like, eh?â said Prince Andrew again.
 14679	
 14680	âHe is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call
 14681	him âYour Majesty,â but who, to his chagrin, got no title from
 14682	me! Thatâs the sort of man he is, and nothing more,â replied
 14683	DolgorÃºkov, looking round at BilÃ­bin with a smile.
 14684	
 14685	âDespite my great respect for old KutÃºzov,â he continued, âwe
 14686	should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him
 14687	a chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in
 14688	our hands! No, we mustnât forget SuvÃ³rov and his ruleânot to put
 14689	yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe
 14690	me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all
 14691	the experience of old Cunctators.â
 14692	
 14693	âBut in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the
 14694	outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are
 14695	situated,â said Prince Andrew.
 14696	
 14697	He wished to explain to DolgorÃºkov a plan of attack he had himself
 14698	formed.
 14699	
 14700	âOh, that is all the same,â DolgorÃºkov said quickly, and getting up
 14701	he spread a map on the table. âAll eventualities have been foreseen.
 14702	If he is standing before BrÃ¼nn...â
 14703	
 14704	And Prince DolgorÃºkov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrotherâs
 14705	plan of a flanking movement.
 14706	
 14707	Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might
 14708	have been as good as Weyrotherâs, but for the disadvantage that
 14709	Weyrotherâs had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began
 14710	to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan,
 14711	Prince DolgorÃºkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not
 14712	at the map, but at Prince Andrewâs face.
 14713	
 14714	âThere will be a council of war at KutÃºzovâs tonight, though; you
 14715	can say all this there,â remarked DolgorÃºkov.
 14716	
 14717	âI will do so,â said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.
 14718	
 14719	âWhatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?â said BilÃ­bin, who,
 14720	till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and
 14721	now was evidently ready with a joke. âWhether tomorrow brings
 14722	victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your
 14723	KutÃºzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The
 14724	commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de
 14725	Lichtenstein, le Prince de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on
 14726	like all those Polish names.â
 14727	
 14728	âBe quiet, backbiter!â said DolgorÃºkov. âIt is not true; there
 14729	are now two Russians, MilorÃ¡dovich, and DokhtÃºrov, and there would be
 14730	a third, Count ArakchÃ©ev, if his nerves were not too weak.â
 14731	
 14732	âHowever, I think General KutÃºzov has come out,â said Prince
 14733	Andrew. âI wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!â he added and
 14734	went out after shaking hands with DolgorÃºkov and BilÃ­bin.
 14735	
 14736	On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking KutÃºzov,
 14737	who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrowâs
 14738	battle.
 14739	
 14740	KutÃºzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied:
 14741	âI think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count TolstÃ³y and
 14742	asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? âBut, my
 14743	dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military
 14744	matters yourself!â Yes... That was the answer I got!â
 14745	
 14746	
 14747	
 14748	
 14749	
 14750	CHAPTER XII
 14751	
 14752	Shortly after nine oâclock that evening, Weyrother drove with his
 14753	plans to KutÃºzovâs quarters where the council of war was to be
 14754	held. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in
 14755	chiefâs and with the exception of Prince BagratiÃ³n, who declined to
 14756	come, were all there at the appointed time.
 14757	
 14758	Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his
 14759	eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
 14760	and drowsy KutÃºzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
 14761	president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be
 14762	at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was
 14763	like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was
 14764	pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at
 14765	headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead
 14766	to. Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemyâs picket
 14767	line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and
 14768	Austrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had
 14769	dictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived
 14770	at KutÃºzovâs.
 14771	
 14772	He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
 14773	commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly,
 14774	without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to
 14775	questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful,
 14776	weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and
 14777	self-confident.
 14778	
 14779	KutÃºzov was occupying a noblemanâs castle of modest dimensions near
 14780	Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander
 14781	in chiefâs office were gathered KutÃºzov himself, Weyrother, and the
 14782	members of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited
 14783	Prince BagratiÃ³n to begin the council. At last BagratiÃ³nâs orderly
 14784	came with the news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came
 14785	in to inform the commander in chief of this and, availing himself
 14786	of permission previously given him by KutÃºzov to be present at the
 14787	council, he remained in the room.
 14788	
 14789	âSince Prince BagratiÃ³n is not coming, we may begin,â said
 14790	Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on
 14791	which an enormous map of the environs of BrÃ¼nn was spread out.
 14792	
 14793	KutÃºzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over
 14794	his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair,
 14795	with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound
 14796	of Weyrotherâs voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.
 14797	
 14798	âYes, yes, if you please! It is already late,â said he, and nodding
 14799	his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.
 14800	
 14801	If at first the members of the council thought that KutÃºzov was
 14802	pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that
 14803	followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed
 14804	by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for
 14805	the dispositions or anything elseâhe was engaged in satisfying the
 14806	irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with
 14807	the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at KutÃºzov and,
 14808	having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in
 14809	a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the
 14810	impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:
 14811	
 14812	âDispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and
 14813	Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.â
 14814	
 14815	The dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as
 14816	follows:
 14817	
 14818	âAs the enemyâs left wing rests on wooded hills and his right
 14819	extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there,
 14820	while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his
 14821	right, it is advantageous to attack the enemyâs latter wing especially
 14822	if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we
 14823	can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between
 14824	Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of
 14825	Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemyâs front. For this
 14826	object it is necessary that... The first column marches... The second
 14827	column marches... The third column marches...â and so on, read
 14828	Weyrother.
 14829	
 14830	The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.
 14831	The tall, fair-haired General BuxhÃ¶wden stood, leaning his back against
 14832	the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen
 14833	or even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother,
 14834	with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache
 14835	twisted upwards, sat the ruddy MilorÃ¡dovich in a military pose, his
 14836	elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders
 14837	raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrotherâs face,
 14838	and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished
 14839	reading. Then MilorÃ¡dovich looked round significantly at the other
 14840	generals. But one could not tell from that significant look whether he
 14841	agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next
 14842	to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left
 14843	his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading,
 14844	gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners
 14845	a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the
 14846	longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised
 14847	his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his
 14848	thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the
 14849	Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his
 14850	elbows, as if to say: âYou can tell me your views later, but now be so
 14851	good as to look at the map and listen.â Langeron lifted his eyes with
 14852	an expression of perplexity, turned round to MilorÃ¡dovich as if seeking
 14853	an explanation, but meeting the latterâs impressive but meaningless
 14854	gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.
 14855	
 14856	âA geography lesson!â he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough
 14857	to be heard.
 14858	
 14859	PrzebyszÃ©wski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his
 14860	hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in
 14861	attention. DohktÃºrov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with
 14862	an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map
 14863	conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He
 14864	asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard
 14865	and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother complied and DohktÃºrov
 14866	noted them down.
 14867	
 14868	When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again
 14869	brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at
 14870	anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out
 14871	such a plan in which the enemyâs position was assumed to be known,
 14872	whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement.
 14873	Langeronâs objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief
 14874	aim was to show General Weyrotherâwho had read his dispositions with
 14875	as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school childrenâthat
 14876	he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something
 14877	in military matters.
 14878	
 14879	When the monotonous sound of Weyrotherâs voice ceased, KutÃºzov opened
 14880	his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel
 14881	is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking,
 14882	âSo you are still at that silly business!â quickly closed his eye
 14883	again, and let his head sink still lower.
 14884	
 14885	Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrotherâs vanity
 14886	as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily
 14887	attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this
 14888	plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and
 14889	contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
 14890	be they what they might.
 14891	
 14892	âIf he could attack us, he would have done so today,â said he.
 14893	
 14894	âSo you think he is powerless?â said Langeron.
 14895	
 14896	âHe has forty thousand men at most,â replied Weyrother, with the
 14897	smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of
 14898	a case.
 14899	
 14900	âIn that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,â said
 14901	Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support
 14902	to MilorÃ¡dovich who was near him.
 14903	
 14904	But MilorÃ¡dovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
 14905	rather than of what the generals were disputing about.
 14906	
 14907	âMa foi!â said he, âtomorrow we shall see all that on the
 14908	battlefield.â
 14909	
 14910	Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was
 14911	strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to
 14912	have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but
 14913	had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.
 14914	
 14915	âThe enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from
 14916	his camp,â said he. âWhat does that mean? Either he is retreating,
 14917	which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.â
 14918	(He smiled ironically.) âBut even if he also took up a position in
 14919	the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our
 14920	arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same.â
 14921	
 14922	âHow is that?...â began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting
 14923	an opportunity to express his doubts.
 14924	
 14925	KutÃºzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the
 14926	generals.
 14927	
 14928	âGentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrowâor rather for today, for
 14929	it is past midnightâcannot now be altered,â said he. âYou have
 14930	heard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is
 14931	nothing more important...â he paused, âthan to have a good sleep.â
 14932	
 14933	He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past
 14934	midnight. Prince Andrew went out.
 14935	
 14936	The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to
 14937	express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy
 14938	impression. Whether DolgorÃºkov and Weyrother, or KutÃºzov, Langeron,
 14939	and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were
 14940	rightâhe did not know. âBut was it really not possible for KutÃºzov
 14941	to state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on
 14942	account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives,
 14943	and my life, my life,â he thought, âmust be risked?â
 14944	
 14945	âYes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,â he
 14946	thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most
 14947	distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered
 14948	his last parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days
 14949	when he first loved her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for
 14950	her and for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he
 14951	went out of the hut in which he was billeted with NesvÃ­tski and began
 14952	to walk up and down before it.
 14953	
 14954	The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed
 14955	mysteriously. âYes, tomorrow, tomorrow!â he thought. âTomorrow
 14956	everything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none
 14957	of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly,
 14958	I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all
 14959	I can do.â And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the
 14960	concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the
 14961	commanders. And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had
 14962	so long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly
 14963	expresses his opinion to KutÃºzov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors.
 14964	All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to
 14965	carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a divisionâstipulates that no
 14966	one is to interfere with his arrangementsâleads his division to
 14967	the decisive point, and gains the victory alone. âBut death and
 14968	suffering?â suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not
 14969	answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. The dispositions
 14970	for the next battle are planned by him alone. Nominally he is only an
 14971	adjutant on KutÃºzovâs staff, but he does everything alone. The next
 14972	battle is won by him alone. KutÃºzov is removed and he is appointed...
 14973	âWell and then?â asked the other voice. âIf before that you are
 14974	not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?...â
 14975	âWell then,â Prince Andrew answered himself, âI donât know
 14976	what will happen and donât want to know, and canât, but if I want
 14977	thisâwant glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by them, it
 14978	is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only
 14979	for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God!
 14980	what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and menâs esteem? Death,
 14981	wounds, the loss of familyâI fear nothing. And precious and dear
 14982	as many persons are to meâfather, sister, wifeâthose dearest to
 14983	meâyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at
 14984	once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I
 14985	donât know and never shall know, for the love of these men here,â he
 14986	thought, as he listened to voices in KutÃºzovâs courtyard. The voices
 14987	were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a
 14988	coachmanâs, was teasing KutÃºzovâs old cook whom Prince Andrew knew,
 14989	and who was called Tit. He was saying, âTit, I say, Tit!â
 14990	
 14991	âWell?â returned the old man.
 14992	
 14993	âGo, Tit, thresh a bit!â said the wag.
 14994	
 14995	âOh, go to the devil!â called out a voice, drowned by the laughter
 14996	of the orderlies and servants.
 14997	
 14998	âAll the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I
 14999	value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this
 15000	mist!â
 15001	
 15002	
 15003	
 15004	
 15005	
 15006	CHAPTER XIII
 15007	
 15008	That same night, RostÃ³v was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
 15009	of BagratiÃ³nâs detachment. His hussars were placed along the line
 15010	in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the
 15011	sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our
 15012	armyâs campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him;
 15013	in front of him was misty darkness. RostÃ³v could see nothing, peer as
 15014	he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray, now there
 15015	was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy
 15016	ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His
 15017	eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appearedânow the Emperor, now
 15018	DenÃ­sov, and now Moscow memoriesâand he again hurriedly opened his
 15019	eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was
 15020	riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the
 15021	black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty
 15022	darkness. âWhy not?... It might easily happen,â thought RostÃ³v,
 15023	âthat the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any
 15024	other officer; heâll say: âGo and find out whatâs there.â There
 15025	are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance
 15026	way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near him?
 15027	Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would
 15028	unmask his deceivers!â And in order to realize vividly his love
 15029	devotion to the sovereign, RostÃ³v pictured to himself an enemy or a
 15030	deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom
 15031	he would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout
 15032	aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.
 15033	
 15034	âWhere am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and
 15035	watchwordâshaft, OlmÃ¼tz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in
 15036	reserve tomorrow,â he thought. âIâll ask leave to go to the front,
 15037	this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It wonât be long
 15038	now before I am off duty. Iâll take another turn and when I get back
 15039	Iâll go to the general and ask him.â He readjusted himself in the
 15040	saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It
 15041	seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping
 15042	descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a
 15043	wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that RostÃ³v could not at
 15044	all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some
 15045	unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on
 15046	that white spot. âI expect itâs snow... that spot... a spotâune
 15047	tache,â he thought. âThere now... itâs not a tache... NatÃ¡sha...
 15048	sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Wonât she be surprised when
 15049	I tell her how Iâve seen the Emperor?) NatÃ¡sha... take my
 15050	sabretache...âââKeep to the right, your honor, there are bushes
 15051	here,â came the voice of an hussar, past whom RostÃ³v was riding in
 15052	the act of falling asleep. RostÃ³v lifted his head that had sunk almost
 15053	to his horseâs mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was succumbing
 15054	to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. âBut what was I
 15055	thinking? I mustnât forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No,
 15056	thatâs not itâthatâs tomorrow. Oh yes! NatÃ¡sha... sabretache...
 15057	saber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along
 15058	the TverskÃ¡ya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about
 15059	him too, just opposite GÃºryevâs house... Old GÃºryev.... Oh, but
 15060	DenÃ­sovâs a fine fellow. But thatâs all nonsense. The chief thing
 15061	is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to say
 15062	something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But thatâs
 15063	nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important thing I
 15064	was thinking of. Yes, Na-tÃ¡sha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! Thatâs
 15065	right!â And his head once more sank to his horseâs neck. All at once
 15066	it seemed to him that he was being fired at. âWhat? What? What?... Cut
 15067	them down! What?...â said RostÃ³v, waking up. At the moment he opened
 15068	his eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn
 15069	shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar
 15070	near him pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the
 15071	shouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another,
 15072	and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the
 15073	shouting grew louder and louder. RostÃ³v could hear the sound of French
 15074	words but could not distinguish them. The din of many voices was too
 15075	great; all he could hear was: âahahah!â and ârrrr!â
 15076	
 15077	âWhatâs that? What do you make of it?â said RostÃ³v to the hussar
 15078	beside him. âThat must be the enemyâs camp!â
 15079	
 15080	The hussar did not reply.
 15081	
 15082	âWhy, donât you hear it?â RostÃ³v asked again, after waiting for a
 15083	reply.
 15084	
 15085	âWho can tell, your honor?â replied the hussar reluctantly.
 15086	
 15087	âFrom the direction, it must be the enemy,â repeated RostÃ³v.
 15088	
 15089	âIt may be he or it may be nothing,â muttered the hussar. âItâs
 15090	dark... Steady!â he cried to his fidgeting horse.
 15091	
 15092	RostÃ³vâs horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,
 15093	pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting
 15094	grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army
 15095	of several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and
 15096	farther, probably along the line of the French camp. RostÃ³v no longer
 15097	wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a
 15098	stimulating effect on him. âVive lâEmpereur! lâEmpereur!â he now
 15099	heard distinctly.
 15100	
 15101	âThey canât be far off, probably just beyond the stream,â he said
 15102	to the hussar beside him.
 15103	
 15104	The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound
 15105	of horseâs hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was
 15106	heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars
 15107	suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.
 15108	
 15109	âYour honor, the generals!â said the sergeant, riding up to RostÃ³v.
 15110	
 15111	RostÃ³v, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with
 15112	the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line.
 15113	One was on a white horse. Prince BagratiÃ³n and Prince DolgorÃºkov with
 15114	their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the
 15115	lights and shouts in the enemyâs camp. RostÃ³v rode up to BagratiÃ³n,
 15116	reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the
 15117	generals were saying.
 15118	
 15119	âBelieve me,â said Prince DolgorÃºkov, addressing BagratiÃ³n, âit
 15120	is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to
 15121	kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us.â
 15122	
 15123	âHardly,â said BagratiÃ³n. âI saw them this evening on that
 15124	knoll; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too....
 15125	Officer!â said BagratiÃ³n to RostÃ³v, âare the enemyâs skirmishers
 15126	still there?â
 15127	
 15128	âThey were there this evening, but now I donât know, your
 15129	excellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?â replied
 15130	RostÃ³v.
 15131	
 15132	BagratiÃ³n stopped and, before replying, tried to see RostÃ³vâs face
 15133	in the mist.
 15134	
 15135	âWell, go and see,â he said, after a pause.
 15136	
 15137	âYes, sir.â
 15138	
 15139	RostÃ³v spurred his horse, called to Sergeant FÃ©dchenko and two other
 15140	hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction
 15141	from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be
 15142	riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty
 15143	distance where no one had been before him. BagratiÃ³n called to him from
 15144	the hill not to go beyond the stream, but RostÃ³v pretended not to hear
 15145	him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes
 15146	for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes.
 15147	Having descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or
 15148	the enemyâs fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly
 15149	and distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river,
 15150	but when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto
 15151	the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or
 15152	cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the
 15153	road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it
 15154	would be easier to see people coming along it. âFollow me!â said he,
 15155	crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the
 15156	point where the French pickets had been standing that evening.
 15157	
 15158	âYour honor, there he is!â cried one of the hussars behind him. And
 15159	before RostÃ³v had time to make out what the black thing was that had
 15160	suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report,
 15161	and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed
 15162	out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan.
 15163	RostÃ³v turned his horse and galloped back. Four more reports followed
 15164	at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
 15165	different tones. RostÃ³v reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen,
 15166	like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. âWell, some
 15167	more! Some more!â a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no more
 15168	shots came.
 15169	
 15170	Only when approaching BagratiÃ³n did RostÃ³v let his horse gallop again,
 15171	and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.
 15172	
 15173	DolgorÃºkov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had
 15174	only lit fires to deceive us.
 15175	
 15176	âWhat does that prove?â he was saying as RostÃ³v rode up. âThey
 15177	might retreat and leave the pickets.â
 15178	
 15179	âItâs plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,â said
 15180	BagratiÃ³n. âWait till tomorrow morning, weâll find out everything
 15181	tomorrow.â
 15182	
 15183	âThe picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was
 15184	in the evening,â reported RostÃ³v, stooping forward with his hand at
 15185	the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his
 15186	ride and especially by the sound of the bullets.
 15187	
 15188	âVery good, very good,â said BagratiÃ³n. âThank you, officer.â
 15189	
 15190	âYour excellency,â said RostÃ³v, âmay I ask a favor?â
 15191	
 15192	âWhat is it?â
 15193	
 15194	âTomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached
 15195	to the first squadron?â
 15196	
 15197	âWhatâs your name?â
 15198	
 15199	âCount RostÃ³v.â
 15200	
 15201	âOh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.â
 15202	
 15203	âCount IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³vâs son?â asked DolgorÃºkov.
 15204	
 15205	But RostÃ³v did not reply.
 15206	
 15207	âThen I may reckon on it, your excellency?â
 15208	
 15209	âI will give the order.â
 15210	
 15211	âTomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the
 15212	Emperor,â thought RostÃ³v.
 15213	
 15214	âThank God!â
 15215	
 15216	The fires and shouting in the enemyâs army were occasioned by the fact
 15217	that while Napoleonâs proclamation was being read to the troops the
 15218	Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him,
 15219	lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, âVive lâEmpereur!â
 15220	Napoleonâs proclamation was as follows:
 15221	
 15222	Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
 15223	Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at
 15224	HollabrÃ¼nn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we
 15225	occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on
 15226	the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct
 15227	your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual
 15228	valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemyâs ranks, but should
 15229	victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor
 15230	exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no
 15231	doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the
 15232	honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.
 15233	
 15234	Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every
 15235	man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings
 15236	of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will
 15237	conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh
 15238	French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace
 15239	I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.
 15240	
 15241	NAPOLEON
 15242	
 15243	
 15244	
 15245	
 15246	CHAPTER XIV
 15247	
 15248	At five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the
 15249	center, the reserves, and BagratiÃ³nâs right flank had not yet moved,
 15250	but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,
 15251	which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French
 15252	right flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan,
 15253	were already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they
 15254	were throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold
 15255	and dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the
 15256	soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to
 15257	warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
 15258	remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they
 15259	did not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides
 15260	were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds
 15261	of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near
 15262	a commanding officerâs quarters, the regiment began to move: the
 15263	soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their
 15264	bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank. The
 15265	officers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches,
 15266	and moved along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies
 15267	harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and
 15268	battalion and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave
 15269	final instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men
 15270	who remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet
 15271	resounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and unable,
 15272	from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see
 15273	either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going.
 15274	
 15275	A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as
 15276	much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever
 15277	strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is
 15278	always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so
 15279	the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the
 15280	same sergeant major IvÃ¡n MÃ­trich, the same company dog Jack, and the
 15281	same commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which
 15282	his ship is sailing, but on the day of battleâheaven knows how and
 15283	whenceâa stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral
 15284	atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive
 15285	and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of
 15286	battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
 15287	regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning
 15288	what is going on around them.
 15289	
 15290	The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
 15291	not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level
 15292	ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might
 15293	encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced
 15294	for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills,
 15295	avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and
 15296	nowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became
 15297	aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns
 15298	were moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that
 15299	to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going
 15300	too.
 15301	
 15302	âThere now, the KÃºrskies have also gone past,â was being said in
 15303	the ranks.
 15304	
 15305	âItâs wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last
 15306	night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular
 15307	Moscow!â
 15308	
 15309	Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to
 15310	the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of
 15311	humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves
 15312	to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops
 15313	marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to
 15314	an attack. But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog,
 15315	the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
 15316	of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such
 15317	a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it
 15318	certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly,
 15319	and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been
 15320	alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before
 15321	this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as
 15322	it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
 15323	Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
 15324	occasioned by the sausage eaters.
 15325	
 15326	âWhy have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up
 15327	against the French?â
 15328	
 15329	âNo, one canât hear them. Theyâd be firing if we had.â
 15330	
 15331	âThey were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in
 15332	the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. Itâs all those damned
 15333	Germansâ muddling! What stupid devils!â
 15334	
 15335	âYes, Iâd send them on in front, but no fear, theyâre crowding up
 15336	behind. And now here we stand hungry.â
 15337	
 15338	âI say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the
 15339	way,â said an officer.
 15340	
 15341	âAh, those damned Germans! They donât know their own country!â
 15342	said another.
 15343	
 15344	âWhat division are you?â shouted an adjutant, riding up.
 15345	
 15346	âThe Eighteenth.â
 15347	
 15348	âThen why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you
 15349	wonât get there till evening.â
 15350	
 15351	âWhat stupid orders! They donât themselves know what they are
 15352	doing!â said the officer and rode off.
 15353	
 15354	Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.
 15355	
 15356	âTafa-lafa! But what heâs jabbering no one can make out,â said a
 15357	soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. âIâd shoot them,
 15358	the scoundrels!â
 15359	
 15360	âWe were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we havenât got
 15361	halfway. Fine orders!â was being repeated on different sides.
 15362	
 15363	And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
 15364	turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
 15365	Germans.
 15366	
 15367	The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was
 15368	moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center
 15369	was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
 15370	ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in
 15371	front of the infantry, who had to wait.
 15372	
 15373	At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a
 15374	Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be
 15375	halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to
 15376	blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After
 15377	an hourâs delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog
 15378	that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they
 15379	were descending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another,
 15380	at first irregularly at varying intervalsâtrata...tatâand then more
 15381	and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream
 15382	began.
 15383	
 15384	Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having
 15385	stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their
 15386	commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through
 15387	the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around
 15388	them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy
 15389	lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from
 15390	the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown
 15391	surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action
 15392	began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into
 15393	the valley. The fourth column, with which KutÃºzov was, stood on the
 15394	Pratzen Heights.
 15395	
 15396	Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the
 15397	higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was
 15398	going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed,
 15399	six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one
 15400	knew till after eight oâclock.
 15401	
 15402	It was nine oâclock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea
 15403	down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon
 15404	stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was
 15405	a clear blue sky, and the sunâs vast orb quivered like a huge hollow,
 15406	crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French
 15407	army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side
 15408	of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we
 15409	intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this
 15410	side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could
 15411	distinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak
 15412	which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab
 15413	horse a little in front of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills
 15414	which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian
 15415	troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of
 15416	firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of his faceâwhich in those
 15417	days was still thinâmoved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on
 15418	one spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian
 15419	force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes
 15420	and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack
 15421	and regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that in
 15422	a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian
 15423	columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one
 15424	direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into
 15425	the mist. From information he had received the evening before, from the
 15426	sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night,
 15427	by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all
 15428	indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away
 15429	in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted
 15430	the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already
 15431	sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not
 15432	begin the engagement.
 15433	
 15434	Today was a great day for himâthe anniversary of his coronation.
 15435	Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and
 15436	in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field
 15437	in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything
 15438	succeeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above
 15439	the mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident,
 15440	self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily
 15441	in love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his
 15442	attention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating
 15443	up out of the mist.
 15444	
 15445	When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were
 15446	aglow with dazzling lightâas if he had only awaited this to begin the
 15447	actionâhe drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign
 15448	with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The marshals,
 15449	accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and
 15450	a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly
 15451	toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by
 15452	Russian troops moving down the valley to their left.
 15453	
 15454	
 15455	
 15456	
 15457	
 15458	CHAPTER XV
 15459	
 15460	At eight oâclock KutÃºzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth
 15461	column, MilorÃ¡dovichâs, the one that was to take the place of
 15462	PrzebyszÃ©wskiâs and Langeronâs columns which had already gone down
 15463	into the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave
 15464	them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead
 15465	that column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he
 15466	halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the
 15467	commander in chiefâs suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement
 15468	and irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of
 15469	a long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of
 15470	his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not
 15471	know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality and the position of
 15472	our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone
 15473	in our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now
 15474	be carried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrotherâs plan,
 15475	Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects
 15476	such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.
 15477	
 15478	To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces
 15479	could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would
 15480	concentrate. âThere we shall encounter difficulties, and there,â
 15481	thought he, âI shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there,
 15482	standard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of
 15483	me.â
 15484	
 15485	He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.
 15486	Seeing them he kept thinking, âThat may be the very standard with
 15487	which I shall lead the army.â
 15488	
 15489	In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was
 15490	a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a
 15491	milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which
 15492	our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing.
 15493	Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb
 15494	of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist,
 15495	some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably
 15496	was, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were
 15497	entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and
 15498	then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses
 15499	of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and
 15500	behind moved infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end of
 15501	the village letting the troops pass by him. That morning KutÃºzov seemed
 15502	worn and irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt
 15503	without any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in
 15504	front.
 15505	
 15506	âDo order them to form into battalion columns and go round the
 15507	village!â he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. âDonât
 15508	you understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not
 15509	defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the
 15510	enemy?â
 15511	
 15512	âI intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,â
 15513	answered the general.
 15514	
 15515	KutÃºzov laughed bitterly.
 15516	
 15517	âYouâll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy!
 15518	Very fine!â
 15519	
 15520	âThe enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the
 15521	dispositions...â
 15522	
 15523	âThe dispositions!â exclaimed KutÃºzov bitterly. âWho told you
 15524	that?... Kindly do as you are ordered.â
 15525	
 15526	âYes, sir.â
 15527	
 15528	âMy dear fellow,â NesvÃ­tski whispered to Prince Andrew, âthe old
 15529	man is as surly as a dog.â
 15530	
 15531	An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat
 15532	galloped up to KutÃºzov and asked in the Emperorâs name had the fourth
 15533	column advanced into action.
 15534	
 15535	KutÃºzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall
 15536	upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, KutÃºzovâs
 15537	malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what
 15538	was being done was not his adjutantâs fault, and still not answering
 15539	the Austrian adjutant, he addressed BolkÃ³nski.
 15540	
 15541	âGo, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the
 15542	village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.â
 15543	
 15544	Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.
 15545	
 15546	âAnd ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,â he added. âWhat
 15547	are they doing? What are they doing?â he murmured to himself, still
 15548	not replying to the Austrian.
 15549	
 15550	Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.
 15551	
 15552	Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped
 15553	the third division and convinced himself that there really were no
 15554	sharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of the
 15555	regiment was much surprised at the commander in chiefâs order to throw
 15556	out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops
 15557	in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away.
 15558	There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent
 15559	hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chiefâs
 15560	name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. KutÃºzov
 15561	still in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle
 15562	with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes. The
 15563	troops were no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets
 15564	on the ground.
 15565	
 15566	âAll right, all right!â he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a
 15567	general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all
 15568	the left-flank columns had already descended.
 15569	
 15570	âPlenty of time, your excellency,â muttered KutÃºzov in the midst of
 15571	a yawn. âPlenty of time,â he repeated.
 15572	
 15573	Just then at a distance behind KutÃºzov was heard the sound of regiments
 15574	saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended
 15575	line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were
 15576	greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front
 15577	of which KutÃºzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one
 15578	side and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped
 15579	what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them
 15580	rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with
 15581	white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who
 15582	was in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors
 15583	followed by their suites. KutÃºzov, affecting the manners of an old
 15584	soldier at the front, gave the command âAttention!â and rode up
 15585	to the Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance and manner were
 15586	suddenly transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys
 15587	without reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently struck
 15588	Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.
 15589	
 15590	This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face
 15591	of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished.
 15592	After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field
 15593	of OlmÃ¼tz where BolkÃ³nski had seen him for the first time abroad, but
 15594	there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness
 15595	in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for
 15596	varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted
 15597	innocent youth.
 15598	
 15599	At the OlmÃ¼tz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed
 15600	brighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two
 15601	miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round
 15602	at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own. CzartorÃ½ski,
 15603	NovosÃ­ltsev, Prince VolkÃ³nsky, StrÃ³gonov, and the others, all richly
 15604	dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly
 15605	heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the
 15606	Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very
 15607	erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and
 15608	preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked
 15609	some questionââMost likely he is asking at what oâclock they
 15610	started,â thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with
 15611	a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at BrÃ¼nn.
 15612	In the Emperorsâ suite were the picked young orderly officers of the
 15613	Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were grooms
 15614	leading the Tsarâs beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered
 15615	cloths.
 15616	
 15617	As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters
 15618	a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of
 15619	success reached KutÃºzovâs cheerless staff with the galloping advent
 15620	of all these brilliant young men.
 15621	
 15622	âWhy arenât you beginning, Michael IlariÃ³novich?â said the
 15623	Emperor Alexander hurriedly to KutÃºzov, glancing courteously at the
 15624	same time at the Emperor Francis.
 15625	
 15626	âI am waiting, Your Majesty,â answered KutÃºzov, bending forward
 15627	respectfully.
 15628	
 15629	The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not
 15630	quite heard.
 15631	
 15632	âWaiting, Your Majesty,â repeated KutÃºzov. (Prince Andrew noted
 15633	that KutÃºzovâs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the
 15634	word âwaiting.â) âNot all the columns have formed up yet, Your
 15635	Majesty.â
 15636	
 15637	The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his
 15638	rather round shoulders and glanced at NovosÃ­ltsev who was near him, as
 15639	if complaining of KutÃºzov.
 15640	
 15641	âYou know, Michael IlariÃ³novich, we are not on the Empressâ Field
 15642	where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,â said
 15643	the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting
 15644	him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the
 15645	Emperor Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.
 15646	
 15647	âThat is just why I do not begin, sire,â said KutÃºzov in a
 15648	resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being
 15649	heard, and again something in his face twitchedââThat is just why
 15650	I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the
 15651	Empressâ Field,â said he clearly and distinctly.
 15652	
 15653	In the Emperorâs suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
 15654	dissatisfaction and reproach. âOld though he may be, he should not, he
 15655	certainly should not, speak like that,â their glances seemed to say.
 15656	
 15657	The Tsar looked intently and observantly into KutÃºzovâs eye
 15658	waiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But KutÃºzov, with
 15659	respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted
 15660	for about a minute.
 15661	
 15662	âHowever, if you command it, Your Majesty,â said KutÃºzov, lifting
 15663	his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but
 15664	submissive general.
 15665	
 15666	He touched his horse and having called MilorÃ¡dovich, the commander of
 15667	the column, gave him the order to advance.
 15668	
 15669	The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the NÃ³vgorod and
 15670	one of the Ãpsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.
 15671	
 15672	As this Ãpsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced MilorÃ¡dovich,
 15673	without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous
 15674	tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front
 15675	and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined
 15676	in his horse before the Emperor.
 15677	
 15678	âGod be with you, general!â said the Emperor.
 15679	
 15680	âMa foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilitÃ©,
 15681	sire,â * he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among
 15682	the gentlemen of the Tsarâs suite by his poor French.
 15683	
 15684	     * âIndeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to
 15685	     do, Sire.â
 15686	
 15687	
 15688	MilorÃ¡dovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little
 15689	behind the Emperor. The Ãpsheron men, excited by the Tsarâs presence,
 15690	passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk
 15691	pace.
 15692	
 15693	âLads!â shouted MilorÃ¡dovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery
 15694	voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of
 15695	battle, and by the sight of the gallant Ãpsherons, his comrades in
 15696	SuvÃ³rovâs time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he
 15697	forgot the sovereignsâ presence. âLads, itâs not the first village
 15698	youâve had to take,â cried he.
 15699	
 15700	âGlad to do our best!â shouted the soldiers.
 15701	
 15702	The Emperorâs horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had
 15703	carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the
 15704	field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and
 15705	pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
 15706	Empressâ Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor
 15707	of the nearness of the Emperor Francisâ black cob, nor of all that was
 15708	being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.
 15709	
 15710	The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
 15711	remark to him, pointing to the gallant Ãpsherons.
 15712	
 15713	
 15714	
 15715	
 15716	
 15717	CHAPTER XVI
 15718	
 15719	KutÃºzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the
 15720	carabineers.
 15721	
 15722	When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he
 15723	stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an
 15724	inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were
 15725	marching along both.
 15726	
 15727	The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible
 15728	about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on
 15729	the left, the firing became more distinct. KutÃºzov had stopped and was
 15730	speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind
 15731	looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.
 15732	
 15733	âLook, look!â said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the
 15734	distance, but down the hill before him. âItâs the French!â
 15735	
 15736	The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying
 15737	to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces
 15738	suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a
 15739	mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
 15740	front of us.
 15741	
 15742	âItâs the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But
 15743	how is that?â said different voices.
 15744	
 15745	With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more
 15746	than five hundred paces from where KutÃºzov was standing, a dense French
 15747	column coming up to meet the Ãpsherons.
 15748	
 15749	âHere it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,â
 15750	thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to KutÃºzov.
 15751	
 15752	âThe Ãpsherons must be stopped, your excellency,â cried he. But at
 15753	that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard
 15754	quite close at hand, and a voice of naÃ¯ve terror barely two steps from
 15755	Prince Andrew shouted, âBrothers! Allâs lost!â And at this as if
 15756	at a command, everyone began to run.
 15757	
 15758	Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five
 15759	minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it
 15760	have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to
 15761	be carried back with it oneself. BolkÃ³nski only tried not to lose
 15762	touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was
 15763	happening in front of him. NesvÃ­tski with an angry face, red and unlike
 15764	himself, was shouting to KutÃºzov that if he did not ride away at once
 15765	he would certainly be taken prisoner. KutÃºzov remained in the same
 15766	place and without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing
 15767	from his cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to him.
 15768	
 15769	âYou are wounded?â he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of
 15770	his lower jaw.
 15771	
 15772	âThe wound is not here, it is there!â said KutÃºzov, pressing the
 15773	handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers.
 15774	âStop them!â he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing
 15775	that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the
 15776	right.
 15777	
 15778	A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.
 15779	
 15780	The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
 15781	them it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, âGet on!
 15782	Why are you hindering us?â Another in the same place turned round and
 15783	fired in the air; a third was striking the horse KutÃºzov himself rode.
 15784	Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men,
 15785	KutÃºzov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a
 15786	sound of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd
 15787	of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near KutÃºzov, saw on the
 15788	slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing
 15789	and Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry,
 15790	neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the
 15791	fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and
 15792	approached KutÃºzov. Of KutÃºzovâs suite only four remained. They were
 15793	all pale and exchanged looks in silence.
 15794	
 15795	âStop those wretches!â gasped KutÃºzov to the regimental commander,
 15796	pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish
 15797	him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across
 15798	KutÃºzovâs suite like a flock of little birds.
 15799	
 15800	The French had attacked the battery and, seeing KutÃºzov, were firing
 15801	at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg;
 15802	several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the
 15803	flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the
 15804	muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without
 15805	orders.
 15806	
 15807	âOh! Oh! Oh!â groaned KutÃºzov despairingly and looked around....
 15808	âBolkÃ³nski!â he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness
 15809	of the feebleness of age, âBolkÃ³nski!â he whispered, pointing to
 15810	the disordered battalion and at the enemy, âwhatâs that?â
 15811	
 15812	But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of
 15813	shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to
 15814	the standard.
 15815	
 15816	âForward, lads!â he shouted in a voice piercing as a childâs.
 15817	
 15818	âHere it is!â thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and
 15819	hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him.
 15820	Several soldiers fell.
 15821	
 15822	âHurrah!â shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up
 15823	the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole
 15824	battalion would follow him.
 15825	
 15826	And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then
 15827	another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting âHurrah!â
 15828	and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag
 15829	that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrewâs hands, but he
 15830	was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,
 15831	dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our
 15832	artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned
 15833	their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry
 15834	soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns
 15835	round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces
 15836	of the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and
 15837	to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped. But
 15838	he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front
 15839	of himâat the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired
 15840	gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while
 15841	a French soldier tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the
 15842	distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who
 15843	evidently did not realize what they were doing.
 15844	
 15845	âWhat are they about?â thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them.
 15846	âWhy doesnât the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed?
 15847	Why doesnât the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the
 15848	Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him....â
 15849	
 15850	And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to
 15851	the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had
 15852	triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him,
 15853	was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It
 15854	seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head
 15855	with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of
 15856	it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had
 15857	been looking at.
 15858	
 15859	âWhatâs this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,â thought he,
 15860	and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle
 15861	of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner
 15862	had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or
 15863	saved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the
 15864	skyâthe lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray
 15865	clouds gliding slowly across it. âHow quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not
 15866	at all as I ran,â thought Prince Andrewâânot as we ran, shouting
 15867	and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened
 15868	and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds
 15869	glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that
 15870	lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All
 15871	is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing,
 15872	nothing, but that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but
 15873	quiet and peace. Thank God!...â
 15874	
 15875	
 15876	
 15877	
 15878	
 15879	CHAPTER XVII
 15880	
 15881	On our right flank commanded by BagratiÃ³n, at nine oâclock the battle
 15882	had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to DolgorÃºkovâs demand to
 15883	commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself,
 15884	Prince BagratiÃ³n proposed to DolgorÃºkov to send to inquire of the
 15885	commander in chief. BagratiÃ³n knew that as the distance between the two
 15886	flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed
 15887	(which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief
 15888	(which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before
 15889	evening.
 15890	
 15891	BagratiÃ³n cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite,
 15892	and the boyish face of RostÃ³v, breathless with excitement and hope, was
 15893	the first to catch his eye. He sent him.
 15894	
 15895	âAnd if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in
 15896	chief, your excellency?â said RostÃ³v, with his hand to his cap.
 15897	
 15898	âYou can give the message to His Majesty,â said DolgorÃºkov,
 15899	hurriedly interrupting BagratiÃ³n.
 15900	
 15901	On being relieved from picket duty RostÃ³v had managed to get a few
 15902	hoursâ sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute,
 15903	with elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in
 15904	that state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and
 15905	easy.
 15906	
 15907	All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a
 15908	general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was
 15909	orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a
 15910	message to KutÃºzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning
 15911	was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of
 15912	joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein
 15913	and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of
 15914	BagratiÃ³nâs troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were
 15915	standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by UvÃ¡rovâs
 15916	cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle;
 15917	having passed UvÃ¡rovâs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon
 15918	and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder.
 15919	
 15920	In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots
 15921	at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots,
 15922	but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before
 15923	Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
 15924	several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a
 15925	general roar.
 15926	
 15927	He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another
 15928	down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading,
 15929	and mingling with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets
 15930	visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow
 15931	lines of artillery with green caissons.
 15932	
 15933	RostÃ³v stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was
 15934	going on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand
 15935	or make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of
 15936	some sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops;
 15937	but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out.
 15938	These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him;
 15939	on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.
 15940	
 15941	âGo on! Go on! Give it them!â he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,
 15942	and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and
 15943	farther into the region where the army was already in action.
 15944	
 15945	âHow it will be there I donât know, but all will be well!â thought
 15946	RostÃ³v.
 15947	
 15948	After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the
 15949	line (the Guards) was already in action.
 15950	
 15951	âSo much the better! I shall see it close,â he thought.
 15952	
 15953	He was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came
 15954	galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered
 15955	ranks were returning from the attack. RostÃ³v got out of their way,
 15956	involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.
 15957	
 15958	âThat is no business of mine,â he thought. He had not ridden many
 15959	hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole
 15960	width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white
 15961	uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and
 15962	across his path. RostÃ³v put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
 15963	way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the
 15964	same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the
 15965	horses were already galloping. RostÃ³v heard the thud of their hoofs
 15966	and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and
 15967	even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse Guards,
 15968	advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them.
 15969	
 15970	The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.
 15971	RostÃ³v could already see their faces and heard the command:
 15972	âCharge!â shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to
 15973	full speed. RostÃ³v, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on
 15974	the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but
 15975	still was not in time to avoid them.
 15976	
 15977	The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily
 15978	on seeing RostÃ³v before him, with whom he would inevitably collide.
 15979	This Guardsman would certainly have bowled RostÃ³v and his Bedouin over
 15980	(RostÃ³v felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men
 15981	and horses) had it not occurred to RostÃ³v to flourish his whip before
 15982	the eyes of the Guardsmanâs horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen
 15983	hands high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman
 15984	drove his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail
 15985	and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse
 15986	Guards passed RostÃ³v before he heard them shout, âHurrah!â and
 15987	looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some
 15988	foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing
 15989	more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and
 15990	smoke enveloped everything.
 15991	
 15992	At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in
 15993	the smoke, RostÃ³v hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where
 15994	he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that
 15995	amazed the French themselves. RostÃ³v was horrified to hear later that
 15996	of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant,
 15997	rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their
 15998	thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.
 15999	
 16000	âWhy should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see
 16001	the Emperor immediately!â thought RostÃ³v and galloped on.
 16002	
 16003	When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and
 16004	around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so
 16005	much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on
 16006	the soldiersâ faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
 16007	officers.
 16008	
 16009	Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a
 16010	voice calling him by name.
 16011	
 16012	âRostÃ³v!â
 16013	
 16014	âWhat?â he answered, not recognizing BorÃ­s.
 16015	
 16016	âI say, weâve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!â said
 16017	BorÃ­s with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been
 16018	under fire for the first time.
 16019	
 16020	RostÃ³v stopped.
 16021	
 16022	âHave you?â he said. âWell, how did it go?â
 16023	
 16024	âWe drove them back!â said BorÃ­s with animation, growing talkative.
 16025	âCan you imagine it?â and he began describing how the Guards, having
 16026	taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were
 16027	Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged
 16028	by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had
 16029	unexpectedly to go into action. RostÃ³v without hearing BorÃ­s to the
 16030	end spurred his horse.
 16031	
 16032	âWhere are you off to?â asked BorÃ­s.
 16033	
 16034	âWith a message to His Majesty.â
 16035	
 16036	âThere he is!â said BorÃ­s, thinking RostÃ³v had said âHis
 16037	Highness,â and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders
 16038	and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet
 16039	and Horse Guardsâ jacket, shouting something to a pale, white
 16040	uniformed Austrian officer.
 16041	
 16042	âBut thatâs the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the
 16043	Emperor,â said RostÃ³v, and was about to spur his horse.
 16044	
 16045	âCount! Count!â shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager
 16046	as BorÃ­s. âCount! I am wounded in my right handâ (and he showed his
 16047	bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) âand I remained at
 16048	the front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our familyâthe
 16049	von Bergsâhave been knights!â
 16050	
 16051	He said something more, but RostÃ³v did not wait to hear it and rode
 16052	away.
 16053	
 16054	Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, RostÃ³v, to avoid
 16055	again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse
 16056	Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place
 16057	where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he
 16058	heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops,
 16059	where he could never have expected the enemy to be.
 16060	
 16061	âWhat can it be?â he thought. âThe enemy in the rear of our army?
 16062	Impossible!â And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
 16063	and for the issue of the whole battle. âBut be that what it may,â
 16064	he reflected, âthere is no riding round it now. I must look for the
 16065	commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
 16066	the rest.â
 16067	
 16068	The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over RostÃ³v was more and
 16069	more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of
 16070	Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.
 16071	
 16072	âWhat does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is
 16073	firing?â RostÃ³v kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian
 16074	soldiers running in confused crowds across his path.
 16075	
 16076	âThe devil knows! Theyâve killed everybody! Itâs all up now!â
 16077	he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who
 16078	understood what was happening as little as he did.
 16079	
 16080	âKill the Germans!â shouted one.
 16081	
 16082	âMay the devil take themâthe traitors!â
 16083	
 16084	âZum Henker diese Russen!â * muttered a German.
 16085	
 16086	    * âHang these Russians!â
 16087	
 16088	
 16089	Several wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams,
 16090	and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down.
 16091	RostÃ³v learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing
 16092	at one another.
 16093	
 16094	âMy God! What does it all mean?â thought he. âAnd here, where at
 16095	any moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a
 16096	handful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it canât be that, it
 16097	canât be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!â
 16098	
 16099	The idea of defeat and flight could not enter RostÃ³vâs head. Though
 16100	he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where
 16101	he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not,
 16102	did not wish to, believe that.
 16103	
 16104	
 16105	
 16106	
 16107	
 16108	CHAPTER XVIII
 16109	
 16110	RostÃ³v had been ordered to look for KutÃºzov and the Emperor near the
 16111	village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer
 16112	were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He
 16113	urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but
 16114	the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on
 16115	which he had come out was thronged with calÃ¨ches, carriages of all
 16116	sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and
 16117	some not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
 16118	dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries
 16119	stationed on the Pratzen Heights.
 16120	
 16121	âWhere is the Emperor? Where is KutÃºzov?â RostÃ³v kept asking
 16122	everyone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.
 16123	
 16124	At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.
 16125	
 16126	âEh, brother! Theyâve all bolted long ago!â said the soldier,
 16127	laughing for some reason and shaking himself free.
 16128	
 16129	Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, RostÃ³v stopped the
 16130	horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
 16131	question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a
 16132	carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and
 16133	that he was dangerously wounded.
 16134	
 16135	âIt canât be!â said RostÃ³v. âIt must have been someone else.â
 16136	
 16137	âI saw him myself,â replied the man with a self-confident smile of
 16138	derision. âI ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times Iâve
 16139	seen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in
 16140	the carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black horses
 16141	fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! Itâs time I knew the Imperial
 16142	horses and IlyÃ¡ IvÃ¡nych. I donât think IlyÃ¡ drives anyone except
 16143	the Tsar!â
 16144	
 16145	RostÃ³v let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded
 16146	officer passing by addressed him:
 16147	
 16148	âWho is it you want?â he asked. âThe commander in chief? He was
 16149	killed by a cannon ballâstruck in the breast before our regiment.â
 16150	
 16151	âNot killedâwounded!â another officer corrected him.
 16152	
 16153	âWho? KutÃºzov?â asked RostÃ³v.
 16154	
 16155	âNot KutÃºzov, but whatâs his nameâwell, never mind... there are
 16156	not many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders
 16157	are there,â said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek,
 16158	and he walked on.
 16159	
 16160	RostÃ³v rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now
 16161	going. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to
 16162	doubt it now. RostÃ³v rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which
 16163	he saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say
 16164	to the Tsar or to KutÃºzov, even if they were alive and unwounded?
 16165	
 16166	âTake this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!â a
 16167	soldier shouted to him. âTheyâd kill you there!â
 16168	
 16169	âOh, what are you talking about?â said another. âWhere is he to
 16170	go? That way is nearer.â
 16171	
 16172	RostÃ³v considered, and then went in the direction where they said he
 16173	would be killed.
 16174	
 16175	âItâs all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to
 16176	save myself?â he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest
 16177	number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not
 16178	yet occupied that region, and the Russiansâthe uninjured and slightly
 16179	woundedâhad left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of
 16180	manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded
 16181	to each couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes
 16182	and one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes
 16183	feignedâor so it seemed to RostÃ³v. He put his horse to a trot to
 16184	avoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraidâafraid not
 16185	for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not
 16186	stand the sight of these unfortunates.
 16187	
 16188	The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
 16189	wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant
 16190	riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The
 16191	sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
 16192	him merged in RostÃ³vâs mind into a single feeling of terror and pity
 16193	for himself. He remembered his motherâs last letter. âWhat would she
 16194	feel,â thought he, âif she saw me here now on this field with the
 16195	cannon aimed at me?â
 16196	
 16197	In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from
 16198	the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less
 16199	disordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire
 16200	sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle
 16201	was lost. No one whom RostÃ³v asked could tell him where the Emperor
 16202	or KutÃºzov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was
 16203	correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had
 16204	spread by the fact that the Emperorâs carriage had really galloped
 16205	from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal
 16206	Count TolstÃ³y, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in
 16207	the Emperorâs suite. One officer told RostÃ³v that he had seen someone
 16208	from headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither RostÃ³v
 16209	rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When
 16210	he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian
 16211	troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men
 16212	on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed
 16213	familiar to RostÃ³v; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which
 16214	RostÃ³v fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his
 16215	horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only
 16216	a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horseâs hind hoofs.
 16217	Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially
 16218	addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting
 16219	that he should do the same. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar
 16220	to RostÃ³v and involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of
 16221	refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture RostÃ³v instantly
 16222	recognized his lamented and adored monarch.
 16223	
 16224	âBut it canât be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!â
 16225	thought RostÃ³v. At that moment Alexander turned his head and RostÃ³v
 16226	saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The
 16227	Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm,
 16228	the mildness of his features, was all the greater. RostÃ³v was happy
 16229	in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were
 16230	false. He was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even
 16231	ought to go straight to him and give the message DolgorÃºkov had ordered
 16232	him to deliver.
 16233	
 16234	But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the
 16235	thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a
 16236	chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is
 16237	alone with her, so RostÃ³v, now that he had attained what he had longed
 16238	for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach
 16239	the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be
 16240	inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.
 16241	
 16242	âWhat! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of
 16243	his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or
 16244	painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him
 16245	now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight
 16246	of him?â Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor
 16247	that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall. Those
 16248	speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the
 16249	most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally
 16250	when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic
 16251	deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.
 16252	
 16253	âBesides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right
 16254	flank now that it is nearly four oâclock and the battle is lost?
 16255	No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his
 16256	reflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind
 16257	look or bad opinion from him,â RostÃ³v decided; and sorrowfully and
 16258	with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the
 16259	Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.
 16260	
 16261	While RostÃ³v was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away,
 16262	Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the
 16263	Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him
 16264	to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling
 16265	unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him.
 16266	RostÃ³v from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke
 16267	long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping,
 16268	covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Tollâs hand.
 16269	
 16270	âAnd I might have been in his place!â thought RostÃ³v, and hardly
 16271	restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter
 16272	despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.
 16273	
 16274	His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was
 16275	the cause of his grief.
 16276	
 16277	He might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It
 16278	was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not
 16279	made use of it.... âWhat have I done?â thought he. And he turned
 16280	round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but
 16281	there was no one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages
 16282	were passing by. From one of the drivers he learned that KutÃºzovâs
 16283	staff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to.
 16284	RostÃ³v followed them. In front of him walked KutÃºzovâs groom leading
 16285	horses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old,
 16286	bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.
 16287	
 16288	âTit! I say, Tit!â said the groom.
 16289	
 16290	âWhat?â answered the old man absent-mindedly.
 16291	
 16292	âGo, Tit! Thresh a bit!â
 16293	
 16294	âOh, you fool!â said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed
 16295	in silence, and then the same joke was repeated.
 16296	
 16297	
 16298	Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points. More
 16299	than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.
 16300	
 16301	PrzebyszÃ©wski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns
 16302	after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused
 16303	masses.
 16304	
 16305	The remains of Langeronâs and DokhtÃºrovâs mingled forces were
 16306	crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of
 16307	Augesd.
 16308	
 16309	After five oâclock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade
 16310	(delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous
 16311	batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our
 16312	retreating forces.
 16313	
 16314	In the rearguard, DokhtÃºrov and others rallying some battalions kept up
 16315	a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It
 16316	was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the
 16317	old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully
 16318	angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the
 16319	floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for
 16320	so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully
 16321	driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty
 16322	with flour whitening their cartsâon that narrow dam amid the wagons
 16323	and the cannon, under the horsesâ hoofs and between the wagon wheels,
 16324	men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one
 16325	another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to
 16326	move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.
 16327	
 16328	Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or
 16329	a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and
 16330	splashing with blood those near them.
 16331	
 16332	DÃ³lokhovânow an officerâwounded in the arm, and on foot, with
 16333	the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,
 16334	represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by the
 16335	crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in
 16336	on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a
 16337	cannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone
 16338	behind them, another fell in front and splashed DÃ³lokhov with blood.
 16339	The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few
 16340	steps, and again stopped.
 16341	
 16342	âMove on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here
 16343	another two minutes and it is certain death,â thought each one.
 16344	
 16345	DÃ³lokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge
 16346	of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the
 16347	slippery ice that covered the millpool.
 16348	
 16349	âTurn this way!â he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked
 16350	under him; âturn this way!â he shouted to those with the gun. âIt
 16351	bears!...â
 16352	
 16353	The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it
 16354	would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even
 16355	under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the
 16356	bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the
 16357	entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address
 16358	DÃ³lokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
 16359	everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general fell
 16360	from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of
 16361	raising him.
 16362	
 16363	âGet onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Donât you hear? Go
 16364	on!â innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck
 16365	the general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were
 16366	shouting.
 16367	
 16368	One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the
 16369	ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond.
 16370	The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped
 16371	into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist.
 16372	The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but
 16373	from behind still came the shouts: âOnto the ice, why do you stop? Go
 16374	on! Go on!â And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers
 16375	near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and
 16376	move on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under
 16377	those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on
 16378	it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.
 16379	
 16380	Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the
 16381	ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered
 16382	the dam, the pond, and the bank.
 16383	
 16384	
 16385	
 16386	
 16387	
 16388	CHAPTER XIX
 16389	
 16390	On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his
 16391	hand, lay Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski bleeding profusely and unconsciously
 16392	uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.
 16393	
 16394	Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know
 16395	how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was
 16396	alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.
 16397	
 16398	âWhere is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw
 16399	today?â was his first thought. âAnd I did not know this suffering
 16400	either,â he thought. âYes, I did not know anything, anything at all
 16401	till now. But where am I?â
 16402	
 16403	He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices
 16404	speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty
 16405	sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and
 16406	between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not
 16407	see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up
 16408	and stopped near him.
 16409	
 16410	It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding
 16411	over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
 16412	firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
 16413	on the field.
 16414	
 16415	âFine men!â remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier,
 16416	who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his
 16417	stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.
 16418	
 16419	âThe ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your
 16420	Majesty,â said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were
 16421	firing at Augesd.
 16422	
 16423	âHave some brought from the reserve,â said Napoleon, and having gone
 16424	on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with
 16425	the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already
 16426	been taken by the French as a trophy.)
 16427	
 16428	âThatâs a fine death!â said Napoleon as he gazed at BolkÃ³nski.
 16429	
 16430	Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
 16431	Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he
 16432	heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only
 16433	did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once
 16434	forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,
 16435	and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it
 16436	was Napoleonâhis heroâbut at that moment Napoleon seemed to him
 16437	such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now
 16438	between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over
 16439	it. At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over
 16440	him, or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing
 16441	near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to
 16442	life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to
 16443	understand it so differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and
 16444	utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan
 16445	which aroused his own pity.
 16446	
 16447	âAh! He is alive,â said Napoleon. âLift this young man up and
 16448	carry him to the dressing station.â
 16449	
 16450	Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in
 16451	hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.
 16452	
 16453	Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the
 16454	terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while
 16455	being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.
 16456	He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other
 16457	wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital.
 16458	During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look
 16459	about him and even speak.
 16460	
 16461	The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French
 16462	convoy officer, who said rapidly: âWe must halt here: the Emperor
 16463	will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen
 16464	prisoners.â
 16465	
 16466	âThere are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army,
 16467	that he is probably tired of them,â said another officer.
 16468	
 16469	âAll the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor
 16470	Alexanderâs Guards,â said the first one, indicating a Russian
 16471	officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.
 16472	
 16473	BolkÃ³nski recognized Prince RepnÃ­n whom he had met in Petersburg
 16474	society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of
 16475	the Horse Guards.
 16476	
 16477	Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.
 16478	
 16479	âWhich is the senior?â he asked, on seeing the prisoners.
 16480	
 16481	They named the colonel, Prince RepnÃ­n.
 16482	
 16483	âYou are the commander of the Emperor Alexanderâs regiment of Horse
 16484	Guards?â asked Napoleon.
 16485	
 16486	âI commanded a squadron,â replied RepnÃ­n.
 16487	
 16488	âYour regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,â said Napoleon.
 16489	
 16490	âThe praise of a great commander is a soldierâs highest reward,â
 16491	said RepnÃ­n.
 16492	
 16493	âI bestow it with pleasure,â said Napoleon. âAnd who is that young
 16494	man beside you?â
 16495	
 16496	Prince RepnÃ­n named Lieutenant SukhtÃ©len.
 16497	
 16498	After looking at him Napoleon smiled.
 16499	
 16500	âHeâs very young to come to meddle with us.â
 16501	
 16502	âYouth is no hindrance to courage,â muttered SukhtÃ©len in a failing
 16503	voice.
 16504	
 16505	âA splendid reply!â said Napoleon. âYoung man, you will go far!â
 16506	
 16507	Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperorâs
 16508	eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his
 16509	attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
 16510	and, addressing him, again used the epithet âyoung manâ that was
 16511	connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.
 16512	
 16513	âWell, and you, young man,â said he. âHow do you feel, mon
 16514	brave?â
 16515	
 16516	Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few
 16517	words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed
 16518	straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment
 16519	seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his
 16520	hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear,
 16521	compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and
 16522	understood, that he could not answer him.
 16523	
 16524	Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
 16525	stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,
 16526	suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into
 16527	Napoleonâs eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of
 16528	greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and
 16529	the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one
 16530	alive could understand or explain.
 16531	
 16532	The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of
 16533	the officers as he went: âHave these gentlemen attended to and taken
 16534	to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds. Au revoir,
 16535	Prince RepnÃ­n!â and he spurred his horse and galloped away.
 16536	
 16537	His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.
 16538	
 16539	The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the
 16540	little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brotherâs neck, but
 16541	seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to
 16542	return the holy image.
 16543	
 16544	Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the
 16545	little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest
 16546	outside his uniform.
 16547	
 16548	âIt would be good,â thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his
 16549	sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, âit
 16550	would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to
 16551	Mary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life,
 16552	and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I
 16553	should be if I could now say: âLord, have mercy on me!â... But to
 16554	whom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible,
 16555	which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in
 16556	wordsâthe Great All or Nothing-â said he to himself, âor to
 16557	that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing
 16558	certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I
 16559	understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but
 16560	all-important.â
 16561	
 16562	The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;
 16563	his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father,
 16564	wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night
 16565	before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and
 16566	above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious
 16567	fancies.
 16568	
 16569	The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented
 16570	itself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that
 16571	little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
 16572	shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments
 16573	had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward morning
 16574	all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of
 16575	unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleonâs doctor,
 16576	Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.
 16577	
 16578	âHe is a nervous, bilious subject,â said Larrey, âand will not
 16579	recover.â
 16580	
 16581	And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of
 16582	the inhabitants of the district.

 16594	CHAPTER I
 16595	
 16596	Early in the year 1806 Nicholas RostÃ³v returned home on leave. DenÃ­sov
 16597	was going home to VorÃ³nezh and RostÃ³v persuaded him to travel with him
 16598	as far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at
 16599	the last post station but one before Moscow, DenÃ­sov had drunk three
 16600	bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the
 16601	snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay
 16602	at the bottom of the sleigh beside RostÃ³v, who grew more and more
 16603	impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.
 16604	
 16605	âHow much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,
 16606	shops, bakersâ signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!â thought
 16607	RostÃ³v, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and
 16608	they had entered Moscow.
 16609	
 16610	âDenÃ­sov! Weâre here! Heâs asleep,â he added, leaning forward
 16611	with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed
 16612	of the sleigh.
 16613	
 16614	DenÃ­sov gave no answer.
 16615	
 16616	âThereâs the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, ZakhÃ¡r,
 16617	has his stand, and thereâs ZakhÃ¡r himself and still the same horse!
 16618	And hereâs the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Canât
 16619	you hurry up? Now then!â
 16620	
 16621	âWhich house is it?â asked the driver.
 16622	
 16623	âWhy, that one, right at the end, the big one. Donât you see?
 16624	Thatâs our house,â said RostÃ³v. âOf course, itâs our house!
 16625	DenÃ­sov, DenÃ­sov! Weâre almost there!â
 16626	
 16627	DenÃ­sov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.
 16628	
 16629	âDmÃ­tri,â said RostÃ³v to his valet on the box, âthose lights are
 16630	in our house, arenât they?â
 16631	
 16632	âYes, sir, and thereâs a light in your fatherâs study.â
 16633	
 16634	âThen theyâve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now,
 16635	donât forget to put out my new coat,â added RostÃ³v, fingering his
 16636	new mustache. âNow then, get on,â he shouted to the driver. âDo
 16637	wake up, VÃ¡ska!â he went on, turning to DenÃ­sov, whose head
 16638	was again nodding. âCome, get on! You shall have three rubles for
 16639	vodkaâget on!â RostÃ³v shouted, when the sleigh was only three
 16640	houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at
 16641	all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and
 16642	RostÃ³v saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster
 16643	broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He
 16644	sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house
 16645	stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it.
 16646	There was no one in the hall. âOh God! Is everyone all right?â
 16647	he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then
 16648	immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of
 16649	the familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always
 16650	angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely
 16651	as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.
 16652	
 16653	Old Michael was asleep on the chest. ProkÃ³fy, the footman, who was
 16654	so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat
 16655	plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening
 16656	door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one
 16657	of delighted amazement.
 16658	
 16659	âGracious heavens! The young count!â he cried, recognizing his
 16660	young master. âCan it be? My treasure!â and ProkÃ³fy, trembling with
 16661	excitement, rushed toward the drawing room door, probably in order to
 16662	announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the
 16663	young manâs shoulder.
 16664	
 16665	âAll well?â asked RostÃ³v, drawing away his arm.
 16666	
 16667	âYes, God be thanked! Yes! Theyâve just finished supper. Let me have
 16668	a look at you, your excellency.â
 16669	
 16670	âIs everything quite all right?â
 16671	
 16672	âThe Lord be thanked, yes!â
 16673	
 16674	RostÃ³v, who had completely forgotten DenÃ­sov, not wishing anyone to
 16675	forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the
 16676	large dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card
 16677	tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had
 16678	already seen the young master, and, before he had reached the drawing
 16679	room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began
 16680	hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the same
 16681	kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing,
 16682	more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was
 16683	Papa, which NatÃ¡sha, and which PÃ©tya. Everyone shouted, talked, and
 16684	kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed
 16685	that.
 16686	
 16687	âAnd I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...â
 16688	
 16689	âHere he is... our own... KÃ³lya, * dear fellow... How he has
 16690	changed!... Where are the candles?... Tea!...â
 16691	
 16692	    * Nicholas.
 16693	
 16694	âAnd me, kiss me!â
 16695	
 16696	âDearest... and me!â
 16697	
 16698	SÃ³nya, NatÃ¡sha, PÃ©tya, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, VÃ©ra, and the old count
 16699	were all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the
 16700	room, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.
 16701	
 16702	PÃ©tya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, âAnd me too!â
 16703	
 16704	NatÃ¡sha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face
 16705	with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and
 16706	pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly.
 16707	
 16708	All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around
 16709	were lips seeking a kiss.
 16710	
 16711	SÃ³nya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,
 16712	looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she
 16713	longed. SÃ³nya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at
 16714	this moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking
 16715	her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave her a
 16716	grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someone. The old
 16717	countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps
 16718	so rapid that they could hardly be his motherâs.
 16719	
 16720	Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since
 16721	he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her. When they
 16722	met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her face, but
 16723	only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussarâs jacket. DenÃ­sov,
 16724	who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped
 16725	his eyes at the sight.
 16726	
 16727	âVasÃ­li DenÃ­sov, your sonâs friend,â he said, introducing
 16728	himself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.
 16729	
 16730	âYou are most welcome! I know, I know,â said the count, kissing and
 16731	embracing DenÃ­sov. âNicholas wrote us... NatÃ¡sha, VÃ©ra, look! Here
 16732	is DenÃ­sov!â
 16733	
 16734	The same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of DenÃ­sov.
 16735	
 16736	âDarling DenÃ­sov!â screamed NatÃ¡sha, beside herself with rapture,
 16737	springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This
 16738	escapade made everybody feel confused. DenÃ­sov blushed too, but smiled
 16739	and, taking NatÃ¡shaâs hand, kissed it.
 16740	
 16741	DenÃ­sov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the RostÃ³vs all
 16742	gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.
 16743	
 16744	The old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
 16745	moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every
 16746	movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring
 16747	eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest
 16748	to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea,
 16749	handkerchief, and pipe.
 16750	
 16751	RostÃ³v was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first
 16752	moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed
 16753	insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.
 16754	
 16755	Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept
 16756	till ten oâclock.
 16757	
 16758	In the room next to their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,
 16759	satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly
 16760	cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants
 16761	were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their
 16762	well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.
 16763	
 16764	âHallo, GwÃ­skaâmy pipe!â came VasÃ­li DenÃ­sovâs husky voice.
 16765	âWostÃ³v, get up!â
 16766	
 16767	RostÃ³v, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his
 16768	disheveled head from the hot pillow.
 16769	
 16770	âWhy, is it late?â
 16771	
 16772	âLate! Itâs nearly ten oâclock,â answered NatÃ¡shaâs voice.
 16773	A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of
 16774	girlsâ voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a
 16775	crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair,
 16776	and merry faces. It was NatÃ¡sha, SÃ³nya, and PÃ©tya, who had come to
 16777	see whether they were getting up.
 16778	
 16779	âNicholas! Get up!â NatÃ¡shaâs voice was again heard at the door.
 16780	
 16781	âDirectly!â
 16782	
 16783	Meanwhile, PÃ©tya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room,
 16784	with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and
 16785	forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,
 16786	opened the bedroom door.
 16787	
 16788	âIs this your saber?â he shouted.
 16789	
 16790	The girls sprang aside. DenÃ­sov hid his hairy legs under the blanket,
 16791	looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door, having let
 16792	PÃ©tya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from behind it.
 16793	
 16794	âNicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!â said NatÃ¡shaâs voice.
 16795	
 16796	âIs this your saber?â asked PÃ©tya. âOr is it yours?â he said,
 16797	addressing the black-mustached DenÃ­sov with servile deference.
 16798	
 16799	RostÃ³v hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown,
 16800	and went out. NatÃ¡sha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting
 16801	her foot into the other. SÃ³nya, when he came in, was twirling round and
 16802	was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down. They were
 16803	dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and
 16804	bright. SÃ³nya ran away, but NatÃ¡sha, taking her brotherâs arm, led
 16805	him into the sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave
 16806	one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand
 16807	little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves. NatÃ¡sha
 16808	laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what
 16809	they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable
 16810	to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.
 16811	
 16812	âOh, how nice, how splendid!â she said to everything.
 16813	
 16814	RostÃ³v felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that
 16815	childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left
 16816	home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his
 16817	soul and his face.
 16818	
 16819	âNo, but listen,â she said, ânow you are quite a man, arenât
 16820	you? Iâm awfully glad youâre my brother.â She touched his
 16821	mustache. âI want to know what you men are like. Are you the same as
 16822	we? No?â
 16823	
 16824	âWhy did SÃ³nya run away?â asked RostÃ³v.
 16825	
 16826	âAh, yes! Thatâs a whole long story! How are you going to speak to
 16827	herâthou or you?â
 16828	
 16829	âAs may happen,â said RostÃ³v.
 16830	
 16831	âNo, call her you, please! Iâll tell you all about it some other
 16832	time. No, Iâll tell you now. You know SÃ³nyaâs my dearest friend.
 16833	Such a friend that I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!â
 16834	
 16835	She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long,
 16836	slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered
 16837	even by a ball dress.
 16838	
 16839	âI burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in the
 16840	fire and pressed it there!â
 16841	
 16842	Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what used
 16843	to be his old schoolroom, and looking into NatÃ¡shaâs wildly bright
 16844	eyes, RostÃ³v re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no
 16845	meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life;
 16846	and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem
 16847	to him senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it.
 16848	
 16849	âWell, and is that all?â he asked.
 16850	
 16851	âWe are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just
 16852	nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it
 16853	for life, but I donât understand that, I forget quickly.â
 16854	
 16855	âWell, what then?â
 16856	
 16857	âWell, she loves me and you like that.â
 16858	
 16859	NatÃ¡sha suddenly flushed.
 16860	
 16861	âWhy, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are to
 16862	forget all that.... She says: âI shall love him always, but let him be
 16863	free.â Isnât that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isnât it?â
 16864	asked NatÃ¡sha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what
 16865	she was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.
 16866	
 16867	RostÃ³v became thoughtful.
 16868	
 16869	âI never go back on my word,â he said. âBesides, SÃ³nya is so
 16870	charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness.â
 16871	
 16872	âNo, no!â cried NatÃ¡sha, âshe and I have already talked it over.
 16873	We knew youâd say so. But it wonât do, because you see, if you say
 16874	thatâif you consider yourself bound by your promiseâit will seem as
 16875	if she had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying
 16876	her because you must, and that wouldnât do at all.â
 16877	
 16878	RostÃ³v saw that it had been well considered by them. SÃ³nya had already
 16879	struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when he had caught
 16880	a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl
 16881	of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt
 16882	that for an instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry
 16883	her, RostÃ³v thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures
 16884	and interests before him! âYes, they have taken a wise decision,â he
 16885	thought, âI must remain free.â
 16886	
 16887	âWell then, thatâs excellent,â said he. âWeâll talk it over
 16888	later on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!â
 16889	
 16890	âWell, and are you still true to BorÃ­s?â he continued.
 16891	
 16892	âOh, what nonsense!â cried NatÃ¡sha, laughing. âI donât think
 16893	about him or anyone else, and I donât want anything of the kind.â
 16894	
 16895	âDear me! Then what are you up to now?â
 16896	
 16897	âNow?â repeated NatÃ¡sha, and a happy smile lit up her face. âHave
 16898	you seen Duport?â
 16899	
 16900	âNo.â
 16901	
 16902	âNot seen Duportâthe famous dancer? Well then, you wonât
 16903	understand. Thatâs what Iâm up to.â
 16904	
 16905	Curving her arms, NatÃ¡sha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran back
 16906	a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply
 16907	together, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.
 16908	
 16909	âSee, Iâm standing! See!â she said, but could not maintain herself
 16910	on her toes any longer. âSo thatâs what Iâm up to! Iâll never
 16911	marry anyone, but will be a dancer. Only donât tell anyone.â
 16912	
 16913	RostÃ³v laughed so loud and merrily that DenÃ­sov, in his bedroom, felt
 16914	envious and NatÃ¡sha could not help joining in.
 16915	
 16916	âNo, but donât you think itâs nice?â she kept repeating.
 16917	
 16918	âNice! And so you no longer wish to marry BorÃ­s?â
 16919	
 16920	NatÃ¡sha flared up. âI donât want to marry anyone. And Iâll tell
 16921	him so when I see him!â
 16922	
 16923	âDear me!â said RostÃ³v.
 16924	
 16925	âBut thatâs all rubbish,â NatÃ¡sha chattered on. âAnd is
 16926	DenÃ­sov nice?â she asked.
 16927	
 16928	âYes, indeed!â
 16929	
 16930	âOh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible,
 16931	DenÃ­sov?â
 16932	
 16933	âWhy terrible?â asked Nicholas. âNo, VÃ¡ska is a splendid
 16934	fellow.â
 16935	
 16936	âYou call him VÃ¡ska? Thatâs funny! And is he very nice?â
 16937	
 16938	âVery.â
 16939	
 16940	âWell then, be quick. Weâll all have breakfast together.â
 16941	
 16942	And NatÃ¡sha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet
 16943	dancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When
 16944	RostÃ³v met SÃ³nya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know
 16945	how to behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of
 16946	meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not
 16947	be done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was
 16948	looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave
 16949	with her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as
 16950	youâSÃ³nya. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender
 16951	kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared, by
 16952	NatÃ¡shaâs intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then
 16953	thanked him for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his
 16954	freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to
 16955	love her, for that would be impossible.
 16956	
 16957	âHow strange it is,â said VÃ©ra, selecting a moment when all were
 16958	silent, âthat SÃ³nya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet
 16959	like strangers.â
 16960	
 16961	VÃ©raâs remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like
 16962	most of her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not
 16963	only SÃ³nya, Nicholas, and NatÃ¡sha, but even the old countess,
 16964	whoâdreading this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making
 16965	a brilliant matchâblushed like a girl.
 16966	
 16967	DenÃ­sov, to RostÃ³vâs surprise, appeared in the drawing room with
 16968	pomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as
 16969	he made himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the
 16970	ladies and gentlemen than RostÃ³v had ever expected to see him.
 16971	
 16972	
 16973	
 16974	
 16975	
 16976	CHAPTER II
 16977	
 16978	On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas RostÃ³v was welcomed
 16979	by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling
 16980	NikÃ³lenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young
 16981	man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good
 16982	dancer, and one of the best matches in the city.
 16983	
 16984	The RostÃ³vs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough
 16985	that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,
 16986	acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the
 16987	latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the
 16988	latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,
 16989	passed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself
 16990	to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be
 16991	at home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much. His
 16992	despair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money from
 16993	GavrÃ­l to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing SÃ³nya on the slyâhe now
 16994	recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind.
 16995	Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and
 16996	wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in
 16997	action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected racing
 16998	men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady on one
 16999	of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka
 17000	at the ArkhÃ¡rovsâ ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal
 17001	KÃ¡menski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a
 17002	colonel of forty to whom DenÃ­sov had introduced him.
 17003	
 17004	His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But still, as
 17005	he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke
 17006	about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he
 17007	had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the
 17008	Emperor not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared
 17009	the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of
 17010	as the âangel incarnate.â
 17011	
 17012	During RostÃ³vâs short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he
 17013	did not draw closer to SÃ³nya, but rather drifted away from her. She was
 17014	very pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was
 17015	at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no
 17016	time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and
 17017	prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things. When he
 17018	thought of SÃ³nya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself,
 17019	âAh, there will be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom
 17020	I do not yet know. There will be time enough to think about love when I
 17021	want to, but now I have no time.â Besides, it seemed to him that the
 17022	society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood. He went to balls
 17023	and into ladiesâ society with an affectation of doing so against his
 17024	will. The races, the English Club, sprees with DenÃ­sov, and visits to
 17025	a certain houseâthat was another matter and quite the thing for a
 17026	dashing young hussar!
 17027	
 17028	At the beginning of March, old Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v was very busy
 17029	arranging a dinner in honor of Prince BagratiÃ³n at the English Club.
 17030	
 17031	The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving
 17032	orders to the club steward and to the famous FeoktÃ­st, the clubâs
 17033	head cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and
 17034	fish for this dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee
 17035	of the club from the day it was founded. To him the club entrusted the
 17036	arrangement of the festival in honor of BagratiÃ³n, for few men knew
 17037	so well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale,
 17038	and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
 17039	their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete.
 17040	The club cook and the steward listened to the countâs orders with
 17041	pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could they
 17042	so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing
 17043	several thousand rubles.
 17044	
 17045	âWell then, mind and have cocksâ comb in the turtle soup, you
 17046	know!â
 17047	
 17048	âShall we have three cold dishes then?â asked the cook.
 17049	
 17050	The count considered.
 17051	
 17052	âWe canât have lessâyes, three... the mayonnaise, thatâs one,â
 17053	said he, bending down a finger.
 17054	
 17055	âThen am I to order those large sterlets?â asked the steward.
 17056	
 17057	âYes, it canât be helped if they wonât take less. Ah, dear me! I
 17058	was forgetting. We must have another entrÃ©e. Ah, goodness gracious!â
 17059	he clutched at his head. âWho is going to get me the flowers? DmÃ­tri!
 17060	Eh, DmÃ­tri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate,â he said to the factotum
 17061	who appeared at his call. âHurry off and tell MaksÃ­m, the gardener,
 17062	to set the serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must
 17063	be brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred pots
 17064	here on Friday.â
 17065	
 17066	Having given several more orders, he was about to go to his âlittle
 17067	countessâ to have a rest, but remembering something else of
 17068	importance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club
 17069	steward, and again began giving orders. A light footstep and the
 17070	clinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young count, handsome,
 17071	rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently rested and made sleeker by
 17072	his easy life in Moscow, entered the room.
 17073	
 17074	âAh, my boy, my headâs in a whirl!â said the old man with a smile,
 17075	as if he felt a little confused before his son. âNow, if you would
 17076	only help a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own orchestra,
 17077	but shouldnât we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like
 17078	that sort of thing.â
 17079	
 17080	âReally, Papa, I believe Prince BagratiÃ³n worried himself less before
 17081	the battle of SchÃ¶n Grabern than you do now,â said his son with a
 17082	smile.
 17083	
 17084	The old count pretended to be angry.
 17085	
 17086	âYes, you talk, but try it yourself!â
 17087	
 17088	And the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful
 17089	expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
 17090	son.
 17091	
 17092	âWhat have the young people come to nowadays, eh, FeoktÃ­st?â said
 17093	he. âLaughing at us old fellows!â
 17094	
 17095	âThatâs so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good
 17096	dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, thatâs not their
 17097	business!â
 17098	
 17099	âThatâs it, thatâs it!â exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing
 17100	his son by both hands, he cried, âNow Iâve got you, so take the
 17101	sleigh and pair at once, and go to BezÃºkhovâs, and tell him âCount
 17102	IlyÃ¡ has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples.â We
 17103	canât get them from anyone else. Heâs not there himself, so youâll
 17104	have to go in and ask the princesses; and from there go on to the
 17105	RasgulyÃ¡yâthe coachman IpÃ¡tka knowsâand look up the gypsy
 17106	IlyÃºshka, the one who danced at Count OrlÃ³vâs, you remember, in a
 17107	white Cossack coat, and bring him along to me.â
 17108	
 17109	âAnd am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?â asked Nicholas,
 17110	laughing. âDear, dear!...â
 17111	
 17112	At that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike,
 17113	preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna
 17114	MikhÃ¡ylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his
 17115	dressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to
 17116	excuse his costume.
 17117	
 17118	âNo matter at all, my dear count,â she said, meekly closing her
 17119	eyes. âBut Iâll go to BezÃºkhovâs myself. Pierre has arrived, and
 17120	now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him
 17121	in any case. He has forwarded me a letter from BorÃ­s. Thank God, BorÃ­s
 17122	is now on the staff.â
 17123	
 17124	The count was delighted at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs taking upon herself one
 17125	of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.
 17126	
 17127	âTell BezÃºkhov to come. Iâll put his name down. Is his wife with
 17128	him?â he asked.
 17129	
 17130	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted
 17131	on her face.
 17132	
 17133	âAh, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,â she said. âIf what
 17134	we hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing
 17135	when we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul
 17136	as young BezÃºkhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give
 17137	him what consolation I can.â
 17138	
 17139	âWh-what is the matter?â asked both the young and old RostÃ³v.
 17140	
 17141	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna sighed deeply.
 17142	
 17143	âDÃ³lokhov, Mary IvÃ¡novnaâs son,â she said in a mysterious
 17144	whisper, âhas compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him
 17145	up, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here
 17146	and that daredevil after her!â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, wishing to show
 17147	her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile
 17148	betraying her sympathy for the âdaredevil,â as she called DÃ³lokhov.
 17149	âThey say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune.â
 17150	
 17151	âDear, dear! But still tell him to come to the clubâit will all blow
 17152	over. It will be a tremendous banquet.â
 17153	
 17154	Next day, the third of March, soon after one oâclock, two hundred and
 17155	fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the
 17156	guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince BagratiÃ³n, to
 17157	dinner.
 17158	
 17159	On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had
 17160	been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories
 17161	that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it,
 17162	while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an
 17163	event. In the English Club, where all who were distinguished, important,
 17164	and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in
 17165	December, nothing was said about the war and the last battle, as
 17166	though all were in a conspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone
 17167	in conversationâCount RostopchÃ­n, Prince YÃºri DolgorÃºkov, ValÃºev,
 17168	Count MarkÃ³v, and Prince VyÃ¡zemskiâdid not show themselves at the
 17169	club, but met in private houses in intimate circles, and the
 17170	Moscovites who took their opinions from othersâIlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v among
 17171	themâremained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject
 17172	of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was
 17173	wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best
 17174	to be silent. But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room,
 17175	the bigwigs who guided the clubâs opinion reappeared, and everybody
 17176	began speaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for the
 17177	incredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat,
 17178	everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things
 17179	began to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a
 17180	defective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole PrzebyszÃ©wski and of
 17181	the Frenchman Langeron, KutÃºzovâs incapacity, and (it was whispered)
 17182	the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless
 17183	and insignificant people. But the army, the Russian army, everyone
 17184	declared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor. The
 17185	soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was
 17186	Prince BagratiÃ³n, distinguished by his SchÃ¶n Grabern affair and by
 17187	the retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column
 17188	unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous
 17189	as his own. What also conduced to BagratiÃ³nâs being selected as
 17190	Moscowâs hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city
 17191	and was a stranger there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple
 17192	fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one
 17193	who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of
 17194	SuvÃ³rov. Moreover, paying such honor to BagratiÃ³n was the best way of
 17195	expressing disapproval and dislike of KutÃºzov.
 17196	
 17197	âHad there been no BagratiÃ³n, it would have been necessary to
 17198	invent him,â said the wit ShinshÃ­n, parodying the words of Voltaire.
 17199	KutÃºzov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers,
 17200	calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.
 17201	
 17202	All Moscow repeated Prince DolgorÃºkovâs saying: âIf you go on
 17203	modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay,â suggesting
 17204	consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the
 17205	words of RostopchÃ­n, that French soldiers have to be incited to battle
 17206	by highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to show them
 17207	that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but that Russian
 17208	soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all sides, new and
 17209	fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by
 17210	our officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another
 17211	had killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded.
 17212	Berg was mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when
 17213	wounded in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone
 17214	forward. Of BolkÃ³nski, nothing was said, and only those who knew him
 17215	intimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pregnant wife
 17216	with his eccentric father.
 17217	
 17218	
 17219	
 17220	
 17221	
 17222	CHAPTER III
 17223	
 17224	On that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were filled
 17225	with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in springtime.
 17226	The members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat,
 17227	stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress,
 17228	and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftÃ¡ns.
 17229	Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings,
 17230	stood at every door anxiously noting visitorsâ every movement in order
 17231	to offer their services. Most of those present were elderly, respected
 17232	men with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures
 17233	and voices. This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
 17234	places and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present
 17235	were casual guestsâchiefly young men, among whom were DenÃ­sov,
 17236	RostÃ³v, and DÃ³lokhovâwho was now again an officer in the SemÃ«nov
 17237	regiment. The faces of these young people, especially those who were
 17238	military men, bore that expression of condescending respect for their
 17239	elders which seems to say to the older generation, âWe are prepared to
 17240	respect and honor you, but all the same remember that the future belongs
 17241	to us.â
 17242	
 17243	NesvÃ­tski was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who at his
 17244	wifeâs command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles,
 17245	went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here,
 17246	as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to
 17247	his wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he
 17248	treated them with absent-minded contempt.
 17249	
 17250	By his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his wealth
 17251	and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests, and
 17252	so he went from one group to another. Some of the most important old men
 17253	were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully
 17254	to hear the voices of well-known men. The largest circles formed round
 17255	Count RostopchÃ­n, ValÃºev, and NarÃ½shkin. RostopchÃ­n was describing
 17256	how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to
 17257	force their way through them with bayonets.
 17258	
 17259	ValÃºev was confidentially telling that UvÃ¡rov had been sent from
 17260	Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.
 17261	
 17262	In the third circle, NarÃ½shkin was speaking of the meeting of the
 17263	Austrian Council of War at which SuvÃ³rov crowed like a cock in reply to
 17264	the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. ShinshÃ­n, standing close
 17265	by, tried to make a joke, saying that KutÃºzov had evidently failed to
 17266	learn from SuvÃ³rov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
 17267	cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him
 17268	feel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of
 17269	KutÃºzov.
 17270	
 17271	Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft
 17272	boots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the
 17273	important and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all
 17274	equals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up
 17275	young son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young RostÃ³v
 17276	stood at a window with DÃ³lokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately
 17277	made and highly valued. The old count came up to them and pressed
 17278	DÃ³lokhovâs hand.
 17279	
 17280	âPlease come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been together
 17281	out there... both playing the hero... Ah, VasÃ­li IgnÃ¡tovich...
 17282	How dâye do, old fellow?â he said, turning to an old man who was
 17283	passing, but before he had finished his greeting there was a general
 17284	stir, and a footman who had run in announced, with a frightened face:
 17285	âHeâs arrived!â
 17286	
 17287	Bells rang, the stewards rushed forward, andâlike rye shaken together
 17288	in a shovelâthe guests who had been scattered about in different rooms
 17289	came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the
 17290	ballroom.
 17291	
 17292	BagratiÃ³n appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword,
 17293	which, in accord with the club custom, he had given up to the hall
 17294	porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip
 17295	over his shoulder, as when RostÃ³v had seen him on the eve of the battle
 17296	of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign
 17297	Orders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast. Evidently just
 17298	before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed,
 17299	which changed his appearance for the worse. There was something naÃ¯vely
 17300	festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile
 17301	features, gave him a rather comical expression. BekleshÃ«v and Theodore
 17302	UvÃ¡rov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him,
 17303	as the guest of honor, to enter first. BagratiÃ³n was embarrassed, not
 17304	wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay
 17305	at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly
 17306	and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing
 17307	what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed
 17308	field under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at
 17309	SchÃ¶n Grabernâand he would have found that easier. The committeemen
 17310	met him at the first door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a
 17311	highly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting
 17312	for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was
 17313	at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of
 17314	members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look
 17315	at BagratiÃ³n over each otherâs shoulders, as if he were some rare
 17316	animal. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, laughing and repeating the words, âMake
 17317	way, dear boy! Make way, make way!â pushed through the crowd more
 17318	energetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and
 17319	seated them on the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members
 17320	of the club, beset the new arrivals. Count IlyÃ¡, again thrusting his
 17321	way through the crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a
 17322	minute later with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver
 17323	which he presented to Prince BagratiÃ³n. On the salver lay some verses
 17324	composed and printed in the heroâs honor. BagratiÃ³n, on seeing the
 17325	salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes
 17326	demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in their power, he
 17327	resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and
 17328	reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him. Someone
 17329	obligingly took the dish from BagratiÃ³n (or he would, it seemed, have
 17330	held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his
 17331	attention to the verses.
 17332	
 17333	âWell, I will read them, then!â BagratiÃ³n seemed to say, and,
 17334	fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and
 17335	serious expression. But the author himself took the verses and began
 17336	reading them aloud. BagratiÃ³n bowed his head and listened:
 17337	
 17338	   Bring glory then to Alexanderâs reign
 17339	   And on the throne our Titus shield.
 17340	   A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,
 17341	   A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!
 17342	   Eâen fortunate Napoleon
 17343	   Knows by experience, now, BagratiÃ³n,
 17344	   And dare not Herculean Russians trouble...
 17345	
 17346	But before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced
 17347	that dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room came
 17348	the resounding strains of the polonaise:
 17349	
 17350	   Conquestâs joyful thunder waken,
 17351	   Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...
 17352	
 17353	and Count RostÃ³v, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading
 17354	his verses, bowed to BagratiÃ³n. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner
 17355	was more important than verses, and BagratiÃ³n, again preceding all the
 17356	rest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between
 17357	two AlexandersâBekleshÃ«v and NarÃ½shkinâwhich was a significant
 17358	allusion to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took their
 17359	seats in the dining room, according to their rank and importance: the
 17360	more important nearer to the honored guest, as naturally as water flows
 17361	deepest where the land lies lowest.
 17362	
 17363	Just before dinner, Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v presented his son to BagratiÃ³n,
 17364	who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward,
 17365	as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count IlyÃ¡ looked joyfully
 17366	and proudly around while BagratiÃ³n spoke to his son.
 17367	
 17368	Nicholas RostÃ³v, with DenÃ­sov and his new acquaintance, DÃ³lokhov, sat
 17369	almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince
 17370	NesvÃ­tski. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v with the other members of the committee
 17371	sat facing BagratiÃ³n and, as the very personification of Moscow
 17372	hospitality, did the honors to the prince.
 17373	
 17374	His efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the
 17375	other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the
 17376	end of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the
 17377	footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything
 17378	was excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of
 17379	which IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v blushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen
 17380	began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses. After the fish,
 17381	which made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with
 17382	the other committeemen. âThere will be many toasts, itâs time to
 17383	begin,â he whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. All were
 17384	silent, waiting for what he would say.
 17385	
 17386	âTo the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!â he cried, and at the
 17387	same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm.
 17388	The band immediately struck up âConquestâs joyful thunder
 17389	waken...â All rose and cried âHurrah!â BagratiÃ³n also rose and
 17390	shouted âHurrah!â in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted
 17391	it on the field at SchÃ¶n Grabern. Young RostÃ³vâs ecstatic voice
 17392	could be heard above the three hundred others. He nearly wept. âTo the
 17393	health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!â he roared, âHurrah!â and
 17394	emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many followed
 17395	his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time. When the
 17396	voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody
 17397	sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging
 17398	remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside
 17399	his plate, and proposed a toast, âTo the health of the hero of our
 17400	last campaign, Prince Peter IvÃ¡novich BagratiÃ³n!â and again his blue
 17401	eyes grew moist. âHurrah!â cried the three hundred voices again,
 17402	but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul
 17403	IvÃ¡novich KutÃºzov:
 17404	
 17405	   Russians! Oâer all barriers on!
 17406	   Courage conquest guarantees;
 17407	   Have we not BagratiÃ³n?
 17408	   He brings foemen to their knees,... etc.
 17409	
 17410	As soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed
 17411	and Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v became more and more moved, more glass was
 17412	smashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank to BekleshÃ«v,
 17413	NarÃ½shkin, UvÃ¡rov, DolgorÃºkov, AprÃ¡ksin, ValÃºev, to the committee,
 17414	to all the club members and to all the club guests, and finally to
 17415	Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v separately, as the organizer of the banquet. At that
 17416	toast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept
 17417	outright.
 17418	
 17419	
 17420	
 17421	
 17422	
 17423	CHAPTER IV
 17424	
 17425	Pierre sat opposite DÃ³lokhov and Nicholas RostÃ³v. As usual, he ate and
 17426	drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed that
 17427	some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through
 17428	dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and
 17429	a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his
 17430	nose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear
 17431	nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some
 17432	depressing and unsolved problem.
 17433	
 17434	The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the
 17435	princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning DÃ³lokhovâs intimacy with
 17436	his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which
 17437	in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw
 17438	badly through his spectacles, but that his wifeâs connection with
 17439	DÃ³lokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely
 17440	disbelieved both the princessâ hints and the letter, but he feared
 17441	now to look at DÃ³lokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every time
 17442	he chanced to meet DÃ³lokhovâs handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt
 17443	something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly
 17444	away. Involuntarily recalling his wifeâs past and her relations with
 17445	DÃ³lokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be
 17446	true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife.
 17447	He involuntarily remembered how DÃ³lokhov, who had fully recovered his
 17448	former position after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come
 17449	to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon
 17450	companion, DÃ³lokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put
 17451	him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how HÃ©lÃ¨ne had smilingly
 17452	expressed disapproval of DÃ³lokhovâs living at their house, and how
 17453	cynically DÃ³lokhov had praised his wifeâs beauty to him and from that
 17454	time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day.
 17455	
 17456	âYes, he is very handsome,â thought Pierre, âand I know him. It
 17457	would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule
 17458	me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him,
 17459	and helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the
 17460	pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true,
 17461	but I do not believe it. I have no right to, and canât, believe it.â
 17462	He remembered the expression DÃ³lokhovâs face assumed in his moments
 17463	of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them
 17464	into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any
 17465	reason, or shot a post-boyâs horse with a pistol. That expression
 17466	was often on DÃ³lokhovâs face when looking at him. âYes, he is a
 17467	bully,â thought Pierre, âto kill a man means nothing to him. It must
 17468	seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him.
 17469	He must think that I, too, am afraid of himâand in fact I am afraid of
 17470	him,â he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous
 17471	rising in his soul. DÃ³lokhov, DenÃ­sov, and RostÃ³v were now sitting
 17472	opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. RostÃ³v was talking merrily to his
 17473	two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious
 17474	duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at
 17475	Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very
 17476	noticeable one at the dinner. RostÃ³v looked inimically at Pierre,
 17477	first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the
 17478	husband of a beauty, and in a wordâan old woman; and secondly because
 17479	Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized
 17480	RostÃ³v and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperorâs
 17481	health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his
 17482	glass.
 17483	
 17484	âWhat are you about?â shouted RostÃ³v, looking at him in an ecstasy
 17485	of exasperation. âDonât you hear itâs His Majesty the Emperorâs
 17486	health?â
 17487	
 17488	Pierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till
 17489	all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to RostÃ³v.
 17490	
 17491	âWhy, I didnât recognize you!â he said. But RostÃ³v was otherwise
 17492	engaged; he was shouting âHurrah!â
 17493	
 17494	âWhy donât you renew the acquaintance?â said DÃ³lokhov to RostÃ³v.
 17495	
 17496	âConfound him, heâs a fool!â said RostÃ³v.
 17497	
 17498	âOne should make up to the husbands of pretty women,â said DenÃ­sov.
 17499	
 17500	Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking
 17501	about him. He reddened and turned away.
 17502	
 17503	âWell, now to the health of handsome women!â said DÃ³lokhov, and
 17504	with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of
 17505	his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.
 17506	
 17507	âHereâs to the health of lovely women, Peterkinâand their
 17508	lovers!â he added.
 17509	
 17510	Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at
 17511	DÃ³lokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets
 17512	with KutÃºzovâs cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the
 17513	principal guests. He was just going to take it when DÃ³lokhov, leaning
 17514	across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked
 17515	at DÃ³lokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and monstrous
 17516	that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him.
 17517	He leaned his whole massive body across the table.
 17518	
 17519	âHow dare you take it?â he shouted.
 17520	
 17521	Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, NesvÃ­tski and the
 17522	neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to BezÃºkhov.
 17523	
 17524	âDonât! Donât! What are you about?â whispered their frightened
 17525	voices.
 17526	
 17527	DÃ³lokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that
 17528	smile of his which seemed to say, âAh! This is what I like!â
 17529	
 17530	âYou shanât have it!â he said distinctly.
 17531	
 17532	Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.
 17533	
 17534	âYou...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!â he ejaculated, and,
 17535	pushing back his chair, he rose from the table.
 17536	
 17537	At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt
 17538	that the question of his wifeâs guilt which had been tormenting him
 17539	the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative.
 17540	He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite DenÃ­sovâs
 17541	request that he would take no part in the matter, RostÃ³v agreed to be
 17542	DÃ³lokhovâs second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for
 17543	the duel with NesvÃ­tski, BezÃºkhovâs second. Pierre went home, but
 17544	RostÃ³v with DÃ³lokhov and DenÃ­sov stayed on at the club till late,
 17545	listening to the gypsies and other singers.
 17546	
 17547	âWell then, till tomorrow at SokÃ³lniki,â said DÃ³lokhov, as he took
 17548	leave of RostÃ³v in the club porch.
 17549	
 17550	âAnd do you feel quite calm?â RostÃ³v asked.
 17551	
 17552	DÃ³lokhov paused.
 17553	
 17554	âWell, you see, Iâll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two
 17555	words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write
 17556	affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be
 17557	killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm
 17558	intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and
 17559	then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at KostromÃ¡ used to tell
 17560	me. âEveryone fears a bear,â he says, âbut when you see one your
 17561	fearâs all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!â
 17562	And thatâs how it is with me. Ã demain, mon cher.â *
 17563	
 17564	    * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.
 17565	
 17566	Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and NesvÃ­tski drove to the
 17567	SokÃ³lniki forest and found DÃ³lokhov, DenÃ­sov, and RostÃ³v already
 17568	there. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which
 17569	had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow.
 17570	He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and
 17571	screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed
 17572	by two considerations: his wifeâs guilt, of which after his sleepless
 17573	night he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of
 17574	DÃ³lokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was
 17575	nothing to him.... âI should perhaps have done the same thing in his
 17576	place,â thought Pierre. âItâs even certain that I should have done
 17577	the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or
 17578	he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Canât I go away from
 17579	here, run away, bury myself somewhere?â passed through his mind. But
 17580	just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a
 17581	particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of
 17582	the onlookers, âWill it be long? Are things ready?â
 17583	
 17584	When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,
 17585	and the pistols loaded, NesvÃ­tski went up to Pierre.
 17586	
 17587	âI should not be doing my duty, Count,â he said in timid tones,
 17588	âand should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done
 17589	me in choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very
 17590	grave, moment I did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no
 17591	sufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it....
 17592	You were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous...â
 17593	
 17594	âOh yes, it is horribly stupid,â said Pierre.
 17595	
 17596	âThen allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent
 17597	will accept them,â said NesvÃ­tski (who like the others concerned in
 17598	the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that
 17599	the affair had come to an actual duel). âYou know, Count, it is much
 17600	more honorable to admit oneâs mistake than to let matters become
 17601	irreparable. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to
 17602	convey....â
 17603	
 17604	âNo! What is there to talk about?â said Pierre. âItâs all the
 17605	same.... Is everything ready?â he added. âOnly tell me where to go
 17606	and where to shoot,â he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.
 17607	
 17608	He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the
 17609	trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his handâa fact that he
 17610	did not wish to confess.
 17611	
 17612	âOh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,â said he.
 17613	
 17614	âNo apologies, none whatever,â said DÃ³lokhov to DenÃ­sov (who on
 17615	his side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to
 17616	the appointed place.
 17617	
 17618	The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,
 17619	where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest
 17620	covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the
 17621	last few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther
 17622	edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in
 17623	the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and
 17624	NesvÃ­tskiâs and DÃ³lokhovâs sabers, which were stuck into the
 17625	ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at
 17626	forty pacesâ distance nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had
 17627	been ready, but they still delayed and all were silent.
 17628	
 17629	
 17630	
 17631	
 17632	
 17633	CHAPTER V
 17634	
 17635	âWell, begin!â said DÃ³lokhov.
 17636	
 17637	âAll right,â said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling
 17638	of dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun
 17639	could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of
 17640	menâs will.
 17641	
 17642	DenÃ­sov first went to the barrier and announced: âAs the
 17643	adveâsawies have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your
 17644	pistols, and at the word thwee begin to advance.
 17645	
 17646	âO-ne! T-wo! Thwee!â he shouted angrily and stepped aside.
 17647	
 17648	The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to
 17649	one another, beginning to see one another through the mist. They had the
 17650	right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. DÃ³lokhov
 17651	walked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his
 17652	bright, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonistâs face. His mouth wore
 17653	its usual semblance of a smile.
 17654	
 17655	âSo I can fire when I like!â said Pierre, and at the word
 17656	âthree,â he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and
 17657	stepping into the deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at
 17658	armâs length, apparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left
 17659	hand he held carefully back, because he wished to support his right
 17660	hand with it and knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and
 17661	strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet,
 17662	then quickly glanced at DÃ³lokhov and, bending his finger as he had been
 17663	shown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered
 17664	at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The
 17665	smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything
 17666	for an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected. He
 17667	only heard DÃ³lokhovâs hurried steps, and his figure came in view
 17668	through the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his left side, while
 17669	the other clutched his drooping pistol. His face was pale. RostÃ³v ran
 17670	toward him and said something.
 17671	
 17672	âNo-o-o!â muttered DÃ³lokhov through his teeth, âno, itâs not
 17673	over.â And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the
 17674	saber, he sank on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped
 17675	it on his coat and supported himself with it. His frowning face was
 17676	pallid and quivered.
 17677	
 17678	âPlea...â began DÃ³lokhov, but could not at first pronounce the
 17679	word.
 17680	
 17681	âPlease,â he uttered with an effort.
 17682	
 17683	Pierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward DÃ³lokhov and
 17684	was about to cross the space between the barriers, when DÃ³lokhov cried:
 17685	
 17686	âTo your barrier!â and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by
 17687	his saber. Only ten paces divided them. DÃ³lokhov lowered his head to
 17688	the snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself,
 17689	drew in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked
 17690	and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still
 17691	smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his
 17692	remaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.
 17693	
 17694	âSideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!â ejaculated NesvÃ­tski.
 17695	
 17696	âCover yourself!â even DenÃ­sov cried to his adversary.
 17697	
 17698	Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs
 17699	helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing
 17700	DÃ³lokhov and looked sorrowfully at him. DenÃ­sov, RostÃ³v, and
 17701	NesvÃ­tski closed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a report
 17702	and DÃ³lokhovâs angry cry.
 17703	
 17704	âMissed!â shouted DÃ³lokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards
 17705	on the snow.
 17706	
 17707	Pierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,
 17708	trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:
 17709	
 17710	âFolly... folly! Death... lies...â he repeated, puckering his face.
 17711	
 17712	NesvÃ­tski stopped him and took him home.
 17713	
 17714	RostÃ³v and DenÃ­sov drove away with the wounded DÃ³lokhov.
 17715	
 17716	The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer
 17717	a word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering Moscow he
 17718	suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took RostÃ³v, who
 17719	was sitting beside him, by the hand. RostÃ³v was struck by the
 17720	totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on
 17721	DÃ³lokhovâs face.
 17722	
 17723	âWell? How do you feel?â he asked.
 17724	
 17725	âBad! But itâs not that, my friendââ said DÃ³lokhov with a
 17726	gasping voice. âWhere are we? In Moscow, I know. I donât matter,
 17727	but I have killed her, killed... She wonât get over it! She wonât
 17728	survive....â
 17729	
 17730	âWho?â asked RostÃ³v.
 17731	
 17732	âMy mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,â and
 17733	DÃ³lokhov pressed RostÃ³vâs hand and burst into tears.
 17734	
 17735	When he had become a little quieter, he explained to RostÃ³v that he was
 17736	living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it.
 17737	He implored RostÃ³v to go on and prepare her.
 17738	
 17739	RostÃ³v went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise
 17740	learned that DÃ³lokhov the brawler, DÃ³lokhov the bully, lived in Moscow
 17741	with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate
 17742	of sons and brothers.
 17743	
 17744	
 17745	
 17746	
 17747	
 17748	CHAPTER VI
 17749	
 17750	Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in
 17751	Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the
 17752	duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his
 17753	fatherâs room, that huge room in which Count BezÃºkhov had died.
 17754	
 17755	He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that
 17756	had happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings,
 17757	thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall
 17758	asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the
 17759	room with rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of
 17760	their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on
 17761	her face, and then immediately he saw beside her DÃ³lokhovâs handsome,
 17762	insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and
 17763	then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when
 17764	he reeled and sank on the snow.
 17765	
 17766	âWhat has happened?â he asked himself. âI have killed her lover,
 17767	yes, killed my wifeâs lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come
 17768	to do it?âââBecause you married her,â answered an inner voice.
 17769	
 17770	âBut in what was I to blame?â he asked. âIn marrying her without
 17771	loving her; in deceiving yourself and her.â And he vividly recalled
 17772	that moment after supper at Prince VasÃ­liâs, when he spoke those
 17773	words he had found so difficult to utter: âI love you.â âIt all
 17774	comes from that! Even then I felt it,â he thought. âI felt then that
 17775	it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.â
 17776	
 17777	He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.
 17778	Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of
 17779	how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his
 17780	study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head
 17781	steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at
 17782	his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful
 17783	understanding of his employerâs happiness.
 17784	
 17785	âBut how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty
 17786	and social tact,â thought he; âbeen proud of my house, in which she
 17787	received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty. So
 17788	this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand
 17789	her. How often when considering her character I have told myself that
 17790	I was to blame for not understanding her, for not understanding that
 17791	constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires,
 17792	and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved
 17793	woman. Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become
 17794	clear.
 17795	
 17796	âAnatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
 17797	naked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be
 17798	kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied
 17799	with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: âLet
 17800	him do what he pleases,â she used to say of me. One day I asked her if
 17801	she felt any symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said
 17802	she was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going
 17803	to have any children by me.â
 17804	
 17805	Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the
 17806	vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had
 17807	been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.
 17808	
 17809	âIâm not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous
 17810	promener,â * she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with
 17811	young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not
 17812	love her.
 17813	
 17814	    * âYou clear out of this.â
 17815	
 17816	
 17817	âYes, I never loved her,â said he to himself; âI knew she was a
 17818	depraved woman,â he repeated, âbut dared not admit it to myself.
 17819	And now thereâs DÃ³lokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and
 17820	perhaps dying, while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!â
 17821	
 17822	Pierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what
 17823	is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. He
 17824	digested his sufferings alone.
 17825	
 17826	âIt is all, all her fault,â he said to himself; âbut what of that?
 17827	Why did I bind myself to her? Why did I say âJe vous aimeâ * to her,
 17828	which was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure...
 17829	what? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, thatâs
 17830	nonsense,â he thought. âThe slur on my name and honorâthatâs all
 17831	apart from myself.â
 17832	
 17833	    * I love you.
 17834	
 17835	âLouis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
 17836	criminal,â came into Pierreâs head, âand from their point of
 17837	view they were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a
 17838	martyrâs death for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being
 17839	a despot. Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are
 17840	aliveâlive: tomorrow youâll die as I might have died an hour ago.
 17841	And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life
 17842	in comparison with eternity?â
 17843	
 17844	But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections,
 17845	she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had
 17846	most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the
 17847	blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break
 17848	and tear whatever came to his hand. âWhy did I tell her that âJe
 17849	vous aimeâ?â he kept repeating to himself. And when he had said it
 17850	for the tenth time, MoliÃ¨reâs words: âMais que diable allait-il
 17851	faire dans cette galÃ¨re?â * occurred to him, and he began to laugh at
 17852	himself.
 17853	
 17854	      * âBut what the devil was he doing in that galley?â
 17855	
 17856	
 17857	In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
 17858	Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He
 17859	resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
 17860	intention to part from her forever.
 17861	
 17862	Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre
 17863	was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.
 17864	
 17865	He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression,
 17866	unable to realize where he was.
 17867	
 17868	âThe countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at
 17869	home,â said the valet.
 17870	
 17871	But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess
 17872	herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with
 17873	simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like
 17874	a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was
 17875	a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow. With her
 17876	imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet.
 17877	She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. She waited till the
 17878	valet had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked
 17879	at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds
 17880	who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her
 17881	enemies, he tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless
 17882	and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down
 17883	but looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to
 17884	go.
 17885	
 17886	âWell, whatâs this now? What have you been up to now, I should like
 17887	to know?â she asked sternly.
 17888	
 17889	âI? What have I...?â stammered Pierre.
 17890	
 17891	âSo it seems youâre a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about?
 17892	What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.â
 17893	
 17894	Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but
 17895	could not reply.
 17896	
 17897	âIf you wonât answer, Iâll tell you...â HÃ©lÃ¨ne went on. âYou
 17898	believe everything youâre told. You were told...â HÃ©lÃ¨ne laughed,
 17899	âthat DÃ³lokhov was my lover,â she said in French with her coarse
 17900	plainness of speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other
 17901	word, âand you believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this
 17902	duel prove? That youâre a fool, que vous Ãªtes un sot, but everybody
 17903	knew that. What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of
 17904	all Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what
 17905	you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause.â
 17906	HÃ©lÃ¨ne raised her voice and became more and more excited, âA man
 17907	whoâs a better man than you in every way...â
 17908	
 17909	âHm... Hm...!â growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and
 17910	not moving a muscle.
 17911	
 17912	âAnd how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like
 17913	his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer
 17914	yours.â
 17915	
 17916	âDonât speak to me... I beg you,â muttered Pierre hoarsely.
 17917	
 17918	âWhy shouldnât I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you
 17919	plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who
 17920	would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,â
 17921	said she.
 17922	
 17923	Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange
 17924	expression she did not understand, and lay down again. He was suffering
 17925	physically at that moment, there was a weight on his chest and he could
 17926	not breathe. He knew that he must do something to put an end to this
 17927	suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.
 17928	
 17929	âWe had better separate,â he muttered in a broken voice.
 17930	
 17931	âSeparate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,â said
 17932	HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âSeparate! Thatâs a thing to frighten me with!â
 17933	
 17934	Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.
 17935	
 17936	âIâll kill you!â he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table
 17937	with a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her
 17938	brandishing the slab.
 17939	
 17940	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His
 17941	fatherâs nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and
 17942	delight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping
 17943	down on her with outstretched hands shouted, âGet out!â in such a
 17944	terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. God knows what
 17945	he would have done at that moment had HÃ©lÃ¨ne not fled from the room.
 17946	
 17947	
 17948	A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates
 17949	in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left
 17950	for Petersburg alone.
 17951	
 17952	
 17953	
 17954	
 17955	
 17956	CHAPTER VII
 17957	
 17958	Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and
 17959	the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the
 17960	letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had
 17961	not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of
 17962	all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of
 17963	his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the
 17964	place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among
 17965	strangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which
 17966	the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual
 17967	very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians
 17968	had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The
 17969	old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
 17970	defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz
 17971	came a letter from KutÃºzov informing the prince of the fate that had
 17972	befallen his son.
 17973	
 17974	âYour son,â wrote KutÃºzov, âfell before my eyes, a standard in
 17975	his hand and at the head of a regimentâhe fell as a hero, worthy of
 17976	his father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the
 17977	whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort
 17978	myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise
 17979	he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of
 17980	battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.â
 17981	
 17982	After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his
 17983	study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he
 17984	was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though
 17985	he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.
 17986	
 17987	When Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his
 17988	lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.
 17989	
 17990	âAh, Princess Mary!â he said suddenly in an unnatural voice,
 17991	throwing down his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own
 17992	impetus, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that
 17993	wheel, which merged in her memory with what followed.)
 17994	
 17995	She approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her. Her
 17996	eyes grew dim. By the expression of her fatherâs face, not sad, not
 17997	crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over
 17998	her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst
 17999	in life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and
 18000	incomprehensibleâthe death of one she loved.
 18001	
 18002	âFather! Andrew!ââsaid the ungraceful, awkward princess with such
 18003	an indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father
 18004	could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.
 18005	
 18006	âBad news! Heâs not among the prisoners nor among the killed!
 18007	KutÃºzov writes...â and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to
 18008	drive the princess away by that scream... âKilled!â
 18009	
 18010	The princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but on
 18011	hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her
 18012	beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joyâa supreme joy apart from the
 18013	joys and sorrows of this worldâoverflowed the great grief within her.
 18014	She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and
 18015	drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.
 18016	
 18017	âFather,â she said, âdo not turn away from me, let us weep
 18018	together.â
 18019	
 18020	âScoundrels! Blackguards!â shrieked the old man, turning his face
 18021	away from her. âDestroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go,
 18022	go and tell Lise.â
 18023	
 18024	The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and
 18025	wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took
 18026	leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender
 18027	and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. âDid he believe?
 18028	Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms
 18029	of eternal peace and blessedness?â she thought.
 18030	
 18031	âFather, tell me how it happened,â she asked through her tears.
 18032	
 18033	âGo! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and
 18034	Russiaâs glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell
 18035	Lise. I will follow.â
 18036	
 18037	When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat
 18038	working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm
 18039	peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see
 18040	Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something
 18041	joyful and mysterious taking place within her.
 18042	
 18043	âMary,â she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying
 18044	back, âgive me your hand.â She took her sister-in-lawâs hand and
 18045	held it below her waist.
 18046	
 18047	Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained
 18048	lifted in childlike happiness.
 18049	
 18050	Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her
 18051	sister-in-lawâs dress.
 18052	
 18053	âThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know,
 18054	Mary, I am going to love him very much,â said Lise, looking with
 18055	bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law.
 18056	
 18057	Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.
 18058	
 18059	âWhat is the matter, Mary?â
 18060	
 18061	âNothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,â she said, wiping
 18062	away her tears on her sister-in-lawâs knee.
 18063	
 18064	Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to
 18065	prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as
 18066	was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not
 18067	understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as
 18068	if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was
 18069	always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign
 18070	expression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at
 18071	Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of
 18072	attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women,
 18073	and suddenly began to cry.
 18074	
 18075	âHas anything come from Andrew?â she asked.
 18076	
 18077	âNo, you know itâs too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I
 18078	feel afraid.â
 18079	
 18080	âSo thereâs nothing?â
 18081	
 18082	âNothing,â answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant
 18083	eyes at her sister-in-law.
 18084	
 18085	She had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the
 18086	terrible news from her till after her confinement, which was expected
 18087	within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid
 18088	their grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope:
 18089	he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he
 18090	sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a
 18091	monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his
 18092	memory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed. He tried not
 18093	to change his former way of life, but his strength failed him. He walked
 18094	less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary
 18095	hoped. She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news
 18096	of his return.
 18097

 18102	CHAPTER VIII
 18103	
 18104	âDearest,â said the little princess after breakfast on the morning
 18105	of the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit,
 18106	but as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and
 18107	even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so
 18108	now the smile of the little princessâinfluenced by the general mood
 18109	though without knowing its causeâwas such as to remind one still more
 18110	of the general sorrow.
 18111	
 18112	âDearest, Iâm afraid this morningâs fruschtique *âas FÃ³ka the
 18113	cook calls itâhas disagreed with me.â
 18114	
 18115	    * FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck: breakfast.
 18116	
 18117	âWhat is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. Oh, you
 18118	are very pale!â said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft,
 18119	ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.
 18120	
 18121	âYour excellency, should not Mary BogdÃ¡novna be sent for?â said one
 18122	of the maids who was present. (Mary BogdÃ¡novna was a midwife from the
 18123	neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.)
 18124	
 18125	âOh yes,â assented Princess Mary, âperhaps thatâs it. Iâll go.
 18126	Courage, my angel.â She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.
 18127	
 18128	âOh, no, no!â And besides the pallor and the physical suffering
 18129	on the little princessâ face, an expression of childish fear of
 18130	inevitable pain showed itself.
 18131	
 18132	âNo, itâs only indigestion?... Say itâs only indigestion, say so,
 18133	Mary! Say...â And the little princess began to cry capriciously like
 18134	a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
 18135	affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary
 18136	BogdÃ¡novna.
 18137	
 18138	âMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!â she heard as she left the room.
 18139	
 18140	The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump
 18141	white hands with an air of calm importance.
 18142	
 18143	âMary BogdÃ¡novna, I think itâs beginning!â said Princess Mary
 18144	looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.
 18145	
 18146	âWell, the Lord be thanked, Princess,â said Mary BogdÃ¡novna, not
 18147	hastening her steps. âYou young ladies should not know anything about
 18148	it.â
 18149	
 18150	âBut how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?â said the
 18151	princess. (In accordance with Liseâs and Prince Andrewâs wishes they
 18152	had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at
 18153	any moment.)
 18154	
 18155	âNo matter, Princess, donât be alarmed,â said Mary BogdÃ¡novna.
 18156	âWeâll manage very well without a doctor.â
 18157	
 18158	Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy
 18159	being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the
 18160	large leather sofa from Prince Andrewâs study into the bedroom. On
 18161	their faces was a quiet and solemn look.
 18162	
 18163	Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
 18164	house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching
 18165	what was going on in the passage. Some women passing with quiet steps in
 18166	and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away. She did
 18167	not venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting
 18168	down in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before
 18169	the icon stand. To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers
 18170	did not calm her excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old
 18171	nurse, PraskÃ³vya SÃ¡vishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the
 18172	old prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl
 18173	round her head.
 18174	
 18175	âIâve come to sit with you a bit, MÃ¡sha,â said the nurse, âand
 18176	here Iâve brought the princeâs wedding candles to light before his
 18177	saint, my angel,â she said with a sigh.
 18178	
 18179	âOh, nurse, Iâm so glad!â
 18180	
 18181	âGod is merciful, birdie.â
 18182	
 18183	The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door
 18184	with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began reading. Only
 18185	when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another, the
 18186	princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging. Everyone in the
 18187	house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced
 18188	as she sat in her room. But owing to the superstition that the fewer
 18189	the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone
 18190	tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the
 18191	ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princeâs
 18192	household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a
 18193	consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished
 18194	at that moment made itself felt.
 18195	
 18196	There was no laughter in the maidsâ large hall. In the men servantsâ
 18197	hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfsâ
 18198	quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old
 18199	prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent
 18200	TÃ­khon to ask Mary BogdÃ¡novna what news.ââSay only that âthe
 18201	prince told me to ask,â and come and tell me her answer.â
 18202	
 18203	âInform the prince that labor has begun,â said Mary BogdÃ¡novna,
 18204	giving the messenger a significant look.
 18205	
 18206	TÃ­khon went and told the prince.
 18207	
 18208	âVery good!â said the prince closing the door behind him, and
 18209	TÃ­khon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.
 18210	
 18211	After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing
 18212	the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed
 18213	face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the
 18214	shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he
 18215	had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course.
 18216	Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of
 18217	heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased.
 18218	No one slept.
 18219	
 18220	It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its
 18221	sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay
 18222	of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from
 18223	Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns
 18224	were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its
 18225	hollows and snow-covered pools of water.
 18226	
 18227	Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her
 18228	luminous eyes fixed on her nurseâs wrinkled face (every line of which
 18229	she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the
 18230	kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.
 18231	
 18232	Nurse SÃ¡vishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely
 18233	hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of
 18234	times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary
 18235	in KishenÃ«v with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a
 18236	midwife.
 18237	
 18238	âGod is merciful, doctors are never needed,â she said.
 18239	
 18240	Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the
 18241	window, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the
 18242	prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks
 18243	returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask
 18244	curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft.
 18245	Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was
 18246	knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open
 18247	casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose
 18248	locks of gray hair.
 18249	
 18250	âPrincess, my dear, thereâs someone driving up the avenue!â she
 18251	said, holding the casement and not closing it. âWith lanterns. Most
 18252	likely the doctor.â
 18253	
 18254	âOh, my God! thank God!â said Princess Mary. âI must go and meet
 18255	him, he does not know Russian.â
 18256	
 18257	Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer.
 18258	As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage
 18259	with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On
 18260	a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On
 18261	the landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding
 18262	another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one
 18263	could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that
 18264	seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.
 18265	
 18266	âThank God!â said the voice. âAnd Father?â
 18267	
 18268	âGone to bed,â replied the voice of DemyÃ¡n the house steward, who
 18269	was downstairs.
 18270	
 18271	Then the voice said something more, DemyÃ¡n replied, and the steps in
 18272	the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.
 18273	
 18274	âItâs Andrew!â thought Princess Mary. âNo it canât be, that
 18275	would be too extraordinary,â and at the very moment she thought this,
 18276	the face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of
 18277	which covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman
 18278	stood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and
 18279	strangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up the
 18280	stairs and embraced his sister.
 18281	
 18282	âYou did not get my letter?â he asked, and not waiting for a
 18283	replyâwhich he would not have received, for the princess was unable to
 18284	speakâhe turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the
 18285	doctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post
 18286	station), and again embraced his sister.
 18287	
 18288	âWhat a strange fate, MÃ¡sha darling!â And having taken off his
 18289	cloak and felt boots, he went to the little princessâ apartment.
 18290	
 18291	
 18292	
 18293	
 18294	
 18295	CHAPTER IX
 18296	
 18297	The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her
 18298	head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round
 18299	her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its
 18300	downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered
 18301	and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying.
 18302	Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested
 18303	on him without changing their expression. âI love you all and have
 18304	done no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!â her look
 18305	seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance
 18306	of his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and
 18307	kissed her forehead.
 18308	
 18309	âMy darling!â he saidâa word he had never used to her before.
 18310	âGod is merciful....â
 18311	
 18312	She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.
 18313	
 18314	âI expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!â
 18315	said her eyes. She was not surprised at his having come; she did
 18316	not realize that he had come. His coming had nothing to do with
 18317	her sufferings or with their relief. The pangs began again and Mary
 18318	BogdÃ¡novna advised Prince Andrew to leave the room.
 18319	
 18320	The doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary,
 18321	again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke
 18322	off at every moment. They waited and listened.
 18323	
 18324	âGo, dear,â said Princess Mary.
 18325	
 18326	Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next
 18327	to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
 18328	confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands
 18329	and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came
 18330	through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to
 18331	open it. Someone was holding it shut.
 18332	
 18333	âYou canât come in! You canât!â said a terrified voice from
 18334	within.
 18335	
 18336	He began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds
 18337	went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriekâit could not be hers, she
 18338	could not scream like thatâcame from the bedroom. Prince Andrew ran to
 18339	the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.
 18340	
 18341	âWhat have they taken a baby in there for?â thought Prince Andrew in
 18342	the first second. âA baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or
 18343	is the baby born?â
 18344	
 18345	Then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail; tears
 18346	choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill he began to cry,
 18347	sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his shirt sleeves
 18348	tucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling jaw, came out
 18349	of the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor gave him a
 18350	bewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman rushed out and
 18351	seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold. He went into
 18352	his wifeâs room. She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen
 18353	her in five minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of
 18354	the cheeks, the same expression was on her charming childlike face with
 18355	its upper lip covered with tiny black hair.
 18356	
 18357	âI love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have you
 18358	done to me?ââsaid her charming, pathetic, dead face.
 18359	
 18360	In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed
 18361	in Mary BogdÃ¡novnaâs trembling white hands.
 18362	
 18363	
 18364	Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his fatherâs
 18365	room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to
 18366	the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise
 18367	round his sonâs neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.
 18368	
 18369	
 18370	Three days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went
 18371	up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss.
 18372	And there in the coffin was the same face, though with closed eyes.
 18373	âAh, what have you done to me?â it still seemed to say, and Prince
 18374	Andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty
 18375	of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The
 18376	old man too came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly
 18377	crossed one on the other on her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed
 18378	to say: âAh, what have you done to me, and why?â And at the sight
 18379	the old man turned angrily away.
 18380	
 18381	
 18382	Another five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas AndrÃ©evich
 18383	was baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin, while
 18384	the priest with a goose feather anointed the boyâs little red and
 18385	wrinkled soles and palms.
 18386	
 18387	His grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping
 18388	him, carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over
 18389	to the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew sat in another room,
 18390	faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font, and awaited
 18391	the termination of the ceremony. He looked up joyfully at the baby when
 18392	the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that
 18393	the wax with the babyâs hair had not sunk in the font but had floated.

 18399	CHAPTER X
 18400	
 18401	RostÃ³vâs share in DÃ³lokhovâs duel with BezÃºkhov was hushed up by
 18402	the efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks
 18403	as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
 18404	Moscow. As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the
 18405	family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties. DÃ³lokhov
 18406	recovered, and RostÃ³v became very friendly with him during his
 18407	convalescence. DÃ³lokhov lay ill at his motherâs who loved him
 18408	passionately and tenderly, and old Mary IvÃ¡novna, who had grown fond of
 18409	RostÃ³v for his friendship to her FÃ©dya, often talked to him about her
 18410	son.
 18411	
 18412	âYes, Count,â she would say, âhe is too noble and pure-souled for
 18413	our present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like
 18414	a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it
 18415	honorable, of BezÃºkhov? And FÃ©dya, with his noble spirit, loved him
 18416	and even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg
 18417	when they played some tricks on a policeman, didnât they do it
 18418	together? And there! BezÃºkhov got off scotfree, while FÃ©dya had to
 18419	bear the whole burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through!
 18420	Itâs true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that?
 18421	I think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out
 18422	there as he. And nowâthis duel! Have these people no feeling, or
 18423	honor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so
 18424	straight! Itâs well God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who
 18425	doesnât have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see
 18426	things he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months.
 18427	And then to call him out, reckoning on FÃ©dya not fighting because he
 18428	owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand
 18429	FÃ©dya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few
 18430	people do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!â
 18431	
 18432	DÃ³lokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to RostÃ³v in a way no
 18433	one would have expected of him.
 18434	
 18435	âI know people consider me a bad man!â he said. âLet them! I
 18436	donât care a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love,
 18437	I love so that I would give my life for them, and the others Iâd
 18438	throttle if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother,
 18439	and two or three friendsâyou among themâand as for the rest I only
 18440	care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of
 18441	them are harmful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy,â he continued,
 18442	âI have met loving, noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met
 18443	any womenâcountesses or cooksâwho were not venal. I have not yet met
 18444	that divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such a
 18445	one Iâd give my life for her! But those!...â and he made a gesture
 18446	of contempt. âAnd believe me, if I still value my life it is
 18447	only because I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will
 18448	regenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you donât understand it.â
 18449	
 18450	âOh, yes, I quite understand,â answered RostÃ³v, who was under his
 18451	new friendâs influence.
 18452	
 18453	In the autumn the RostÃ³vs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter
 18454	DenÃ­sov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the
 18455	winter of 1806, which Nicholas RostÃ³v spent in Moscow, was one of the
 18456	happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas brought
 18457	many young men to his parentsâ house. VÃ©ra was a handsome girl
 18458	of twenty; SÃ³nya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening
 18459	flower; NatÃ¡sha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly
 18460	amusing, now girlishly enchanting.
 18461	
 18462	At that time in the RostÃ³vsâ house there prevailed an amorous
 18463	atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very
 18464	charming girls. Every young man who came to the houseâseeing those
 18465	impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own
 18466	happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful
 18467	bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
 18468	young girls ready for anything and full of hopeâexperienced the same
 18469	feeling; sharing with the young folk of the RostÃ³vsâ household a
 18470	readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.
 18471	
 18472	Among the young men introduced by RostÃ³v one of the first was
 18473	DÃ³lokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except NatÃ¡sha. She almost
 18474	quarreled with her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad
 18475	man, and that in the duel with BezÃºkhov, Pierre was right and DÃ³lokhov
 18476	wrong, and further that he was disagreeable and unnatural.
 18477	
 18478	âThereâs nothing for me to understand,â she cried out with
 18479	resolute self-will, âhe is wicked and heartless. There now, I like
 18480	your DenÃ­sov though he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so
 18481	you see I do understand. I donât know how to put it... with this one
 18482	everything is calculated, and I donât like that. But DenÃ­sov...â
 18483	
 18484	âOh, DenÃ­sov is quite different,â replied Nicholas, implying that
 18485	even DenÃ­sov was nothing compared to DÃ³lokhovââyou must understand
 18486	what a soul there is in DÃ³lokhov, you should see him with his mother.
 18487	What a heart!â
 18488	
 18489	âWell, I donât know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And
 18490	do you know he has fallen in love with SÃ³nya?â
 18491	
 18492	âWhat nonsense...â
 18493	
 18494	âIâm certain of it; youâll see.â
 18495	
 18496	NatÃ¡shaâs prediction proved true. DÃ³lokhov, who did not usually care
 18497	for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the
 18498	question for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon
 18499	settled. He came because of SÃ³nya. And SÃ³nya, though she would never
 18500	have dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time DÃ³lokhov
 18501	appeared.
 18502	
 18503	DÃ³lokhov often dined at the RostÃ³vsâ, never missed a performance at
 18504	which they were present, and went to Iogelâs balls for young people
 18505	which the RostÃ³vs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to SÃ³nya
 18506	and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
 18507	glances without coloring, but even the old countess and NatÃ¡sha blushed
 18508	when they saw his looks.
 18509	
 18510	It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible
 18511	influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.
 18512	
 18513	RostÃ³v noticed something new in DÃ³lokhovâs relations with SÃ³nya,
 18514	but he did not explain to himself what these new relations were.
 18515	âTheyâre always in love with someone,â he thought of SÃ³nya and
 18516	NatÃ¡sha. But he was not as much at ease with SÃ³nya and DÃ³lokhov as
 18517	before and was less frequently at home.
 18518	
 18519	In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with
 18520	Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders were
 18521	given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the regular army,
 18522	and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. Everywhere
 18523	Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war
 18524	was talked of. For the RostÃ³v family the whole interest of these
 18525	preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of
 18526	remaining in Moscow, and only awaited the termination of DenÃ­sovâs
 18527	furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment. His
 18528	approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather
 18529	gave zest to his pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away
 18530	from home, at dinners, parties, and balls.
 18531	
 18532	
 18533	
 18534	
 18535	
 18536	CHAPTER XI
 18537	
 18538	On the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing he had
 18539	rarely done of late. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and DenÃ­sov
 18540	were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people
 18541	were present, including DÃ³lokhov and DenÃ­sov.
 18542	
 18543	Never had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous
 18544	atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the RostÃ³vsâ house as at
 18545	this holiday time. âSeize the moments of happiness, love and be loved!
 18546	That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one
 18547	thing we are interested in here,â said the spirit of the place.
 18548	
 18549	Nicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without
 18550	visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited,
 18551	returned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and
 18552	felt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a
 18553	curious embarrassment among some of those present. SÃ³nya, DÃ³lokhov,
 18554	and the old countess were especially disturbed, and to a lesser degree
 18555	NatÃ¡sha. Nicholas understood that something must have happened between
 18556	SÃ³nya and DÃ³lokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitiveness
 18557	natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On
 18558	that same evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel (the
 18559	dancing master) gave for his pupils during the holidays.
 18560	
 18561	âNicholas, will you come to Iogelâs? Please do!â said NatÃ¡sha.
 18562	âHe asked you, and VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich * is also going.â
 18563	
 18564	    * DenÃ­sov.
 18565	
 18566	âWhere would I not go at the countessâ command!â said DenÃ­sov,
 18567	who at the RostÃ³vsâ had jocularly assumed the role of NatÃ¡shaâs
 18568	knight. âIâm even weady to dance the pas de chÃ¢le.â
 18569	
 18570	âIf I have time,â answered Nicholas. âBut I promised the
 18571	ArkhÃ¡rovs; they have a party.â
 18572	
 18573	âAnd you?â he asked DÃ³lokhov, but as soon as he had asked the
 18574	question he noticed that it should not have been put.
 18575	
 18576	âPerhaps,â coldly and angrily replied DÃ³lokhov, glancing at SÃ³nya,
 18577	and, scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre
 18578	at the club dinner.
 18579	
 18580	âThere is something up,â thought Nicholas, and he was further
 18581	confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that DÃ³lokhov left immediately
 18582	after dinner. He called NatÃ¡sha and asked her what was the matter.
 18583	
 18584	âAnd I was looking for you,â said NatÃ¡sha running out to him. âI
 18585	told you, but you would not believe it,â she said triumphantly. âHe
 18586	has proposed to SÃ³nya!â
 18587	
 18588	Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with SÃ³nya of late, something
 18589	seemed to give way within him at this news. DÃ³lokhov was a suitable and
 18590	in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From
 18591	the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the
 18592	question for her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholasâ first feeling
 18593	on hearing the news was one of anger with SÃ³nya.... He tried to say,
 18594	âThatâs capital; of course sheâll forget her childish promises
 18595	and accept the offer,â but before he had time to say it NatÃ¡sha began
 18596	again.
 18597	
 18598	âAnd fancy! she refused him quite definitely!â adding, after a
 18599	pause, âshe told him she loved another.â
 18600	
 18601	âYes, my SÃ³nya could not have done otherwise!â thought Nicholas.
 18602	
 18603	âMuch as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she wonât change
 18604	once she has said...â
 18605	
 18606	âAnd Mamma pressed her!â said Nicholas reproachfully.
 18607	
 18608	âYes,â said NatÃ¡sha. âDo you know, Nicholasâdonât be
 18609	angryâbut I know you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but
 18610	I know for certain that you wonât marry her.â
 18611	
 18612	âNow you donât know that at all!â said Nicholas. âBut I must
 18613	talk to her. What a darling SÃ³nya is!â he added with a smile.
 18614	
 18615	âAh, she is indeed a darling! Iâll send her to you.â
 18616	
 18617	And NatÃ¡sha kissed her brother and ran away.
 18618	
 18619	A minute later SÃ³nya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared
 18620	look. Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the first
 18621	time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love.
 18622	
 18623	âSophie,â he began, timidly at first and then more and more
 18624	boldly, âif you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and
 18625	advantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend...â
 18626	
 18627	SÃ³nya interrupted him.
 18628	
 18629	âI have already refused,â she said hurriedly.
 18630	
 18631	âIf you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I...â
 18632	
 18633	SÃ³nya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.
 18634	
 18635	âNicholas, donât tell me that!â she said.
 18636	
 18637	âNo, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say
 18638	it. If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I
 18639	love you, and I think I love you more than anyone else....â
 18640	
 18641	âThat is enough for me,â said SÃ³nya, blushing.
 18642	
 18643	âNo, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in
 18644	love again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship,
 18645	confidence, and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does
 18646	not wish it. In a word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider
 18647	DÃ³lokhovâs offer,â he said, articulating his friendâs name with
 18648	difficulty.
 18649	
 18650	âDonât say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and
 18651	always shall, and I want nothing more.â
 18652	
 18653	âYou are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of
 18654	misleading you.â
 18655	
 18656	And Nicholas again kissed her hand.
 18657	
 18658	
 18659	
 18660	
 18661	
 18662	CHAPTER XII
 18663	
 18664	Iogelâs were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers
 18665	as they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps,
 18666	and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they
 18667	were ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and women who
 18668	came to these balls with an air of condescension and found them most
 18669	enjoyable. That year two marriages had come of these balls. The two
 18670	pretty young Princesses GorchakÃ³v met suitors there and were married
 18671	and so further increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished
 18672	them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of
 18673	the good-natured Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according
 18674	to the rules of his art, as he collected the tickets from all his
 18675	visitors. There was the fact that only those came who wished to dance
 18676	and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are
 18677	wearing long dresses for the first time. With scarcely any exceptions
 18678	they all were, or seemed to be, prettyâso rapturous were their smiles
 18679	and so sparkling their eyes. Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom
 18680	NatÃ¡sha, who was exceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas
 18681	de chÃ¢le, but at this last ball only the Ã©cossaise, the anglaise, and
 18682	the mazurka, which was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had
 18683	taken a ballroom in BezÃºkhovâs house, and the ball, as everyone said,
 18684	was a great success. There were many pretty girls and the RostÃ³v girls
 18685	were among the prettiest. They were both particularly happy and gay.
 18686	That evening, proud of DÃ³lokhovâs proposal, her refusal, and her
 18687	explanation with Nicholas, SÃ³nya twirled about before she left home
 18688	so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she was
 18689	transparently radiant with impulsive joy.
 18690	
 18691	NatÃ¡sha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
 18692	ball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with pink
 18693	ribbons.
 18694	
 18695	NatÃ¡sha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She
 18696	was not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever
 18697	person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.
 18698	
 18699	âOh, how delightful it is!â she kept saying, running up to SÃ³nya.
 18700	
 18701	Nicholas and DenÃ­sov were walking up and down, looking with kindly
 18702	patronage at the dancers.
 18703	
 18704	âHow sweet she isâshe will be a weal beauty!â said DenÃ­sov.
 18705	
 18706	âWho?â
 18707	
 18708	âCountess NatÃ¡sha,â answered DenÃ­sov.
 18709	
 18710	âAnd how she dances! What gwace!â he said again after a pause.
 18711	
 18712	âWho are you talking about?â
 18713	
 18714	âAbout your sister,â ejaculated DenÃ­sov testily.
 18715	
 18716	RostÃ³v smiled.
 18717	
 18718	âMy dear count, you were one of my best pupilsâyou must dance,â
 18719	said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. âLook how many charming young
 18720	ladiesââ He turned with the same request to DenÃ­sov who was also a
 18721	former pupil of his.
 18722	
 18723	âNo, my dear fellow, Iâll be a wallflower,â said DenÃ­sov.
 18724	âDonât you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?â
 18725	
 18726	âOh no!â said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. âYou were only
 18727	inattentive, but you had talentâoh yes, you had talent!â
 18728	
 18729	The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not
 18730	refuse Iogel and asked SÃ³nya to dance. DenÃ­sov sat down by the old
 18731	ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told
 18732	them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young
 18733	people dancing, Iogel with NatÃ¡sha, his pride and his best pupil, were
 18734	the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little
 18735	feet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with NatÃ¡sha, who,
 18736	though shy, went on carefully executing her steps. DenÃ­sov did not
 18737	take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly
 18738	indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not
 18739	because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to RostÃ³v
 18740	who was passing:
 18741	
 18742	âThis is not at all the thing,â he said. âWhat sort of Polish
 18743	mazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly.â
 18744	
 18745	Knowing that DenÃ­sov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly
 18746	way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to NatÃ¡sha:
 18747	
 18748	âGo and choose DenÃ­sov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!â he said.
 18749	
 18750	When it came to NatÃ¡shaâs turn to choose a partner, she rose and,
 18751	tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran
 18752	timidly to the corner where DenÃ­sov sat. She saw that everybody was
 18753	looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that DenÃ­sov was refusing
 18754	though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.
 18755	
 18756	âPlease, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich,â NatÃ¡sha was saying, âdo come!â
 18757	
 18758	âOh no, let me off, Countess,â DenÃ­sov replied.
 18759	
 18760	âNow then, VÃ¡ska,â said Nicholas.
 18761	
 18762	âThey coax me as if I were VÃ¡ska the cat!â said DenÃ­sov jokingly.
 18763	
 18764	âIâll sing for you a whole evening,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 18765	
 18766	âOh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!â said DenÃ­sov, and
 18767	he unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his
 18768	partnerâs hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,
 18769	waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was
 18770	DenÃ­sovâs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow
 18771	he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways
 18772	at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with
 18773	one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room
 18774	taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across
 18775	the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at
 18776	them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs,
 18777	he stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot
 18778	clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel
 18779	against his right, flew round again in a circle. NatÃ¡sha guessed what
 18780	he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly
 18781	knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now
 18782	with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him,
 18783	and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if
 18784	he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath,
 18785	and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected
 18786	steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her
 18787	chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, NatÃ¡sha
 18788	did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement,
 18789	smiling as if she did not recognize him.
 18790	
 18791	âWhat does this mean?â she brought out.
 18792	
 18793	Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone
 18794	was delighted with DenÃ­sovâs skill, he was asked again and again as
 18795	a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the
 18796	good old days. DenÃ­sov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself
 18797	with his handkerchief, sat down by NatÃ¡sha and did not leave her for
 18798	the rest of the evening.
 18799	
 18800	
 18801	
 18802	
 18803	
 18804	CHAPTER XIII
 18805	
 18806	For two days after that RostÃ³v did not see DÃ³lokhov at his own or at
 18807	DÃ³lokhovâs home: on the third day he received a note from him:
 18808	
 18809	As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know
 18810	of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper
 18811	tonight to my friendsâcome to the English Hotel.
 18812	
 18813	About ten oâclock RostÃ³v went to the English Hotel straight from the
 18814	theater, where he had been with his family and DenÃ­sov. He was at once
 18815	shown to the best room, which DÃ³lokhov had taken for that evening. Some
 18816	twenty men were gathered round a table at which DÃ³lokhov sat between
 18817	two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he
 18818	was keeping the bank. RostÃ³v had not seen him since his proposal and
 18819	SÃ³nyaâs refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they
 18820	would meet.
 18821	
 18822	DÃ³lokhovâs clear, cold glance met RostÃ³v as soon as he entered the
 18823	door, as though he had long expected him.
 18824	
 18825	âItâs a long time since we met,â he said. âThanks for coming.
 18826	Iâll just finish dealing, and then IlyÃºshka will come with his
 18827	chorus.â
 18828	
 18829	âI called once or twice at your house,â said RostÃ³v, reddening.
 18830	
 18831	DÃ³lokhov made no reply.
 18832	
 18833	âYou may punt,â he said.
 18834	
 18835	RostÃ³v recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
 18836	with DÃ³lokhov. âNone but fools trust to luck in play,â DÃ³lokhov
 18837	had then said.
 18838	
 18839	âOr are you afraid to play with me?â DÃ³lokhov now asked as if
 18840	guessing RostÃ³vâs thought.
 18841	
 18842	Beneath his smile RostÃ³v saw in him the mood he had shown at the club
 18843	dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt
 18844	a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.
 18845	
 18846	RostÃ³v felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with
 18847	which to reply to DÃ³lokhovâs words. But before he had thought of
 18848	anything, DÃ³lokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and
 18849	deliberately so that everyone could hear:
 18850	
 18851	âDo you remember we had a talk about cards... âHeâs a fool who
 18852	trusts to luck, one should make certain,â and I want to try.â
 18853	
 18854	âTo try his luck or the certainty?â RostÃ³v asked himself.
 18855	
 18856	âWell, youâd better not play,â DÃ³lokhov added, and springing a
 18857	new pack of cards said: âBank, gentlemen!â
 18858	
 18859	Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. RostÃ³v sat down by his
 18860	side and at first did not play. DÃ³lokhov kept glancing at him.
 18861	
 18862	âWhy donât you play?â he asked.
 18863	
 18864	And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a
 18865	card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.
 18866	
 18867	âI have no money with me,â he said.
 18868	
 18869	âIâll trust you.â
 18870	
 18871	RostÃ³v staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again
 18872	lost. DÃ³lokhov âkilled,â that is, beat, ten cards of RostÃ³vâs
 18873	running.
 18874	
 18875	âGentlemen,â said DÃ³lokhov after he had dealt for some time.
 18876	âPlease place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the
 18877	reckoning.â
 18878	
 18879	One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.
 18880	
 18881	âYes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I
 18882	ask you to put the money on your cards,â replied DÃ³lokhov. âDonât
 18883	stint yourself, weâll settle afterwards,â he added, turning to
 18884	RostÃ³v.
 18885	
 18886	The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.
 18887	
 18888	All RostÃ³vâs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored
 18889	up against him. He wrote â800 rublesâ on a card, but while the
 18890	waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual
 18891	stake of twenty rubles.
 18892	
 18893	âLeave it,â said DÃ³lokhov, though he did not seem to be even
 18894	looking at RostÃ³v, âyouâll win it back all the sooner. I lose to
 18895	the others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?â he asked again.
 18896	
 18897	RostÃ³v submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven
 18898	of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He
 18899	well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts,
 18900	on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written â800 rublesâ in
 18901	clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was
 18902	handed him, smiled at DÃ³lokhovâs words, and with a sinking heart,
 18903	waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at DÃ³lokhovâs hands which held
 18904	the pack. Much depended on RostÃ³vâs winning or losing on that seven
 18905	of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son
 18906	two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked speaking of money
 18907	difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all he could let him have
 18908	till May, and asked him to be more economical this time. Nicholas had
 18909	replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his
 18910	word of honor not to take anything more till the spring. Now only twelve
 18911	hundred rubles was left of that money, so that this seven of hearts
 18912	meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the
 18913	necessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart he watched
 18914	DÃ³lokhovâs hands and thought, âNow then, make haste and let me have
 18915	this card and Iâll take my cap and drive home to supper with DenÃ­sov,
 18916	NatÃ¡sha, and SÃ³nya, and will certainly never touch a card again.â At
 18917	that moment his home life, jokes with PÃ©tya, talks with SÃ³nya, duets
 18918	with NatÃ¡sha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed
 18919	in the house on the PovarskÃ¡ya rose before him with such vividness,
 18920	clearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and
 18921	unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid
 18922	chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left,
 18923	might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly
 18924	illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined
 18925	misery. That could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the
 18926	movement of DÃ³lokhovâs hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy
 18927	wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took
 18928	up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.
 18929	
 18930	âSo you are not afraid to play with me?â repeated DÃ³lokhov, and as
 18931	if about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his
 18932	chair, and began deliberately with a smile:
 18933	
 18934	âYes, gentlemen, Iâve been told thereâs a rumor going about Moscow
 18935	that Iâm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.â
 18936	
 18937	âCome now, deal!â exclaimed RostÃ³v.
 18938	
 18939	âOh, those Moscow gossips!â said DÃ³lokhov, and he took up the cards
 18940	with a smile.
 18941	
 18942	âAah!â RostÃ³v almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The
 18943	seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had
 18944	lost more than he could pay.
 18945	
 18946	âStill, donât ruin yourself!â said DÃ³lokhov with a side glance at
 18947	RostÃ³v as he continued to deal.
 18948	
 18949	
 18950	
 18951	
 18952	
 18953	CHAPTER XIV
 18954	
 18955	An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested
 18956	in their own play.
 18957	
 18958	The whole interest was concentrated on RostÃ³v. Instead of sixteen
 18959	hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,
 18960	which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely
 18961	supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already
 18962	exceeded twenty thousand rubles. DÃ³lokhov was no longer listening to
 18963	stories or telling them, but followed every movement of RostÃ³vâs
 18964	hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had
 18965	decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand. He
 18966	had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and
 18967	SÃ³nyaâs joint ages. RostÃ³v, leaning his head on both hands, sat at
 18968	the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine,
 18969	and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him:
 18970	that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from
 18971	under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held him
 18972	in their power.
 18973	
 18974	âSix hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it backâs
 18975	impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or
 18976	quits... it canât be!... And why is he doing this to me?â RostÃ³v
 18977	pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but DÃ³lokhov refused to
 18978	accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at
 18979	one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge
 18980	over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand
 18981	from the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the
 18982	cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the
 18983	total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other
 18984	players, or peered at the now cold face of DÃ³lokhov and tried to read
 18985	what was passing in his mind.
 18986	
 18987	âHe knows of course what this loss means to me. He canât want my
 18988	ruin. Wasnât he my friend? Wasnât I fond of him? But itâs not his
 18989	fault. Whatâs he to do if he has such luck?... And itâs not my fault
 18990	either,â he thought to himself, âI have done nothing wrong. Have I
 18991	killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible
 18992	misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to
 18993	this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that
 18994	casket for Mammaâs name day and then going home. I was so happy, so
 18995	free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I was! When did
 18996	that end and when did this new, terrible state of things begin? What
 18997	marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place at this table,
 18998	chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the
 18999	same way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well and strong
 19000	and still the same and in the same place. No, it canât be! Surely it
 19001	will all end in nothing!â
 19002	
 19003	He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot.
 19004	His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless
 19005	efforts to seem calm.
 19006	
 19007	The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand.
 19008	RostÃ³v had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he
 19009	meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when
 19010	DÃ³lokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began
 19011	rapidly adding up the total of RostÃ³vâs debt, breaking the chalk as
 19012	he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.
 19013	
 19014	âSupper, itâs time for supper! And here are the gypsies!â
 19015	
 19016	Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside
 19017	and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it
 19018	was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:
 19019	
 19020	âWell, wonât you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,â as if it
 19021	were the fun of the game which interested him most.
 19022	
 19023	âItâs all up! Iâm lost!â thought he. âNow a bullet through my
 19024	brainâthatâs all thatâs left me!â And at the same time he said
 19025	in a cheerful voice:
 19026	
 19027	âCome now, just this one more little card!â
 19028	
 19029	âAll right!â said DÃ³lokhov, having finished the addition. âAll
 19030	right! Twenty-one rubles,â he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one
 19031	by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and
 19032	taking up a pack he prepared to deal. RostÃ³v submissively unbent the
 19033	corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended,
 19034	carefully wrote twenty-one.
 19035	
 19036	âItâs all the same to me,â he said. âI only want to see whether
 19037	you will let me win this ten, or beat it.â
 19038	
 19039	DÃ³lokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how RostÃ³v detested at that
 19040	moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists,
 19041	which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.
 19042	
 19043	âYou owe forty-three thousand, Count,â said DÃ³lokhov, and
 19044	stretching himself he rose from the table. âOne does get tired sitting
 19045	so long,â he added.
 19046	
 19047	âYes, Iâm tired too,â said RostÃ³v.
 19048	
 19049	DÃ³lokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to
 19050	jest.
 19051	
 19052	âWhen am I to receive the money, Count?â
 19053	
 19054	RostÃ³v, flushing, drew DÃ³lokhov into the next room.
 19055	
 19056	âI cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?â he said.
 19057	
 19058	âI say, RostÃ³v,â said DÃ³lokhov clearly, smiling and looking
 19059	Nicholas straight in the eyes, âyou know the saying, âLucky in love,
 19060	unlucky at cards.â Your cousin is in love with you, I know.â
 19061	
 19062	âOh, itâs terrible to feel oneself so in this manâs power,â
 19063	thought RostÃ³v. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and
 19064	mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to
 19065	escape it all, and felt that DÃ³lokhov knew that he could save him from
 19066	all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does
 19067	with a mouse.
 19068	
 19069	âYour cousin...â DÃ³lokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted
 19070	him.
 19071	
 19072	âMy cousin has nothing to do with this and itâs not necessary to
 19073	mention her!â he exclaimed fiercely.
 19074	
 19075	âThen when am I to have it?â
 19076	
 19077	âTomorrow,â replied RostÃ³v and left the room.

 19083	CHAPTER XV
 19084	
 19085	To say âtomorrowâ and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult,
 19086	but to go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father,
 19087	confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of
 19088	honor, was terrible.
 19089	
 19090	At home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after returning
 19091	from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord.
 19092	As soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere
 19093	of love which pervaded the RostÃ³v household that winter and, now after
 19094	DÃ³lokhovâs proposal and Iogelâs ball, seemed to have grown thicker
 19095	round SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha as the air does before a thunderstorm. SÃ³nya
 19096	and NatÃ¡sha, in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater,
 19097	looking pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord,
 19098	happy and smiling. VÃ©ra was playing chess with ShinshÃ­n in the drawing
 19099	room. The old countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son,
 19100	sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house.
 19101	DenÃ­sov, with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord
 19102	striking chords with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his
 19103	eyes rolling as he sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some
 19104	verses called âEnchantress,â which he had composed, and to which he
 19105	was trying to fit music:
 19106	
 19107	   Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre
 19108	   What magic power is this recalls me still?
 19109	   What spark has set my inmost soul on fire,
 19110	   What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?
 19111	
 19112	He was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling
 19113	black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy NatÃ¡sha.
 19114	
 19115	âSplendid! Excellent!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha. âAnother verse,â she
 19116	said, without noticing Nicholas.
 19117	
 19118	âEverythingâs still the same with them,â thought Nicholas,
 19119	glancing into the drawing room, where he saw VÃ©ra and his mother with
 19120	the old lady.
 19121	
 19122	âAh, and hereâs Nicholas!â cried NatÃ¡sha, running up to him.
 19123	
 19124	âIs Papa at home?â he asked.
 19125	
 19126	âI am so glad youâve come!â said NatÃ¡sha, without answering him.
 19127	âWe are enjoying ourselves! VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich is staying a day longer
 19128	for my sake! Did you know?â
 19129	
 19130	âNo, Papa is not back yet,â said SÃ³nya.
 19131	
 19132	âNicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!â called the old countess
 19133	from the drawing room.
 19134	
 19135	Nicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her
 19136	table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing
 19137	room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade
 19138	NatÃ¡sha to sing.
 19139	
 19140	âAll wight! All wight!â shouted DenÃ­sov. âItâs no good making
 19141	excuses now! Itâs your turn to sing the baâcawollaâI entweat
 19142	you!â
 19143	
 19144	The countess glanced at her silent son.
 19145	
 19146	âWhat is the matter?â she asked.
 19147	
 19148	âOh, nothing,â said he, as if weary of being continually asked the
 19149	same question. âWill Papa be back soon?â
 19150	
 19151	âI expect so.â
 19152	
 19153	âEverythingâs the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where
 19154	am I to go?â thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing room
 19155	where the clavichord stood.
 19156	
 19157	SÃ³nya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to
 19158	DenÃ­sovâs favorite barcarolle. NatÃ¡sha was preparing to sing.
 19159	DenÃ­sov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.
 19160	
 19161	Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.
 19162	
 19163	âWhy do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? Thereâs
 19164	nothing to be happy about!â thought he.
 19165	
 19166	SÃ³nya struck the first chord of the prelude.
 19167	
 19168	âMy God, Iâm a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain
 19169	is the only thing left meânot singing!â his thoughts ran on. âGo
 19170	away? But where to? Itâs oneâlet them sing!â
 19171	
 19172	He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at DenÃ­sov and the
 19173	girls and avoiding their eyes.
 19174	
 19175	âNikÃ³lenka, what is the matter?â SÃ³nyaâs eyes fixed on him
 19176	seemed to ask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him.
 19177	
 19178	Nicholas turned away from her. NatÃ¡sha too, with her quick instinct,
 19179	had instantly noticed her brotherâs condition. But, though she noticed
 19180	it, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from
 19181	sorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself
 19182	as young people often do. âNo, I am too happy now to spoil my
 19183	enjoyment by sympathy with anyoneâs sorrow,â she felt, and she said
 19184	to herself: âNo, I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as
 19185	I am.â
 19186	
 19187	âNow, SÃ³nya!â she said, going to the very middle of the room, where
 19188	she considered the resonance was best.
 19189	
 19190	Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet
 19191	dancers do, NatÃ¡sha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes,
 19192	stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.
 19193	
 19194	âYes, thatâs me!â she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with
 19195	which DenÃ­sov followed her.
 19196	
 19197	âAnd what is she so pleased about?â thought Nicholas, looking at his
 19198	sister. âWhy isnât she dull and ashamed?â
 19199	
 19200	NatÃ¡sha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose,
 19201	her eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her
 19202	surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may
 19203	produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which
 19204	leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
 19205	you and make you weep.
 19206	
 19207	NatÃ¡sha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,
 19208	mainly because DenÃ­sov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang
 19209	as a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish,
 19210	painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing
 19211	well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: âIt is not trained,
 19212	but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained.â Only they generally
 19213	said this some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained
 19214	voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was
 19215	sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in
 19216	it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal
 19217	freshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet untrained
 19218	velvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that
 19219	it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling
 19220	it.
 19221	
 19222	âWhat is this?â thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely
 19223	opened eyes. âWhat has happened to her? How she is singing today!â
 19224	And suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the
 19225	next note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into
 19226	three beats: âOh mio crudele affetto.â... One, two, three... one,
 19227	two, three... One... âOh mio crudele affetto.â... One, two, three...
 19228	One. âOh, this senseless life of ours!â thought Nicholas. âAll
 19229	this misery, and money, and DÃ³lokhov, and anger, and honorâitâs all
 19230	nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, NatÃ¡sha, now then, dearest!
 19231	Now then, darling! How will she take that si? Sheâs taken it! Thank
 19232	God!â And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si
 19233	he sung a second, a third below the high note. âAh, God! How fine! Did
 19234	I really take it? How fortunate!â he thought.
 19235	
 19236	Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest
 19237	in RostÃ³vâs soul! And this something was apart from everything else
 19238	in the world and above everything in the world. âWhat were losses, and
 19239	DÃ³lokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob
 19240	and yet be happy....â
 19241	
 19242	
 19243	
 19244	
 19245	
 19246	CHAPTER XVI
 19247	
 19248	It was long since RostÃ³v had felt such enjoyment from music as he
 19249	did that day. But no sooner had NatÃ¡sha finished her barcarolle than
 19250	reality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and went
 19251	downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count
 19252	came in from his club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him
 19253	drive up, went to meet him.
 19254	
 19255	âWellâhad a good time?â said the old count, smiling gaily and
 19256	proudly at his son.
 19257	
 19258	Nicholas tried to say âYes,â but could not: and he nearly burst into
 19259	sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his sonâs
 19260	condition.
 19261	
 19262	âAh, it canât be avoided!â thought Nicholas, for the first and
 19263	last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel
 19264	ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him
 19265	have the carriage to drive to town:
 19266	
 19267	âPapa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I
 19268	need some money.â
 19269	
 19270	âDear me!â said his father, who was in a specially good humor. âI
 19271	told you it would not be enough. How much?â
 19272	
 19273	âVery much,â said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless
 19274	smile, for which he was long unable to forgive himself, âI have lost a
 19275	little, I mean a good deal, a great dealâforty three thousand.â
 19276	
 19277	âWhat! To whom?... Nonsense!â cried the count, suddenly reddening
 19278	with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.
 19279	
 19280	âI promised to pay tomorrow,â said Nicholas.
 19281	
 19282	âWell!...â said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking
 19283	helplessly on the sofa.
 19284	
 19285	âIt canât be helped! It happens to everyone!â said the son, with
 19286	a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a
 19287	worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He
 19288	longed to kiss his fatherâs hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness,
 19289	but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to
 19290	everyone!
 19291	
 19292	The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his sonâs words and began
 19293	bustlingly searching for something.
 19294	
 19295	âYes, yes,â he muttered, âit will be difficult, I fear, difficult
 19296	to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?â
 19297	
 19298	And with a furtive glance at his sonâs face, the count went out of the
 19299	room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all
 19300	expected this.
 19301	
 19302	âPapa! Pa-pa!â he called after him, sobbing, âforgive me!â And
 19303	seizing his fatherâs hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into
 19304	tears.
 19305	
 19306	While father and son were having their explanation, the mother and
 19307	daughter were having one not less important. NatÃ¡sha came running to
 19308	her mother, quite excited.
 19309	
 19310	âMamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...â
 19311	
 19312	âMade what?â
 19313	
 19314	âMade, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!â she exclaimed.
 19315	
 19316	The countess did not believe her ears. DenÃ­sov had proposed. To whom?
 19317	To this chit of a girl, NatÃ¡sha, who not so long ago was playing with
 19318	dolls and who was still having lessons.
 19319	
 19320	âDonât, NatÃ¡sha! What nonsense!â she said, hoping it was a joke.
 19321	
 19322	âNonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,â said NatÃ¡sha
 19323	indignantly. âI come to ask you what to do, and you call it
 19324	ânonsense!ââ
 19325	
 19326	The countess shrugged her shoulders.
 19327	
 19328	âIf it is true that Monsieur DenÃ­sov has made you a proposal, tell
 19329	him he is a fool, thatâs all!â
 19330	
 19331	âNo, heâs not a fool!â replied NatÃ¡sha indignantly and seriously.
 19332	
 19333	âWell then, what do you want? Youâre all in love nowadays. Well,
 19334	if you are in love, marry him!â said the countess, with a laugh of
 19335	annoyance. âGood luck to you!â
 19336	
 19337	âNo, Mamma, Iâm not in love with him, I suppose Iâm not in love
 19338	with him.â
 19339	
 19340	âWell then, tell him so.â
 19341	
 19342	âMamma, are you cross? Donât be cross, dear! Is it my fault?â
 19343	
 19344	âNo, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?â
 19345	said the countess smiling.
 19346	
 19347	âNo, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. Itâs all very
 19348	well for you,â said NatÃ¡sha, with a responsive smile. âYou should
 19349	have seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came
 19350	out accidently.â
 19351	
 19352	âWell, all the same, you must refuse him.â
 19353	
 19354	âNo, I mustnât. I am so sorry for him! Heâs so nice.â
 19355	
 19356	âWell then, accept his offer. Itâs high time for you to be
 19357	married,â answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.
 19358	
 19359	âNo, Mamma, but Iâm so sorry for him. I donât know how Iâm to
 19360	say it.â
 19361	
 19362	âAnd thereâs nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself,â
 19363	said the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this
 19364	little NatÃ¡sha as grown up.
 19365	
 19366	âNo, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and youâll listen
 19367	at the door,â and NatÃ¡sha ran across the drawing room to the dancing
 19368	hall, where DenÃ­sov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord
 19369	with his face in his hands.
 19370	
 19371	He jumped up at the sound of her light step.
 19372	
 19373	âNataly,â he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, âdecide my
 19374	fate. It is in your hands.â
 19375	
 19376	âVasÃ­li DmÃ­trich, Iâm so sorry for you!... No, but you are so
 19377	nice... but it wonât do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always
 19378	love you.â
 19379	
 19380	DenÃ­sov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not
 19381	understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they
 19382	heard the quick rustle of the countessâ dress. She came up to them.
 19383	
 19384	âVasÃ­li DmÃ­trich, I thank you for the honor,â she said, with an
 19385	embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to DenÃ­sovââbut my
 19386	daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my sonâs friend, you
 19387	would have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not
 19388	have obliged me to give this refusal.â
 19389	
 19390	âCountess...â said DenÃ­sov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face.
 19391	He tried to say more, but faltered.
 19392	
 19393	NatÃ¡sha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began
 19394	to sob aloud.
 19395	
 19396	âCountess, I have done wâong,â DenÃ­sov went on in an unsteady
 19397	voice, âbut believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family
 19398	that I would give my life twice over...â He looked at the countess,
 19399	and seeing her severe face said: âWell, good-by, Countess,â and
 19400	kissing her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without
 19401	looking at NatÃ¡sha.
 19402	
 19403	
 19404	Next day RostÃ³v saw DenÃ­sov off. He did not wish to stay another
 19405	day in Moscow. All DenÃ­sovâs Moscow friends gave him a farewell
 19406	entertainment at the gypsiesâ, with the result that he had no
 19407	recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three
 19408	stages of his journey.
 19409	
 19410	After DenÃ­sovâs departure, RostÃ³v spent another fortnight in Moscow,
 19411	without going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could
 19412	not at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girlsâ room.
 19413	
 19414	SÃ³nya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she
 19415	wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her
 19416	love him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of
 19417	her.
 19418	
 19419	He filled the girlsâ albums with verses and music, and having at last
 19420	sent DÃ³lokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his
 19421	receipt, he left at the end of November, without taking leave of any of
 19422	his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland.

 19434	CHAPTER I
 19435	
 19436	After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the
 19437	TorzhÃ³k post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster
 19438	would not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing,
 19439	he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big
 19440	feet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.
 19441	
 19442	âWill you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and
 19443	tea?â asked his valet.
 19444	
 19445	Pierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had
 19446	begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same
 19447	questionâone so important that he took no notice of what went
 19448	on around him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to
 19449	Petersburg earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at this
 19450	station, but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a
 19451	matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for
 19452	the rest of his life.
 19453	
 19454	The postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling
 19455	TorzhÃ³k embroidery came into the room offering their services.
 19456	Without changing his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his
 19457	spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on
 19458	living without having solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had
 19459	been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from
 19460	SokÃ³lniki after the duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless
 19461	night. But now, in the solitude of the journey, they seized him with
 19462	special force. No matter what he thought about, he always returned to
 19463	these same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to
 19464	ask himself. It was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his
 19465	life together were stripped, so that the screw could not get in or out,
 19466	but went on turning uselessly in the same place.
 19467	
 19468	The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
 19469	wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency
 19470	have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted
 19471	to get more money from the traveler.
 19472	
 19473	âIs this good or bad?â Pierre asked himself. âIt is good for me,
 19474	bad for another traveler, and for himself itâs unavoidable, because
 19475	he needs money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a
 19476	thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses.
 19477	But the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as
 19478	possible. And I,â continued Pierre, âshot DÃ³lokhov because I
 19479	considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they
 19480	considered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who
 19481	executed himâalso for some reason. What is bad? What is good? What
 19482	should one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am I?
 19483	What is life, and what is death? What power governs all?â
 19484	
 19485	There was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that
 19486	not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was:
 19487	âYouâll die and all will end. Youâll die and know all, or cease
 19488	asking.â But dying was also dreadful.
 19489	
 19490	The TorzhÃ³k peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her
 19491	wares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. âI have hundreds of
 19492	rubles I donât know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered
 19493	cloak looking timidly at me,â he thought. âAnd what does she
 19494	want the money for? As if that money could add a hairâs breadth to
 19495	happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me
 19496	less a prey to evil and death?âdeath which ends all and must come
 19497	today or tomorrowâat any rate, in an instant as compared with
 19498	eternity.â And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread,
 19499	and again it turned uselessly in the same place.
 19500	
 19501	His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by
 19502	Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
 19503	struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. âAnd why did she resist
 19504	her seducer when she loved him?â he thought. âGod could not have put
 19505	into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wifeâas she
 19506	once wasâdid not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been
 19507	found out, nothing discovered,â Pierre again said to himself. âAll
 19508	we can know is that we know nothing. And thatâs the height of human
 19509	wisdom.â
 19510	
 19511	Everything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and
 19512	repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre
 19513	found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.
 19514	
 19515	âI make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this
 19516	gentleman,â said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another
 19517	traveler, also detained for lack of horses.
 19518	
 19519	The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old
 19520	man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite
 19521	grayish color.
 19522	
 19523	Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that
 19524	had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who,
 19525	with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the
 19526	aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots
 19527	on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin
 19528	coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with
 19529	its broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at BezÃºkhov. The
 19530	stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He
 19531	felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his
 19532	mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his
 19533	eyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of
 19534	them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
 19535	deathâs head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as
 19536	it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant
 19537	was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,
 19538	evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown.
 19539	This active old servant was unpacking the travelerâs canteen and
 19540	preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was
 19541	ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a
 19542	tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom
 19543	he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the
 19544	need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this
 19545	stranger.
 19546	
 19547	The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an
 19548	unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be
 19549	wanted.
 19550	
 19551	    * To indicate he did not want more tea.
 19552	
 19553	âNo. Give me the book,â said the stranger.
 19554	
 19555	The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work,
 19556	and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at
 19557	once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again,
 19558	leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former
 19559	position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time
 19560	to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and
 19561	severe gaze straight on Pierreâs face.
 19562	
 19563	Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old
 19564	eyes attracted him irresistibly.
 19565	
 19566	
 19567	
 19568	
 19569	
 19570	CHAPTER II
 19571	
 19572	âI have the pleasure of addressing Count BezÃºkhov, if I am not
 19573	mistaken,â said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.
 19574	
 19575	Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.
 19576	
 19577	âI have heard of you, my dear sir,â continued the stranger, âand
 19578	of your misfortune.â He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to
 19579	sayââYes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what
 19580	happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.âââI regret it very
 19581	much, my dear sir.â
 19582	
 19583	Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent
 19584	forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.
 19585	
 19586	âI have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for
 19587	greater reasons.â
 19588	
 19589	He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way
 19590	of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant
 19591	to enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him
 19592	involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.
 19593	
 19594	âYou are unhappy, my dear sir,â the stranger continued. âYou
 19595	are young and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my
 19596	power.â
 19597	
 19598	âOh, yes!â said Pierre, with a forced smile. âI am very grateful
 19599	to you. Where are you traveling from?â
 19600	
 19601	The strangerâs face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but
 19602	in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
 19603	irresistibly attractive to Pierre.
 19604	
 19605	âBut if for any reason you donât feel inclined to talk to me,â
 19606	said the old man, âsay so, my dear sir.â And he suddenly smiled, in
 19607	an unexpected and tenderly paternal way.
 19608	
 19609	âOh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your
 19610	acquaintance,â said Pierre. And again, glancing at the strangerâs
 19611	hands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skullâa Masonic
 19612	sign.
 19613	
 19614	âAllow me to ask,â he said, âare you a Mason?â
 19615	
 19616	âYes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,â said the
 19617	stranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierreâs eyes. âAnd in
 19618	their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you.â
 19619	
 19620	âI am afraid,â said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the
 19621	confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own
 19622	habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefsââI am afraid I am very far
 19623	from understandingâhow am I to put it?âI am afraid my way of looking
 19624	at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one
 19625	another.â
 19626	
 19627	âI know your outlook,â said the Mason, âand the view of life you
 19628	mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts,
 19629	is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit
 19630	of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I
 19631	had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a
 19632	regrettable delusion.â
 19633	
 19634	âJust as I may suppose you to be deluded,â said Pierre, with a faint
 19635	smile.
 19636	
 19637	âI should never dare to say that I know the truth,â said the Mason,
 19638	whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness.
 19639	âNo one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone
 19640	with the cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our
 19641	forefather Adam to our own times, is that temple reared which is to be
 19642	a worthy dwelling place of the Great God,â he added, and closed his
 19643	eyes.
 19644	
 19645	âI ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in
 19646	God,â said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it
 19647	essential to speak the whole truth.
 19648	
 19649	The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with
 19650	millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he, poor
 19651	man, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.
 19652	
 19653	âYes, you do not know Him, my dear sir,â said the Mason. âYou
 19654	cannot know Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy.â
 19655	
 19656	âYes, yes, I am unhappy,â assented Pierre. âBut what am I to
 19657	do?â
 19658	
 19659	âYou know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You do
 19660	not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in
 19661	thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!â
 19662	pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.
 19663	
 19664	He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.
 19665	
 19666	âIf He were not,â he said quietly, âyou and I would not be
 19667	speaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom
 19668	hast thou denied?â he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and
 19669	authority in his voice. âWho invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence
 19670	came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being?
 19671	didst thou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the
 19672	existence of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful,
 19673	eternal, and infinite in all His attributes?...â
 19674	
 19675	He stopped and remained silent for a long time.
 19676	
 19677	Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.
 19678	
 19679	âHe exists, but to understand Him is hard,â the Mason began again,
 19680	looking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves
 19681	of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep
 19682	still. âIf it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could
 19683	bring him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to thee. But
 19684	how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity,
 19685	and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may
 19686	not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness
 19687	and sinfulness?â He paused again. âWho art thou? Thou dreamest that
 19688	thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words,â he
 19689	went on, with a somber and scornful smile. âAnd thou art more foolish
 19690	and unreasonable than a little child, who, playing with the parts of a
 19691	skillfully made watch, dares to say that, as he does not understand
 19692	its use, he does not believe in the master who made it. To know Him is
 19693	hard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to
 19694	attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but
 19695	in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His
 19696	greatness....â
 19697	
 19698	Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Masonâs face with
 19699	shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with
 19700	his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise
 19701	reasoning contained in the Masonâs words, or believed as a child
 19702	believes, in the speakerâs tone of conviction and earnestness, or
 19703	the tremor of the speakerâs voiceâwhich sometimes almost brokeâor
 19704	those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm
 19705	firmness and certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole
 19706	being (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own
 19707	dejection and hopelessness)âat any rate, Pierre longed with his whole
 19708	soul to believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort,
 19709	regeneration, and return to life.
 19710	
 19711	âHe is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,â said the
 19712	Mason.
 19713	
 19714	âI do not understand,â said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts
 19715	reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in
 19716	the Masonâs arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him.
 19717	âI donât understand,â he said, âhow it is that the mind of man
 19718	cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak.â
 19719	
 19720	The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.
 19721	
 19722	âThe highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish
 19723	to imbibe,â he said. âCan I receive that pure liquid into an impure
 19724	vessel and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself
 19725	can I retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.â
 19726	
 19727	âYes, yes, that is so,â said Pierre joyfully.
 19728	
 19729	âThe highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those
 19730	worldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into
 19731	which intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one.
 19732	The highest wisdom has but one scienceâthe science of the wholeâthe
 19733	science explaining the whole creation and manâs place in it. To
 19734	receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew oneâs inner
 19735	self, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to
 19736	perfect oneâs self. And to attain this end, we have the light called
 19737	conscience that God has implanted in our souls.â
 19738	
 19739	âYes, yes,â assented Pierre.
 19740	
 19741	âLook then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask
 19742	thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained
 19743	relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you
 19744	are clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all these
 19745	good gifts? Are you content with yourself and with your life?â
 19746	
 19747	âNo, I hate my life,â Pierre muttered, wincing.
 19748	
 19749	âThou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art
 19750	purified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir.
 19751	How have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving
 19752	everything from society and giving nothing in return. You have become
 19753	the possessor of wealth. How have you used it? What have you done
 19754	for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of thousands
 19755	of slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally? No! You have
 19756	profited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is what you have
 19757	done. Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your
 19758	neighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness. Then you married, my
 19759	dear sirâtook on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young
 19760	woman; and what have you done? You have not helped her to find the way
 19761	of truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and
 19762	misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not
 19763	know God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear
 19764	sir!â
 19765	
 19766	After these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again
 19767	leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre
 19768	looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved
 19769	his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, âYes, a vile,
 19770	idle, vicious life!â but dared not break the silence.
 19771	
 19772	The Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his
 19773	servant.
 19774	
 19775	âHow about the horses?â he asked, without looking at Pierre.
 19776	
 19777	âThe exchange horses have just come,â answered the servant. âWill
 19778	you not rest here?â
 19779	
 19780	âNo, tell them to harness.â
 19781	
 19782	âCan he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
 19783	all, and without promising to help me?â thought Pierre, rising with
 19784	downcast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at
 19785	the Mason. âYes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible
 19786	and profligate life, though I did not like it and did not want to,â
 19787	thought Pierre. âBut this man knows the truth and, if he wished to,
 19788	could disclose it to me.â
 19789	
 19790	Pierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The
 19791	traveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, began
 19792	fastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to BezÃºkhov, and
 19793	said in a tone of indifferent politeness:
 19794	
 19795	âWhere are you going to now, my dear sir?â
 19796	
 19797	âI?... Iâm going to Petersburg,â answered Pierre, in a childlike,
 19798	hesitating voice. âI thank you. I agree with all you have said. But
 19799	do not suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what you
 19800	would have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it is
 19801	I, above all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and
 19802	perhaps I may...â
 19803	
 19804	Pierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.
 19805	
 19806	The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.
 19807	
 19808	âHelp comes from God alone,â he said, âbut such measure of help as
 19809	our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to
 19810	Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarskiâ (he took out his notebook
 19811	and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four).
 19812	âAllow me to give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital,
 19813	first of all devote some time to solitude and self-examination and do
 19814	not resume your former way of life. And now I wish you a good journey,
 19815	my dear sir,â he added, seeing that his servant had entered... âand
 19816	success.â
 19817	
 19818	The traveler was Joseph AlexÃ©evich BazdÃ©ev, as Pierre saw from the
 19819	postmasterâs book. BazdÃ©ev had been one of the best-known Freemasons
 19820	and Martinists, even in NovÃ­kovâs time. For a long while after he had
 19821	gone, Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down
 19822	the room, pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense
 19823	of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable,
 19824	virtuous future that seemed to him so easy. It seemed to him that he had
 19825	been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to
 19826	be virtuous. Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He
 19827	firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in
 19828	the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue, and that is how
 19829	Freemasonry presented itself to him.

 19835	CHAPTER III
 19836	
 19837	On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival,
 19838	he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas Ã  Kempis, whose
 19839	book had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually
 19840	realized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto unknown to him,
 19841	of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection, and in the
 19842	possibility of active brotherly love among men, which Joseph AlexÃ©evich
 19843	had revealed to him. A week after his arrival, the young Polish count,
 19844	Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society, came
 19845	into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in
 19846	which DÃ³lokhovâs second had called on him, and, having closed the
 19847	door behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the
 19848	room, addressed Pierre.
 19849	
 19850	âI have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,â he
 19851	said without sitting down. âA person of very high standing in our
 19852	Brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order
 19853	before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I
 19854	consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that personâs wishes. Do you wish
 19855	to enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?â
 19856	
 19857	The cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met
 19858	at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women,
 19859	surprised Pierre.
 19860	
 19861	âYes, I do wish it,â said he.
 19862	
 19863	Willarski bowed his head.
 19864	
 19865	âOne more question, Count,â he said, âwhich I beg you to answer
 19866	in all sincerityânot as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you
 19867	renounced your former convictionsâdo you believe in God?â
 19868	
 19869	Pierre considered.
 19870	
 19871	âYes... yes, I believe in God,â he said.
 19872	
 19873	âIn that case...â began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.
 19874	
 19875	âYes, I do believe in God,â he repeated.
 19876	
 19877	âIn that case we can go,â said Willarski. âMy carriage is at your
 19878	service.â
 19879	
 19880	Willarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierreâs inquiries as
 19881	to what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that
 19882	brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to
 19883	tell the truth.
 19884	
 19885	Having entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its
 19886	headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small
 19887	well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of
 19888	a servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange
 19889	attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said
 19890	something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small
 19891	wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen
 19892	before. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound
 19893	Pierreâs eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind, catching some
 19894	hairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew his face down, kissed him, and
 19895	taking him by the hand led him forward. The hairs tied in the knot hurt
 19896	Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile.
 19897	His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, though
 19898	smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.
 19899	
 19900	Having led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.
 19901	
 19902	âWhatever happens to you,â he said, âyou must bear it all manfully
 19903	if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.â (Pierre nodded
 19904	affirmatively.) âWhen you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover
 19905	your eyes,â added Willarski. âI wish you courage and success,â
 19906	and, pressing Pierreâs hand, he went out.
 19907	
 19908	Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice
 19909	he shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if
 19910	wishing to take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent
 19911	with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb,
 19912	his legs almost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He
 19913	experienced a variety of most complex sensations. He felt afraid of what
 19914	would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear. He felt
 19915	curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to
 19916	him; but most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had come when he
 19917	would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively
 19918	virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met Joseph
 19919	AlexÃ©evich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took the bandage
 19920	off his eyes and glanced around him. The room was in black darkness,
 19921	only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went nearer
 19922	and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book.
 19923	The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a
 19924	human skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading the first words
 19925	of the Gospel: âIn the beginning was the Word and the Word was with
 19926	God,â Pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled
 19927	with something. It was a coffin with bones inside. He was not at all
 19928	surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite
 19929	unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even more
 19930	unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospelâit
 19931	seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more. Trying
 19932	to stimulate his emotions he looked around. âGod, death, love, the
 19933	brotherhood of man,â he kept saying to himself, associating these
 19934	words with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and someone came in.
 19935	
 19936	By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he
 19937	saw a rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the
 19938	darkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the
 19939	table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.
 19940	
 19941	This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and
 19942	part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high
 19943	white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from
 19944	below.
 19945	
 19946	âFor what have you come hither?â asked the newcomer, turning in
 19947	Pierreâs direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. âWhy have
 19948	you, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not
 19949	seen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue,
 19950	enlightenment?â
 19951	
 19952	At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a
 19953	sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at
 19954	confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete
 19955	stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated
 19956	breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the
 19957	brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was
 19958	known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew,
 19959	SmolyanÃ­nov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an
 19960	acquaintanceâhe wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor.
 19961	For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to
 19962	repeat his question.
 19963	
 19964	âYes... I... I... desire regeneration,â Pierre uttered with
 19965	difficulty.
 19966	
 19967	âVery well,â said SmolyanÃ­nov, and went on at once: âHave you any
 19968	idea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your
 19969	aim?â said he quietly and quickly.
 19970	
 19971	âI... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,â said Pierre,
 19972	with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his
 19973	excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
 19974	Russian.
 19975	
 19976	âWhat is your conception of Freemasonry?â
 19977	
 19978	âI imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who
 19979	have virtuous aims,â said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy
 19980	of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. âI
 19981	imagine...â
 19982	
 19983	âGood!â said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with
 19984	this answer. âHave you sought for means of attaining your aim in
 19985	religion?â
 19986	
 19987	âNo, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,â said Pierre,
 19988	so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was
 19989	saying. âI have been an atheist,â answered Pierre.
 19990	
 19991	âYou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,
 19992	therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?â said the
 19993	Rhetor, after a momentâs pause.
 19994	
 19995	âYes, yes,â assented Pierre.
 19996	
 19997	The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast,
 19998	and began to speak.
 19999	
 20000	âNow I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,â he said,
 20001	âand if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood
 20002	with profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on
 20003	which it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation
 20004	and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery... which
 20005	has come down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first manâa
 20006	mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this
 20007	mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be
 20008	prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope
 20009	to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing
 20010	our members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and
 20011	enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition from those
 20012	who have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby to render them
 20013	capable of receiving it.
 20014	
 20015	âBy purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve
 20016	the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety
 20017	and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which
 20018	sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you again.â
 20019	
 20020	âTo combat the evil which sways the world...â Pierre repeated, and a
 20021	mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind.
 20022	He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he
 20023	addressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself
 20024	vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed,
 20025	imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three
 20026	objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind,
 20027	especially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the
 20028	Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential,
 20029	and the second aim, that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not
 20030	much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he
 20031	was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all
 20032	that was good.
 20033	
 20034	Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the
 20035	seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomonâs temple,
 20036	which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were:
 20037	1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedience to
 20038	those of higher ranks in the Order. 3. Morality. 4. Love of mankind. 5.
 20039	Courage. 6. Generosity. 7. The love of death.
 20040	
 20041	âIn the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death,â the
 20042	Rhetor said, âto bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but
 20043	as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue
 20044	from this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and
 20045	peace.â
 20046	
 20047	âYes, that must be so,â thought Pierre, when after these words the
 20048	Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. âIt must be so,
 20049	but I am still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only
 20050	now gradually opening before me.â But five of the other virtues which
 20051	Pierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt already in his
 20052	soul: courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind, and especially
 20053	obedienceâwhich did not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now
 20054	felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will
 20055	to those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh
 20056	virtue was and could not recall it.
 20057	
 20058	The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre
 20059	whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
 20060	all that would be required of him.
 20061	
 20062	âI am ready for everything,â said Pierre.
 20063	
 20064	âI must also inform you,â said the Rhetor, âthat our Order
 20065	delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means, which
 20066	may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom
 20067	and virtue than mere words. This chamber with what you see therein
 20068	should already have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than
 20069	words could do. You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a
 20070	like method of enlightenment. Our Order imitates the ancient societies
 20071	that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,â said
 20072	the Rhetor, âis an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses
 20073	but which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol.â
 20074	
 20075	Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He
 20076	listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his
 20077	ordeal was about to begin.
 20078	
 20079	âIf you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,â said the Rhetor
 20080	coming closer to Pierre. âIn token of generosity I ask you to give me
 20081	all your valuables.â
 20082	
 20083	âBut I have nothing here,â replied Pierre, supposing that he was
 20084	asked to give up all he possessed.
 20085	
 20086	âWhat you have with you: watch, money, rings....â
 20087	
 20088	Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for
 20089	some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been
 20090	done, the Rhetor said:
 20091	
 20092	âIn token of obedience, I ask you to undress.â
 20093	
 20094	Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the
 20095	Rhetorâs instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierreâs
 20096	left breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers
 20097	to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
 20098	and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
 20099	trouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him
 20100	a slipper for his left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment,
 20101	doubt, and self-derision, which appeared on his face against his will,
 20102	Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his
 20103	brother Rhetor, and awaited his further commands.
 20104	
 20105	âAnd now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief
 20106	passion,â said the latter.
 20107	
 20108	âMy passion! I have had so many,â replied Pierre.
 20109	
 20110	âThat passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the
 20111	path of virtue,â said the Mason.
 20112	
 20113	Pierre paused, seeking a reply.
 20114	
 20115	âWine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?â
 20116	He went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give
 20117	the pre-eminence.
 20118	
 20119	âWomen,â he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.
 20120	
 20121	The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this
 20122	answer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay
 20123	on the table, again bound his eyes.
 20124	
 20125	âFor the last time I say to youâturn all your attention upon
 20126	yourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in
 20127	passion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not without
 20128	us but within....â
 20129	
 20130	Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source
 20131	of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.
 20132	
 20133	
 20134	
 20135	
 20136	
 20137	CHAPTER IV
 20138	
 20139	Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not
 20140	the Rhetor but Pierreâs sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his
 20141	voice. To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre
 20142	replied: âYes, yes, I agree,â and with a beaming, childlike smile,
 20143	his fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered
 20144	and one booted foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his
 20145	bare chest. He was conducted from that room along passages that turned
 20146	backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the
 20147	Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with
 20148	mallets, the doors opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still
 20149	blindfolded) questioned him as to who he was, when and where he was
 20150	born, and so on. Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded,
 20151	and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his
 20152	pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the
 20153	universe, and of the courage with which he should endure toils and
 20154	dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken
 20155	of now as the âSeeker,â now as the âSufferer,â and now as the
 20156	âPostulant,â to the accompaniment of various knockings with
 20157	mallets and swords. As he was being led up to some object he noticed a
 20158	hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors. He heard those around
 20159	him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be
 20160	led along a certain carpet. After that they took his right hand, placed
 20161	it on something, and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left
 20162	breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud
 20163	an oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles were then
 20164	extinguished and some spirit lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and
 20165	he was told that he would now see the lesser light. The bandage was
 20166	taken off his eyes and, by the faint light of the burning spirit,
 20167	Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men standing before him, wearing
 20168	aprons like the Rhetorâs and holding swords in their hands pointed at
 20169	his breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with
 20170	blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the
 20171	swords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from
 20172	him and he was at once blindfolded again.
 20173	
 20174	âNow thou hast seen the lesser light,â uttered a voice. Then the
 20175	candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the
 20176	bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together: âSic
 20177	transit gloria mundi.â
 20178	
 20179	Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
 20180	and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some
 20181	twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them
 20182	Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the Presidentâs chair sat a
 20183	young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his
 20184	neck. On his right sat the Italian abbÃ© whom Pierre had met at
 20185	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs two years before. There were also present a very
 20186	distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the
 20187	KurÃ¡ginsâ. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words
 20188	of the President, who held a mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was
 20189	a star-shaped light. At one side of the table was a small carpet with
 20190	various figures worked upon it, at the other was something resembling an
 20191	altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven large
 20192	candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pierre
 20193	up to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie down,
 20194	saying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple.
 20195	
 20196	âHe must first receive the trowel,â whispered one of the brothers.
 20197	
 20198	âOh, hush, please!â said another.
 20199	
 20200	Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
 20201	obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. âWhere am I? What am
 20202	I doing? Arenât they laughing at me? Shanât I be ashamed to remember
 20203	this?â But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at
 20204	the serious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone
 20205	through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast
 20206	at his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling,
 20207	prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the
 20208	feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. When
 20209	he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather
 20210	apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel
 20211	and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He
 20212	told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that
 20213	apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained
 20214	trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice,
 20215	and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the
 20216	first pair of gloves, a manâs, he said that Pierre could not know
 20217	their meaning but must keep them. The second pair of manâs gloves
 20218	he was to wear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of
 20219	womenâs gloves, he said: âDear brother, these womanâs gloves are
 20220	intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most
 20221	of all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom
 20222	you select to be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry.â And after a pause,
 20223	he added: âBut beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not deck
 20224	hands that are unclean.â While the Grand Master said these last words
 20225	it seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still
 20226	more confused, blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes, began
 20227	looking about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed.
 20228	
 20229	This silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the
 20230	rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of
 20231	all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a
 20232	trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and
 20233	so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of
 20234	the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit down.
 20235	The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very long, and
 20236	Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to
 20237	understand what was being read. He managed to follow only the last words
 20238	of the statutes and these remained in his mind.
 20239	
 20240	âIn our temples we recognize no other distinctions,â read the Grand
 20241	Master, âbut those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any
 20242	distinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brotherâs aid
 20243	whoever he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth,
 20244	never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous.
 20245	Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy
 20246	neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy
 20247	enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling
 20248	the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which
 20249	thou hast lost.â
 20250	
 20251	He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears
 20252	of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the
 20253	congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all
 20254	sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only
 20255	brothers, and burned with impatience to set to work with them.
 20256	
 20257	The Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down in
 20258	their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of
 20259	humility.
 20260	
 20261	The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed,
 20262	and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of âCollector
 20263	of Almsâ went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked
 20264	to subscribe all he had, but fearing that it might look like pride
 20265	subscribed the same amount as the others.
 20266	
 20267	The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had
 20268	returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had
 20269	become completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits
 20270	and way of life.
 20271	
 20272	
 20273	
 20274	
 20275	
 20276	CHAPTER V
 20277	
 20278	The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at
 20279	home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,
 20280	one side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third
 20281	physical things, and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then
 20282	his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in
 20283	imagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he
 20284	had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it
 20285	would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his
 20286	estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs.
 20287	He was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince VasÃ­li suddenly
 20288	entered the room.
 20289	
 20290	âMy dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you
 20291	quarreled with HÃ©lÃ¨ne, mon cher? You are under a delusion,â said
 20292	Prince VasÃ­li, as he entered. âI know all about it, and I can tell
 20293	you positively that HÃ©lÃ¨ne is as innocent before you as Christ was
 20294	before the Jews.â
 20295	
 20296	Pierre was about to reply, but Prince VasÃ­li interrupted him.
 20297	
 20298	âAnd why didnât you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I
 20299	know all about it and understand it all,â he said. âYou behaved as
 20300	becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we wonât
 20301	go into that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and
 20302	me in the eyes of society, and even of the court,â he added, lowering
 20303	his voice. âShe is living in Moscow and you are here. Remember,
 20304	dear boy,â and he drew Pierreâs arm downwards, âit is simply a
 20305	misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her
 20306	a letter at once, and sheâll come here and all will be explained, or
 20307	else, my dear boy, let me tell you itâs quite likely youâll have to
 20308	suffer for it.â
 20309	
 20310	Prince VasÃ­li gave Pierre a significant look.
 20311	
 20312	âI know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a
 20313	keen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to
 20314	HÃ©lÃ¨ne.â
 20315	
 20316	Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince VasÃ­li
 20317	did not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to
 20318	speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had
 20319	firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the
 20320	Masonic statutes, âbe kindly and courteous,â recurred to him. He
 20321	blinked, went red, got up and sat down again, struggling with himself
 20322	to do what was for him the most difficult thing in lifeâto say an
 20323	unpleasant thing to a manâs face, to say what the other, whoever
 20324	he might be, did not expect. He was so used to submitting to Prince
 20325	VasÃ­liâs tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he would be
 20326	unable to withstand it now, but he also felt that on what he said now
 20327	his future dependedâwhether he would follow the same old road, or that
 20328	new path so attractively shown him by the Masons, on which he firmly
 20329	believed he would be reborn to a new life.
 20330	
 20331	âNow, dear boy,â said Prince VasÃ­li playfully, âsay âyes,â
 20332	and Iâll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.â
 20333	
 20334	But before Prince VasÃ­li had finished his playful speech, Pierre,
 20335	without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his
 20336	father, muttered in a whisper:
 20337	
 20338	âPrince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!â And he jumped up
 20339	and opened the door for him.
 20340	
 20341	âGo!â he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of
 20342	confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince VasÃ­liâs face.
 20343	
 20344	âWhatâs the matter with you? Are you ill?â
 20345	
 20346	âGo!â the quivering voice repeated. And Prince VasÃ­li had to go
 20347	without receiving any explanation.
 20348	
 20349	A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons,
 20350	and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his
 20351	estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons
 20352	and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.
 20353	
 20354	
 20355	
 20356	
 20357	
 20358	CHAPTER VI
 20359	
 20360	The duel between Pierre and DÃ³lokhov was hushed up and, in spite of
 20361	the Emperorâs severity regarding duels at that time, neither the
 20362	principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel,
 20363	confirmed by Pierreâs rupture with his wife, was the talk of society.
 20364	Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was
 20365	an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best
 20366	match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his
 20367	marriageâwhen the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing
 20368	to hope from himâespecially as he did not know how, and did not
 20369	wish, to court societyâs favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had
 20370	happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his
 20371	father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierreâs
 20372	departure HÃ©lÃ¨ne returned to Petersburg, she was received by all her
 20373	acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade of deference
 20374	due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her husband HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 20375	assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic tact she had
 20376	acquired though she did not understand its significance. This expression
 20377	suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly
 20378	and that her husband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince VasÃ­li
 20379	expressed his opinion more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre
 20380	was mentioned and, pointing to his forehead, remarked:
 20381	
 20382	âA bit touchedâI always said so.â
 20383	
 20384	âI said from the first,â declared Anna PÃ¡vlovna referring to
 20385	Pierre, âI said at the time and before anyone elseâ (she insisted
 20386	on her priority) âthat that senseless young man was spoiled by the
 20387	depraved ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody
 20388	was in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and
 20389	when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees.
 20390	And how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold
 20391	all that has happened.â
 20392	
 20393	Anna PÃ¡vlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
 20394	soirees as beforeâsuch as she alone had the gift of arrangingâat
 20395	which was to be found âthe cream of really good society, the bloom
 20396	of the intellectual essence of Petersburg,â as she herself put it.
 20397	Besides this refined selection of society Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs receptions
 20398	were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new
 20399	and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the
 20400	state of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court
 20401	society so dearly and distinctly indicated.
 20402	
 20403	Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleonâs
 20404	destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt and the
 20405	surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our
 20406	troops had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon
 20407	was beginning, Anna PÃ¡vlovna gave one of her soirees. The âcream of
 20408	really good societyâ consisted of the fascinating HÃ©lÃ¨ne, forsaken
 20409	by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had
 20410	just returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man
 20411	referred to in that drawing room as âa man of great meritâ (un homme
 20412	de beaucoup de mÃ©rite), a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother,
 20413	and several other less noteworthy persons.
 20414	
 20415	The novelty Anna PÃ¡vlovna was setting before her guests that evening
 20416	was BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, who had just arrived as a special messenger from
 20417	the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.
 20418	
 20419	The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that
 20420	evening was this:
 20421	
 20422	âWhatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to
 20423	countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance and
 20424	mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease
 20425	to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the
 20426	King of Prussia and others: âSo much the worse for you. Tu lâas
 20427	voulu, George Dandin,â thatâs all we have to say about it!â
 20428	
 20429	When BorÃ­s, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing
 20430	room, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided
 20431	by Anna PÃ¡vlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and
 20432	the hope of an alliance with her.
 20433	
 20434	BorÃ­s, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed,
 20435	entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an
 20436	aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and
 20437	then brought back to the general circle.
 20438	
 20439	Anna PÃ¡vlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to
 20440	several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description
 20441	of each.
 20442	
 20443	âPrince Hippolyte KurÃ¡ginâcharming young fellow; M.
 20444	Kronq,âchargÃ© dâaffaires from Copenhagenâa profound intellect,â
 20445	and simply, âMr. ShÃ­tovâa man of great meritââthis of the man
 20446	usually so described.
 20447	
 20448	Thanks to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâs efforts, his own tastes, and the
 20449	peculiarities of his reserved nature, BorÃ­s had managed during his
 20450	service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a
 20451	very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to
 20452	Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had
 20453	become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had
 20454	been so pleased at OlmÃ¼tz and according to which an ensign might rank
 20455	incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was
 20456	needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or
 20457	perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can
 20458	grant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his
 20459	success and at the inability of others to understand these things.
 20460	In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all
 20461	his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were
 20462	completely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to
 20463	be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many
 20464	pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear
 20465	in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He made friends with
 20466	and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and
 20467	who could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and despised
 20468	Moscow. The remembrance of the RostÃ³vsâ house and of his childish
 20469	love for NatÃ¡sha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see
 20470	the RostÃ³vs since the day of his departure for the army. To be in Anna
 20471	PÃ¡vlovnaâs drawing room he considered an important step up in the
 20472	service, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make
 20473	use of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned
 20474	each face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with
 20475	each of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took
 20476	the seat indicated to him beside the fair HÃ©lÃ¨ne and listened to the
 20477	general conversation.
 20478	
 20479	âVienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable
 20480	that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure
 20481	them, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the
 20482	actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,â said the Danish chargÃ©
 20483	dâaffaires.
 20484	
 20485	âThe doubt is flattering,â said âthe man of profound intellect,â
 20486	with a subtle smile.
 20487	
 20488	âWe must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of
 20489	Austria,â said Mortemart. âThe Emperor of Austria can never have
 20490	thought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.â
 20491	
 20492	âAh, my dear vicomte,â put in Anna PÃ¡vlovna, âLâUropeâ (for
 20493	some reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined
 20494	French pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with
 20495	a Frenchman), âLâUrope ne sera jamais notre alliÃ©e sincÃ¨re.â *
 20496	
 20497	    * âEurope will never be our sincere ally.â
 20498	
 20499	
 20500	After that Anna PÃ¡vlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King
 20501	of Prussia, in order to draw BorÃ­s into the conversation.
 20502	
 20503	BorÃ­s listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn,
 20504	but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the
 20505	beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome
 20506	young aide-de-camp with a smile.
 20507	
 20508	Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna PÃ¡vlovna very naturally asked
 20509	BorÃ­s to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he
 20510	found the Prussian army. BorÃ­s, speaking with deliberation, told them
 20511	in pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies and
 20512	the court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his
 20513	own about the facts he was recounting. For some time he engrossed the
 20514	general attention, and Anna PÃ¡vlovna felt that the novelty she had
 20515	served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors. The greatest
 20516	attention of all to BorÃ­sâ narrative was shown by HÃ©lÃ¨ne. She asked
 20517	him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in
 20518	the state of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to
 20519	him with her usual smile.
 20520	
 20521	âYou absolutely must come and see me,â she said in a tone that
 20522	implied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was
 20523	absolutely necessary.
 20524	
 20525	âOn Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.â
 20526	
 20527	BorÃ­s promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a
 20528	conversation with her, when Anna PÃ¡vlovna called him away on the
 20529	pretext that her aunt wished to hear him.
 20530	
 20531	âYou know her husband, of course?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, closing her
 20532	eyes and indicating HÃ©lÃ¨ne with a sorrowful gesture. âAh, she is
 20533	such an unfortunate and charming woman! Donât mention him before
 20534	herâplease donât! It is too painful for her!â
 20535	
 20536	
 20537	
 20538	
 20539	
 20540	CHAPTER VII
 20541	
 20542	When BorÃ­s and Anna PÃ¡vlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte
 20543	had the ear of the company.
 20544	
 20545	Bending forward in his armchair he said: âLe Roi de Prusse!â and
 20546	having said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.
 20547	
 20548	âLe Roi de Prusse?â Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing,
 20549	and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna PÃ¡vlovna
 20550	waited for him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more
 20551	she began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the
 20552	sword of Frederick the Great.
 20553	
 20554	âIt is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...â she began, but
 20555	Hippolyte interrupted her with the words: âLe Roi de Prusse...â and
 20556	again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no
 20557	more.
 20558	
 20559	Anna PÃ¡vlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyteâs friend, addressed him
 20560	firmly.
 20561	
 20562	âCome now, what about your Roi de Prusse?â
 20563	
 20564	Hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.
 20565	
 20566	âOh, itâs nothing. I only wished to say...â (he wanted to repeat
 20567	a joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that
 20568	evening to get in) âI only wished to say that we are wrong to fight
 20569	pour le Roi de Prusse!â
 20570	
 20571	BorÃ­s smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical
 20572	or appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody
 20573	laughed.
 20574	
 20575	âYour joke is too bad, itâs witty but unjust,â said Anna
 20576	PÃ¡vlovna, shaking her little shriveled finger at him.
 20577	
 20578	âWe are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles.
 20579	Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!â she said.
 20580	
 20581	The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the
 20582	political news. It became particularly animated toward the end of the
 20583	evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.
 20584	
 20585	âYou know Nâ Nâ received a snuffbox with the portrait last
 20586	year?â said âthe man of profound intellect.â âWhy shouldnât
 20587	Sâ Sâ get the same distinction?â
 20588	
 20589	âPardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperorâs portrait is a reward but
 20590	not a distinction,â said the diplomatistââa gift, rather.â
 20591	
 20592	âThere are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.â
 20593	
 20594	âItâs impossible,â replied another.
 20595	
 20596	âWill you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter....â
 20597	
 20598	When everybody rose to go, HÃ©lÃ¨ne who had spoken very little all
 20599	the evening again turned to BorÃ­s, asking him in a tone of caressing
 20600	significant command to come to her on Tuesday.
 20601	
 20602	âIt is of great importance to me,â she said, turning with a smile
 20603	toward Anna PÃ¡vlovna, and Anna PÃ¡vlovna, with the same sad smile with
 20604	which she spoke of her exalted patroness, supported HÃ©lÃ¨neâs wish.
 20605	
 20606	It seemed as if from some words BorÃ­s had spoken that evening about the
 20607	Prussian army, HÃ©lÃ¨ne had suddenly found it necessary to see him.
 20608	She seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on
 20609	Tuesday.
 20610	
 20611	But on Tuesday evening, having come to HÃ©lÃ¨neâs splendid salon,
 20612	BorÃ­s received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for
 20613	him to come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to
 20614	him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly
 20615	and in a whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: âCome to dinner
 20616	tomorrow... in the evening. You must come.... Come!â
 20617	
 20618	During that stay in Petersburg, BorÃ­s became an intimate in the
 20619	countessâ house.
 20620	
 20621	
 20622	
 20623	
 20624	
 20625	CHAPTER VIII
 20626	
 20627	The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere one
 20628	heard curses on Bonaparte, âthe enemy of mankind.â Militiamen and
 20629	recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of
 20630	war came contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously
 20631	interpreted. The life of old Prince BolkÃ³nski, Prince Andrew, and
 20632	Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.
 20633	
 20634	In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
 20635	then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia.
 20636	Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable
 20637	since the time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think
 20638	it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor
 20639	himself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy
 20640	and strength. He was continually traveling through the three provinces
 20641	entrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe
 20642	to cruel with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the
 20643	minutest details himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in
 20644	mathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went
 20645	to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his
 20646	grandfather called him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet
 20647	nurse and nurse SÃ¡vishna in the late princessâ rooms and Princess
 20648	Mary spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a motherâs place to
 20649	her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed
 20650	passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself
 20651	to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angelâas she
 20652	called her nephewâand playing with him.
 20653	
 20654	Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the
 20655	tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument
 20656	brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
 20657	fly upwards. The angelâs upper lip was slightly raised as though
 20658	about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and
 20659	Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angelâs face reminded
 20660	them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger,
 20661	though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the
 20662	expression the sculptor had happened to give the angelâs face, Prince
 20663	Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead
 20664	wife: âAh, why have you done this to me?â
 20665	
 20666	Soon after Prince Andrewâs return the old prince made over to him a
 20667	large estate, BoguchÃ¡rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills.
 20668	Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills,
 20669	partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with
 20670	his fatherâs peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude,
 20671	Prince Andrew made use of BoguchÃ¡rovo, began building and spent most of
 20672	his time there.
 20673	
 20674	After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not
 20675	to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced
 20676	and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the
 20677	recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son
 20678	seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man,
 20679	roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign,
 20680	while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and
 20681	secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.
 20682	
 20683	On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.
 20684	Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his fatherâs
 20685	absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who
 20686	had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters
 20687	for Prince Andrew.
 20688	
 20689	Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
 20690	letters to Princess Maryâs apartments, but did not find him there. He
 20691	was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.
 20692	
 20693	âIf you please, your excellency, PÃ©trusha has brought some papers,â
 20694	said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a
 20695	childâs little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he
 20696	poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.
 20697	
 20698	âWhat is it?â he said crossly, and, his hand shaking
 20699	unintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the
 20700	mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought
 20701	it.
 20702	
 20703	There were in the room a childâs cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a
 20704	table, a childâs table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew
 20705	was sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on
 20706	the table, screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall
 20707	on the cot.
 20708	
 20709	âMy dear,â said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside
 20710	the cot where she was standing, âbetter wait a bit... later...â
 20711	
 20712	âOh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things
 20713	offâand this is what comes of it!â said Prince Andrew in an
 20714	exasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.
 20715	
 20716	âMy dear, really... itâs better not to wake him... heâs asleep,â
 20717	said the princess in a tone of entreaty.
 20718	
 20719	Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass
 20720	in hand.
 20721	
 20722	âPerhaps weâd really better not wake him,â he said hesitating.
 20723	
 20724	âAs you please... really... I think so... but as you please,â said
 20725	Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion
 20726	had prevailed. She drew her brotherâs attention to the maid who was
 20727	calling him in a whisper.
 20728	
 20729	It was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy
 20730	who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household
 20731	doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had
 20732	been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness
 20733	and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and
 20734	reproached and disputed with each other.
 20735	
 20736	âPÃ©trusha has come with papers from your father,â whispered the
 20737	maid.
 20738	
 20739	Prince Andrew went out.
 20740	
 20741	âDevil take them!â he muttered, and after listening to the verbal
 20742	instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
 20743	fatherâs letter, he returned to the nursery.
 20744	
 20745	âWell?â he asked.
 20746	
 20747	âStill the same. Wait, for heavenâs sake. Karl IvÃ¡nich always says
 20748	that sleep is more important than anything,â whispered Princess Mary
 20749	with a sigh.
 20750	
 20751	Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.
 20752	
 20753	âConfound you and your Karl IvÃ¡nich!â He took the glass with the
 20754	drops and again went up to the cot.
 20755	
 20756	âAndrew, donât!â said Princess Mary.
 20757	
 20758	But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes,
 20759	and stooped glass in hand over the infant.
 20760	
 20761	âBut I wish it,â he said. âI beg youâgive it him!â
 20762	
 20763	Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively
 20764	and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed
 20765	hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat
 20766	down on a sofa in the next room.
 20767	
 20768	He still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he
 20769	began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote
 20770	in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:
 20771	
 20772	Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful
 20773	newsâif itâs not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete
 20774	victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing,
 20775	and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a
 20776	GermanâI congratulate him! I canât make out what the commander at
 20777	KÃ³rchevoâa certain KhandrikÃ³vâis up to; till now the additional
 20778	men and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and
 20779	say Iâll have his head off if everything is not here in a week.
 20780	Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle
 20781	from PÃ©tenkaâhe took part in itâand itâs all true. When
 20782	mischief-makers donât meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is
 20783	said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to KÃ³rchevo
 20784	without delay and carry out instructions!
 20785	
 20786	Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was
 20787	a closely written letter of two sheets from BilÃ­bin. He folded it up
 20788	without reading it and reread his fatherâs letter, ending with the
 20789	words: âGallop off to KÃ³rchevo and carry out instructions!â
 20790	
 20791	âNo, pardon me, I wonât go now till the child is better,â thought
 20792	he, going to the door and looking into the nursery.
 20793	
 20794	Princess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.
 20795	
 20796	âAh yes, and what else did he say thatâs unpleasant?â thought
 20797	Prince Andrew, recalling his fatherâs letter. âYes, we have gained
 20798	a victory over Bonaparte, just when Iâm not serving. Yes, yes, heâs
 20799	always poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!â And he began reading
 20800	BilÃ­binâs letter which was written in French. He read without
 20801	understanding half of it, read only to forget, if but for a moment, what
 20802	he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all
 20803	else.
 20804	
 20805	
 20806	
 20807	
 20808	
 20809	CHAPTER IX
 20810	
 20811	BilÃ­bin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and
 20812	though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms,
 20813	he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and
 20814	self-derision genuinely Russian. BilÃ­bin wrote that the obligation of
 20815	diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince
 20816	Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he
 20817	had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army.
 20818	The letter was old, having been written before the battle at
 20819	Preussisch-Eylau.
 20820	
 20821	âSince the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,â wrote
 20822	BilÃ­bin, âas you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I
 20823	have certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me;
 20824	what I have seen during these last three months is incredible.
 20825	
 20826	âI begin ab ovo. âThe enemy of the human race,â as you know,
 20827	attacks the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have
 20828	only betrayed us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but
 20829	it turns out that âthe enemy of the human raceâ pays no heed to
 20830	our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the
 20831	Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun,
 20832	and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs
 20833	himself in the palace at Potsdam.
 20834	
 20835	ââI most ardently desire,â writes the King of Prussia to
 20836	Bonaparte, âthat Your Majesty should be received and treated in my
 20837	palace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances
 20838	allowed, I have hastened to take all steps to that end. May I have
 20839	succeeded!â The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to
 20840	the French and lay down their arms at the first demand.
 20841	
 20842	âThe head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the
 20843	King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All
 20844	this is absolutely true.
 20845	
 20846	âIn short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude,
 20847	it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more,
 20848	in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have
 20849	everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely,
 20850	a commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success
 20851	might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so
 20852	young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of ProzorÃ³vski
 20853	and KÃ¡menski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us,
 20854	SuvÃ³rov-like, in a kibÃ­tka, and is received with acclamations of joy
 20855	and triumph.
 20856	
 20857	âOn the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails
 20858	are taken to the field marshalâs room, for he likes to do everything
 20859	himself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant
 20860	for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed
 20861	to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field marshal grows
 20862	impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor
 20863	to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild
 20864	furies and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens
 20865	them, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others. âAh! So
 20866	thatâs the way they treat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep
 20867	an eye on me! Very well then! Get along with you!â So he writes the
 20868	famous order of the day to General Bennigsen:
 20869	
 20870	ââI am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the
 20871	army. You have brought your army corps to PultÃºsk, routed: here it is
 20872	exposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as
 20873	you yourself reported to Count BuxhÃ¶wden yesterday, you must think of
 20874	retreating to our frontierâwhich do today.â
 20875	
 20876	ââFrom all my riding,â he writes to the Emperor, âI have got a
 20877	saddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents
 20878	my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the
 20879	command to the general next in seniority, Count BuxhÃ¶wden, having sent
 20880	him my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is
 20881	a lack of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only
 20882	one dayâs ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all,
 20883	as reported by the division commanders, Ostermann and SedmorÃ©tzki, and
 20884	all that the peasants had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in
 20885	hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover. In regard to which I humbly
 20886	submit my report, with the information that if the army remains in its
 20887	present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left
 20888	in it by spring.
 20889	
 20890	ââGrant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is
 20891	already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and
 20892	glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious
 20893	permission here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of a
 20894	secretary rather than commander in the army. My removal from the army
 20895	does not produce the slightest stirâa blind man has left it. There are
 20896	thousands such as I in Russia.â
 20897	
 20898	âThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all,
 20899	isnât it logical?
 20900	
 20901	âThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly
 20902	interesting and entertaining. After the field marshalâs departure
 20903	it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.
 20904	BuxhÃ¶wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen
 20905	does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who
 20906	are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity
 20907	to fight a battle âon his own handâ as the Germans say. He does so.
 20908	This is the battle of PultÃºsk, which is considered a great victory but
 20909	in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have
 20910	a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who
 20911	retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to
 20912	that it is we who lost the battle of PultÃºsk. In short, we retreat
 20913	after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a
 20914	victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the
 20915	post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up
 20916	the command of the army to General BuxhÃ¶wden. During this interregnum
 20917	we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is
 20918	no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to
 20919	avoid General BuxhÃ¶wden who by right of seniority should be our chief.
 20920	So energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable
 20921	river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at
 20922	the moment is not Bonaparte but BuxhÃ¶wden. General BuxhÃ¶wden was all
 20923	but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one
 20924	of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. BuxhÃ¶wden pursues
 20925	usâwe scuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our side before we
 20926	recross to the other. At last our enemy, BuxhÃ¶wden, catches us and
 20927	attacks. Both generals are angry, and the result is a challenge on
 20928	BuxhÃ¶wdenâs part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsenâs. But at the
 20929	critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at
 20930	PultÃºsk to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in
 20931	chief, and our first foe, BuxhÃ¶wden, is vanquished; we can now turn
 20932	our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But as it turns out, just at
 20933	that moment a third enemy rises before usânamely the Orthodox Russian
 20934	soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot!
 20935	The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting,
 20936	and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the
 20937	regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything
 20938	to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals
 20939	overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the marauders even
 20940	attack our headquarters, and the commander in chief has to ask for a
 20941	battalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks they carried off
 20942	my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give
 20943	all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much
 20944	fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.â
 20945	
 20946	At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while,
 20947	in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust
 20948	BilÃ­bin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When he
 20949	had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was
 20950	not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out
 20951	there in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes,
 20952	rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he
 20953	had read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he
 20954	thought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized with
 20955	alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was
 20956	reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.
 20957	
 20958	Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him
 20959	with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.
 20960	
 20961	âMy dear,â he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
 20962	him.
 20963	
 20964	As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was
 20965	seized by an unreasoning panicâit occurred to him that the child was
 20966	dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.
 20967	
 20968	âAll is over,â he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his
 20969	forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it
 20970	empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the
 20971	curtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could not
 20972	find the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he
 20973	lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow, and was smacking
 20974	his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.
 20975	
 20976	Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had
 20977	already lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him,
 20978	tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The soft
 20979	forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand; even
 20980	the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was not dead,
 20981	but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince Andrew
 20982	longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless
 20983	little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his
 20984	head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He
 20985	heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of
 20986	the cot. He did not look round, but still gazing at the infantâs face
 20987	listened to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary,
 20988	who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain,
 20989	and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her without
 20990	looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.
 20991	
 20992	âHe has perspired,â said Prince Andrew.
 20993	
 20994	âI was coming to tell you so.â
 20995	
 20996	The child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead
 20997	against the pillow.
 20998	
 20999	Prince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her
 21000	luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that
 21001	were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly
 21002	catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture
 21003	and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing
 21004	to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the
 21005	world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair
 21006	against the muslin of the curtain.
 21007	
 21008	âYes, this is the one thing left me now,â he said with a sigh.
 21009

 21014	CHAPTER X
 21015	
 21016	Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the
 21017	Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with
 21018	him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to
 21019	what he should do on his estates.
 21020	
 21021	When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office
 21022	and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps
 21023	would be taken immediately to free his serfsâand that till then they
 21024	were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies
 21025	were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs,
 21026	punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals,
 21027	asylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates. Some of
 21028	the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with
 21029	alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased
 21030	with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first
 21031	fright were amused by Pierreâs lisp and the new words they had not
 21032	heard before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while
 21033	the cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from
 21034	this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.
 21035	
 21036	The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierreâs intentions,
 21037	but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into
 21038	the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.
 21039	
 21040	Despite Count BezÃºkhovâs enormous wealth, since he had come into an
 21041	income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year,
 21042	Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him
 21043	an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the
 21044	following budget:
 21045	
 21046	About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about
 21047	30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house,
 21048	and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in
 21049	pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to
 21050	the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a
 21051	new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last
 21052	two years, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was
 21053	spent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the
 21054	chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests,
 21055	or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first
 21056	task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or
 21057	inclinationâpractical business.
 21058	
 21059	He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But
 21060	he felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these
 21061	consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
 21062	them or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state
 21063	of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the necessity of
 21064	paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor,
 21065	to which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that
 21066	steps should be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by
 21067	showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank,
 21068	and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.
 21069	
 21070	The steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling
 21071	the forests in the province of KostromÃ¡, the land lower down the river,
 21072	and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which
 21073	operations according to him were connected with such complicated
 21074	measuresâthe removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so
 21075	onâthat Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:
 21076	
 21077	âYes, yes, do so.â
 21078	
 21079	Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
 21080	to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried
 21081	to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward
 21082	for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these
 21083	consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to
 21084	himself.
 21085	
 21086	In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make
 21087	his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the
 21088	largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierreâs greatest
 21089	weaknessâthe one to which he had confessed when admitted to the
 21090	Lodgeâwere so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days,
 21091	weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much
 21092	occupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him
 21093	no time for reflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had
 21094	hoped to lead he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.
 21095	
 21096	Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not
 21097	fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral
 21098	life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked twoâmorality and the
 21099	love of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled
 21100	another of the preceptsâthat of reforming the human raceâand had
 21101	other virtuesâlove of his neighbor, and especially generosity.
 21102	
 21103	In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he
 21104	intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders
 21105	had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had
 21106	entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.
 21107	
 21108	The chief steward, who considered the young countâs attempts almost
 21109	insaneâunprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfsâmade
 21110	some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs
 21111	as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large
 21112	buildingsâschools, hospitals, and asylumsâon all the estates
 21113	before the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not for
 21114	ceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), but for just
 21115	such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of icons and the bread
 21116	and salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding of his
 21117	master, would touch and delude him.
 21118	
 21119	The southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna
 21120	carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on
 21121	Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque
 21122	than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly
 21123	grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions,
 21124	which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the
 21125	depth of his heart. In one place the peasants presented him with bread
 21126	and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission,
 21127	as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them,
 21128	to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor
 21129	of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In another place the women with
 21130	infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard
 21131	work. On a third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet
 21132	him surrounded by children whom, by the countâs generosity, he was
 21133	instructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre
 21134	saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection,
 21135	all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon
 21136	to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewardsâ accounts, according to
 21137	which the serfsâ manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the
 21138	touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue
 21139	coats.
 21140	
 21141	What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
 21142	with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and
 21143	Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peterâs day,
 21144	and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun
 21145	the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that
 21146	villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that
 21147	since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they
 21148	did still harder work on their own land. He did not know that the priest
 21149	who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and
 21150	that the pupilsâ parents wept at having to let him take their children
 21151	and secured their release by heavy payments. He did not know that the
 21152	brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs whose manorial
 21153	labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did not know
 21154	that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfsâ
 21155	payments had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work
 21156	had been increased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit
 21157	to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which
 21158	he had left Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his
 21159	âbrother-instructorâ as he called the Grand Master.
 21160	
 21161	âHow easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,â
 21162	thought Pierre, âand how little attention we pay to it!â
 21163	
 21164	He was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at
 21165	receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
 21166	for these simple, kindly people.
 21167	
 21168	The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
 21169	through the naÃ¯ve and intelligent count and played with him as with
 21170	a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,
 21171	pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
 21172	the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.
 21173	
 21174	Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
 21175	difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would
 21176	happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly,
 21177	on what he thought right. The steward promised to do all in his power to
 21178	carry out the countâs wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the
 21179	count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for
 21180	the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank,
 21181	but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the
 21182	newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued
 21183	to give in money and work all that other peopleâs serfs gaveâthat is
 21184	to say, all that could be got out of them.
 21185	
 21186	
 21187	
 21188	
 21189	
 21190	CHAPTER XI
 21191	
 21192	Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state
 21193	of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his
 21194	friend BolkÃ³nski, whom he had not seen for two years.
 21195	
 21196	BoguchÃ¡rovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among
 21197	fields and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The
 21198	house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and
 21199	with banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that
 21200	stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were
 21201	a few fir trees.
 21202	
 21203	The homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a
 21204	bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular faÃ§ade
 21205	still in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid
 21206	out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a
 21207	water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight,
 21208	the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of
 21209	tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply
 21210	to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly
 21211	built lodge close to the pond. AntÃ³n, a man who had looked after Prince
 21212	Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the
 21213	prince was at home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.
 21214	
 21215	Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after
 21216	the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in
 21217	Petersburg.
 21218	
 21219	He quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered
 21220	wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but AntÃ³n
 21221	ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.
 21222	
 21223	âWell, what is it?â came a sharp, unpleasant voice.
 21224	
 21225	âA visitor,â answered AntÃ³n.
 21226	
 21227	âAsk him to wait,â and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed
 21228	back.
 21229	
 21230	Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to
 21231	face with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre
 21232	embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
 21233	and looked at him closely.
 21234	
 21235	âWell, I did not expect you, I am very glad,â said Prince Andrew.
 21236	
 21237	Pierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He
 21238	was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a
 21239	smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in
 21240	spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous
 21241	and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more
 21242	manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used
 21243	to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
 21244	concentration on some one thought.
 21245	
 21246	As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation,
 21247	it was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They
 21248	put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to
 21249	be talked over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on
 21250	some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans
 21251	for the future, Pierreâs journeys and occupations, the war, and so
 21252	on. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his
 21253	friendâs look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile
 21254	with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful
 21255	animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would
 21256	have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not.
 21257	The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his
 21258	enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince
 21259	Andrewâs presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views,
 21260	which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour.
 21261	He checked himself, fearing to seem naÃ¯ve, yet he felt an irresistible
 21262	desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite
 21263	different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.
 21264	
 21265	âI canât tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly
 21266	know myself again.â
 21267	
 21268	âYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,â said Prince
 21269	Andrew.
 21270	
 21271	âWell, and you? What are your plans?â
 21272	
 21273	âPlans!â repeated Prince Andrew ironically. âMy plans?â he said,
 21274	as if astonished at the word. âWell, you see, Iâm building. I mean
 21275	to settle here altogether next year....â
 21276	
 21277	Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrewâs face,
 21278	which had grown much older.
 21279	
 21280	âNo, I meant to ask...â Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted
 21281	him.
 21282	
 21283	âBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels
 21284	and all you have been doing on your estates.â
 21285	
 21286	Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far
 21287	as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been
 21288	made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierreâs story of what he
 21289	had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened
 21290	not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was
 21291	telling him.
 21292	
 21293	Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friendâs company
 21294	and at last became silent.
 21295	
 21296	âIâll tell you what, my dear fellow,â said Prince Andrew, who
 21297	evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, âI am
 21298	only bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am going back
 21299	to my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of course you know
 21300	her already,â he said, evidently trying to entertain a visitor with
 21301	whom he now found nothing in common. âWe will go after dinner. And
 21302	would you now like to look round my place?â
 21303	
 21304	They went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political
 21305	news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other
 21306	intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of
 21307	the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here,
 21308	while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future
 21309	arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:
 21310	
 21311	âHowever, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then
 21312	weâll set off.â
 21313	
 21314	At dinner, conversation turned on Pierreâs marriage.
 21315	
 21316	âI was very much surprised when I heard of it,â said Prince Andrew.
 21317	
 21318	Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said
 21319	hurriedly: âI will tell you some time how it all happened. But you
 21320	know it is all over, and forever.â
 21321	
 21322	âForever?â said Prince Andrew. âNothingâs forever.â
 21323	
 21324	âBut you know how it all ended, donât you? You heard of the duel?â
 21325	
 21326	âAnd so you had to go through that too!â
 21327	
 21328	âOne thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,â said
 21329	Pierre.
 21330	
 21331	âWhy so?â asked Prince Andrew. âTo kill a vicious dog is a very
 21332	good thing really.â
 21333	
 21334	âNo, to kill a man is badâwrong.â
 21335	
 21336	âWhy is it wrong?â urged Prince Andrew. âIt is not given to man
 21337	to know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will
 21338	err, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.â
 21339	
 21340	âWhat does harm to another is wrong,â said Pierre, feeling with
 21341	pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was
 21342	roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to
 21343	his present state.
 21344	
 21345	âAnd who has told you what is bad for another man?â he asked.
 21346	
 21347	âBad! Bad!â exclaimed Pierre. âWe all know what is bad for
 21348	ourselves.â
 21349	
 21350	âYes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is
 21351	something I cannot inflict on others,â said Prince Andrew, growing
 21352	more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook
 21353	to Pierre. He spoke in French. âI only know two very real evils in
 21354	life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils.
 21355	To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy
 21356	now.â
 21357	
 21358	âAnd love of oneâs neighbor, and self-sacrifice?â began Pierre.
 21359	âNo, I canât agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and
 21360	not to have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for
 21361	myself and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least
 21362	tryingâ (Pierreâs modesty made him correct himself) âto live for
 21363	others, only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I
 21364	shall not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are
 21365	saying.â Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.
 21366	
 21367	âWhen you see my sister, Princess Mary, youâll get on with her,â
 21368	he said. âPerhaps you are right for yourself,â he added after
 21369	a short pause, âbut everyone lives in his own way. You lived for
 21370	yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness
 21371	when you began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I
 21372	lived for glory.âAnd after all what is glory? The same love of others,
 21373	a desire to do something for them, a desire for their approval.âSo I
 21374	lived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have
 21375	become calmer since I began to live only for myself.â
 21376	
 21377	âBut what do you mean by living only for yourself?â asked Pierre,
 21378	growing excited. âWhat about your son, your sister, and your
 21379	father?â
 21380	
 21381	âBut thatâs just the same as myselfâthey are not others,â
 21382	explained Prince Andrew. âThe others, oneâs neighbors, le prochain,
 21383	as you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and
 21384	evil. Le prochainâyour Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.â
 21385	
 21386	And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He
 21387	evidently wished to draw him on.
 21388	
 21389	âYou are joking,â replied Pierre, growing more and more excited.
 21390	âWhat error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even
 21391	doing a littleâthough I did very little and did it very badly? What
 21392	evil can there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like
 21393	ourselves, were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth
 21394	beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in
 21395	a comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and
 21396	consolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying
 21397	of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be
 21398	rendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum
 21399	for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a
 21400	peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give
 21401	them rest and leisure?â said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. âAnd
 21402	I have done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done
 21403	something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good
 21404	action, and more than that, you canât make me believe that you do not
 21405	think so yourself. And the main thing is,â he continued, âthat I
 21406	know, and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the
 21407	only sure happiness in life.â
 21408	
 21409	âYes, if you put it like that itâs quite a different matter,â said
 21410	Prince Andrew. âI build a house and lay out a garden, and you build
 21411	hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But whatâs
 21412	right and whatâs good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by
 21413	us. Well, you want an argument,â he added, âcome on then.â
 21414	
 21415	They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served
 21416	as a veranda.
 21417	
 21418	âCome, letâs argue then,â said Prince Andrew, âYou talk of
 21419	schools,â he went on, crooking a finger, âeducation and so forth;
 21420	that is, you want to raise himâ (pointing to a peasant who passed by
 21421	them taking off his cap) âfrom his animal condition and awaken in him
 21422	spiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only
 21423	happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of.
 21424	I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my
 21425	means. Then you say, âlighten his toil.â But as I see it, physical
 21426	labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as
 21427	mental activity is to you or me. You canât help thinking. I go to bed
 21428	after two in the morning, thoughts come and I canât sleep but toss
 21429	about till dawn, because I think and canât help thinking, just as
 21430	he canât help plowing and mowing; if he didnât, he would go to the
 21431	drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical
 21432	labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical
 21433	idleness, but would grow fat and die. The third thingâwhat else was
 21434	it you talked about?â and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. âAh,
 21435	yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and
 21436	bleed him and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to
 21437	everybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler for
 21438	him to die. Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is.
 21439	It would be different if you grudged losing a laborerâthatâs how I
 21440	regard himâbut you want to cure him from love of him. And he does not
 21441	want that. And besides, what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone!
 21442	Killed them, yes!â said he, frowning angrily and turning away from
 21443	Pierre.
 21444	
 21445	Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was
 21446	evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke
 21447	readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His
 21448	glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.
 21449	
 21450	âOh, that is dreadful, dreadful!â said Pierre. âI donât
 21451	understand how one can live with such ideas. I had such moments
 21452	myself not long ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I
 21453	collapsed so that I donât live at allâeverything seems hateful to
 21454	me... myself most of all. Then I donât eat, donât wash... and how is
 21455	it with you?...â
 21456	
 21457	âWhy not wash? That is not cleanly,â said Prince Andrew; âon the
 21458	contrary one must try to make oneâs life as pleasant as possible.
 21459	Iâm alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I
 21460	can without hurting others.â
 21461	
 21462	âBut with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit
 21463	without moving, undertaking nothing....â
 21464	
 21465	âLife as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do
 21466	nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the
 21467	honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get
 21468	out of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary
 21469	qualifications for itâthe kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness
 21470	necessary for the position. Then thereâs this house, which must be
 21471	built in order to have a nook of oneâs own in which to be quiet. And
 21472	now thereâs this recruiting.â
 21473	
 21474	âWhy arenât you serving in the army?â
 21475	
 21476	âAfter Austerlitz!â said Prince Andrew gloomily. âNo, thank you
 21477	very much! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active
 21478	Russian army. And I wonâtânot even if Bonaparte were here at
 21479	SmolÃ©nsk threatening Bald Hillsâeven then I wouldnât serve in the
 21480	Russian army! Well, as I was saying,â he continued, recovering his
 21481	composure, ânow thereâs this recruiting. My father is chief in
 21482	command of the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active
 21483	service is to serve under him.â
 21484	
 21485	âThen you are serving?â
 21486	
 21487	âI am.â
 21488	
 21489	He paused a little while.
 21490	
 21491	âAnd why do you serve?â
 21492	
 21493	âWhy, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of
 21494	his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too
 21495	energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is
 21496	terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of
 21497	the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late
 21498	a fortnight ago he would have had a paymasterâs clerk at YÃºkhnovna
 21499	hanged,â said Prince Andrew with a smile. âSo I am serving because
 21500	I alone have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him
 21501	from actions which would torment him afterwards.â
 21502	
 21503	âWell, there you see!â
 21504	
 21505	âYes, but it is not as you imagine,â Prince Andrew continued. âI
 21506	did not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk
 21507	who had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been
 21508	very glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my fatherâthat again
 21509	is for myself.â
 21510	
 21511	Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly
 21512	while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no
 21513	desire to do good to his neighbor.
 21514	
 21515	âThere now, you wish to liberate your serfs,â he continued; âthat
 21516	is a very good thing, but not for youâI donât suppose you ever had
 21517	anyone flogged or sent to Siberiaâand still less for your serfs. If
 21518	they are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I donât suppose they are
 21519	any the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the
 21520	stripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is
 21521	a good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon
 21522	themselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being
 21523	able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I
 21524	pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You
 21525	may not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those
 21526	traditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable,
 21527	become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain
 21528	themselves and grow more and more miserable.â
 21529	
 21530	Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking
 21531	that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his
 21532	fatherâs case.
 21533	
 21534	He did not reply.
 21535	
 21536	âSo thatâs what Iâm sorry forâhuman dignity, peace of mind,
 21537	purity, and not the serfsâ backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave
 21538	as you may, always remain the same backs and foreheads.â
 21539	
 21540	âNo, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you,â said
 21541	Pierre.
 21542	
 21543	
 21544	
 21545	
 21546	
 21547	CHAPTER XII
 21548	
 21549	In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
 21550	Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and
 21551	then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.
 21552	
 21553	Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in
 21554	his husbandry.
 21555	
 21556	Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and
 21557	apparently immersed in his own thoughts.
 21558	
 21559	He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not
 21560	see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and
 21561	raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that
 21562	Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching,
 21563	and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule
 21564	what to him was precious and sacred.
 21565	
 21566	âNo, but why do you think so?â Pierre suddenly began, lowering his
 21567	head and looking like a bull about to charge, âwhy do you think so?
 21568	You should not think so.â
 21569	
 21570	âThink? What about?â asked Prince Andrew with surprise.
 21571	
 21572	âAbout life, about manâs destiny. It canât be so. I myself thought
 21573	like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, donât
 21574	smile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought
 21575	it was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal,
 21576	aspects of humanity.â
 21577	
 21578	And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince
 21579	Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed
 21580	from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood,
 21581	and love.
 21582	
 21583	âOnly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest
 21584	is a dream,â said Pierre. âUnderstand, my dear fellow, that outside
 21585	this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you
 21586	that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out
 21587	his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our
 21588	fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up
 21589	to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I
 21590	have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
 21591	which is hidden in heaven,â said Pierre.
 21592	
 21593	Prince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to
 21594	Pierreâs words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented
 21595	his catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the
 21596	peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrewâs eyes and by his silence,
 21597	Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would
 21598	not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.
 21599	
 21600	They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to
 21601	cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it,
 21602	they also stepped on the raft.
 21603	
 21604	Prince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at
 21605	the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.
 21606	
 21607	âWell, what do you think about it?â Pierre asked. âWhy are you
 21608	silent?â
 21609	
 21610	âWhat do I think about it? I am listening to you. Itâs all very
 21611	well.... You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of
 21612	life, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who
 21613	are we? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what
 21614	you see? You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I donât
 21615	see it.â
 21616	
 21617	Pierre interrupted him.
 21618	
 21619	âDo you believe in a future life?â he asked.
 21620	
 21621	âA future life?â Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no
 21622	time to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he
 21623	knew Prince Andrewâs former atheistic convictions.
 21624	
 21625	âYou say you canât see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor
 21626	could I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end
 21627	of everything. On earth, here on this earthâ (Pierre pointed to
 21628	the fields), âthere is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the
 21629	universe, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who
 21630	are now the children of earth areâeternallyâchildren of the
 21631	whole universe. Donât I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast
 21632	harmonious whole? Donât I feel that I form one link, one step, between
 21633	the lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of
 21634	beings in whom the Deityâthe Supreme Power if you prefer the termâis
 21635	manifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man,
 21636	why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and
 21637	farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this
 21638	world, but that I shall always exist and always have existed. I feel
 21639	that beyond me and above me there are spirits, and that in this world
 21640	there is truth.â
 21641	
 21642	âYes, that is Herderâs theory,â said Prince Andrew, âbut it is
 21643	not that which can convince me, dear friendâlife and death are what
 21644	convince. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound
 21645	up with oneâs own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to
 21646	make it rightâ (Prince Andrewâs voice trembled and he turned away),
 21647	âand suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to
 21648	exist.... Why? It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe there
 21649	is.... Thatâs what convinces, that is what has convinced me,â said
 21650	Prince Andrew.
 21651	
 21652	âYes, yes, of course,â said Pierre, âisnât that what Iâm
 21653	saying?â
 21654	
 21655	âNo. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
 21656	necessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with
 21657	someone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere, and
 21658	you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked
 21659	in....â
 21660	
 21661	âWell, thatâs it then! You know that there is a there and there is a
 21662	Someone? There is the future life. The Someone isâGod.â
 21663	
 21664	Prince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been
 21665	taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half
 21666	below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near
 21667	the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen,
 21668	coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.
 21669	
 21670	âIf there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and
 21671	manâs highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must
 21672	live, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on
 21673	this scrap of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there, in
 21674	the Whole,â said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.
 21675	
 21676	Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to
 21677	Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the
 21678	sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre
 21679	became silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the
 21680	current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew felt as if the sound
 21681	of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierreâs words, whispering:
 21682	
 21683	âIt is true, believe it.â
 21684	
 21685	He sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at
 21686	Pierreâs face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his superior
 21687	friend.
 21688	
 21689	âYes, if it only were so!â said Prince Andrew. âHowever, it is
 21690	time to get on,â he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up
 21691	at the sky to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since
 21692	Austerlitz saw that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on
 21693	that battlefield; and something that had long been slumbering, something
 21694	that was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his
 21695	soul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions
 21696	of his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to
 21697	develop existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in
 21698	Prince Andrewâs life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the
 21699	same old way, inwardly he began a new life.
 21700

 21705	CHAPTER XIII
 21706	
 21707	It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front
 21708	entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house,
 21709	Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierreâs attention to a commotion
 21710	going on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her
 21711	back, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed
 21712	back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out
 21713	after them, and all four, looking round at the carriage, ran in dismay
 21714	up the steps of the back porch.
 21715	
 21716	âThose are Maryâs âGodâs folk,ââ said Prince Andrew. âThey
 21717	have mistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she
 21718	disobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she
 21719	receives them.â
 21720	
 21721	âBut what are âGodâs folkâ?â asked Pierre.
 21722	
 21723	Prince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them,
 21724	and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back
 21725	soon.
 21726	
 21727	The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.
 21728	
 21729	Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept
 21730	in perfect order and readiness for him in his fatherâs house; he
 21731	himself went to the nursery.
 21732	
 21733	âLet us go and see my sister,â he said to Pierre when he returned.
 21734	âI have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her
 21735	âGodâs folk.â It will serve her right, she will be confused, but
 21736	you will see her âGodâs folk.â Itâs really very curious.â
 21737	
 21738	âWhat are âGodâs folkâ?â asked Pierre.
 21739	
 21740	âCome, and youâll see for yourself.â
 21741	
 21742	Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face
 21743	when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon
 21744	stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monkâs
 21745	cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an
 21746	armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on
 21747	her childlike face.
 21748	
 21749	âAndrew, why didnât you warn me?â said the princess, with mild
 21750	reproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her
 21751	chickens.
 21752	
 21753	âCharmÃ©e de vous voir. Je suis trÃ¨s contente de vous voir,â * she
 21754	said to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and
 21755	now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above
 21756	all his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She
 21757	looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, âI
 21758	like you very much, but please donât laugh at my people.â After
 21759	exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.
 21760	
 21761	    * âDelighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.â
 21762	
 21763	
 21764	âAh, and IvÃ¡nushka is here too!â said Prince Andrew, glancing with
 21765	a smile at the young pilgrim.
 21766	
 21767	âAndrew!â said Princess Mary, imploringly. âIl faut que vous
 21768	sachiez que câest une femme,â * said Prince Andrew to Pierre.
 21769	
 21770	âAndrew, au nom de Dieu!â *(2) Princess Mary repeated.
 21771	
 21772	     * âYou must know that this is a woman.â
 21773	
 21774	     * (2) âFor heavenâs sake.â
 21775	
 21776	
 21777	It was evident that Prince Andrewâs ironical tone toward the pilgrims
 21778	and Princess Maryâs helpless attempts to protect them were their
 21779	customary long-established relations on the matter.
 21780	
 21781	âMais, ma bonne amie,â said Prince Andrew, âvous devriez au
 21782	contraire mâÃªtre reconnaissante de ce que jâexplique Ã  Pierre
 21783	votre intimitÃ© avec ce jeune homme.â *
 21784	
 21785	     * âBut, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to
 21786	     me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young
 21787	     man.â
 21788	
 21789	
 21790	âReally?â said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
 21791	seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into
 21792	IvÃ¡nushkaâs face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked
 21793	round at them all with crafty eyes.
 21794	
 21795	Princess Maryâs embarrassment on her peopleâs account was quite
 21796	unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering
 21797	her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup
 21798	upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat
 21799	quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea.
 21800	IvÃ¡nushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes
 21801	from under her brows at the young men.
 21802	
 21803	âWhere have you been? To Kiev?â Prince Andrew asked the old woman.
 21804	
 21805	âI have, good sir,â she answered garrulously. âJust at
 21806	Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly
 21807	sacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now Iâm from KolyÃ¡zin,
 21808	master, where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed.â
 21809	
 21810	âAnd was IvÃ¡nushka with you?â
 21811	
 21812	âI go by myself, benefactor,â said IvÃ¡nushka, trying to speak in a
 21813	bass voice. âI only came across PelagÃ©ya in YÃºkhnovo....â
 21814	
 21815	PelagÃ©ya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what
 21816	she had seen.
 21817	
 21818	âIn KolyÃ¡zin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.â
 21819	
 21820	âWhat is it? Some new relics?â asked Prince Andrew.
 21821	
 21822	âAndrew, do leave off,â said Princess Mary. âDonât tell him,
 21823	PelagÃ©ya.â
 21824	
 21825	âNo... why not, my dear, why shouldnât I? I like him. He is kind,
 21826	he is one of Godâs chosen, heâs a benefactor, he once gave me ten
 21827	rubles, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (heâs
 21828	one of Godâs own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says,
 21829	âWhy are you not going to the right place? Go to KolyÃ¡zin where a
 21830	wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.â On
 21831	hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went.â
 21832	
 21833	All were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones,
 21834	drawing in her breath.
 21835	
 21836	âSo I come, master, and the people say to me: âA great blessing has
 21837	been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother,
 21838	the Holy Virgin Mother of God.â...â
 21839	
 21840	âAll right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,â said Princess
 21841	Mary, flushing.
 21842	
 21843	âLet me ask her,â said Pierre. âDid you see it yourselves?â he
 21844	inquired.
 21845	
 21846	âOh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face
 21847	like the light of heaven, and from the blessed Motherâs cheek it drops
 21848	and drops....â
 21849	
 21850	âBut, dear me, that must be a fraud!â said Pierre, naÃ¯vely, who had
 21851	listened attentively to the pilgrim.
 21852	
 21853	âOh, master, what are you saying?â exclaimed the horrified
 21854	PelagÃ©ya, turning to Princess Mary for support.
 21855	
 21856	âThey impose on the people,â he repeated.
 21857	
 21858	âLord Jesus Christ!â exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself.
 21859	âOh, donât speak so, master! There was a general who did not
 21860	believe, and said, âThe monks cheat,â and as soon as heâd said it
 21861	he went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev
 21862	catacombs came to him and said, âBelieve in me and I will make you
 21863	whole.â So he begged: âTake me to her, take me to her.â Itâs the
 21864	real truth Iâm telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite
 21865	blind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and says,
 21866	âMake me whole,â says he, âand Iâll give thee what the Tsar
 21867	bestowed on me.â I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the
 21868	icon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! Itâs a sin
 21869	to speak so. God will punish you,â she said admonishingly, turning to
 21870	Pierre.
 21871	
 21872	âHow did the star get into the icon?â Pierre asked.
 21873	
 21874	âAnd was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?â said
 21875	Prince Andrew, with a smile.
 21876	
 21877	PelagÃ©ya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.
 21878	
 21879	âOh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!â she began,
 21880	her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. âMaster, what have you
 21881	said? God forgive you!â And she crossed herself. âLord forgive him!
 21882	My dear, what does it mean?...â she asked, turning to Princess
 21883	Mary. She got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She
 21884	evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a
 21885	house where such things could be said, and was at the same time sorry to
 21886	have now to forgo the charity of this house.
 21887	
 21888	âNow, why need you do it?â said Princess Mary. âWhy did you come
 21889	to me?...â
 21890	
 21891	âCome, PelagÃ©ya, I was joking,â said Pierre. âPrincesse, ma
 21892	parole, je nâai pas voulu lâoffenser. * I did not mean anything,
 21893	I was only joking,â he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his
 21894	offense. âIt was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking.â
 21895	
 21896	    * âPrincess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.â
 21897	
 21898	
 21899	PelagÃ©ya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierreâs face there was such a
 21900	look of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at
 21901	her and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.
 21902	
 21903	
 21904	
 21905	
 21906	
 21907	CHAPTER XIV
 21908	
 21909	The pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a
 21910	long account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his
 21911	hands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks
 21912	she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking
 21913	some dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with
 21914	the saints. âIâd pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to
 21915	another. Iâd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and
 21916	there was such peace all around, such blessedness, that one donât want
 21917	to come out, even into the light of heaven again.â
 21918	
 21919	Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out
 21920	of the room, and then, leaving âGodâs folkâ to finish their tea,
 21921	Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.
 21922	
 21923	âYou are very kind,â she said to him.
 21924	
 21925	âOh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so
 21926	well and have the greatest respect for them.â
 21927	
 21928	Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.
 21929	
 21930	âI have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a
 21931	brother,â she said. âHow do you find Andrew?â she added hurriedly,
 21932	not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words. âI am very
 21933	anxious about him. His health was better in the winter, but last spring
 21934	his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a
 21935	cure. And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually. He has not a
 21936	character like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows.
 21937	He keeps it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits,
 21938	but that is the effect of your visitâhe is not often like that. If
 21939	you could persuade him to go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet
 21940	regular life is very bad for him. Others donât notice it, but I see
 21941	it.â
 21942	
 21943	Toward ten oâclock the men servants rushed to the front door, hearing
 21944	the bells of the old princeâs carriage approaching. Prince Andrew and
 21945	Pierre also went out into the porch.
 21946	
 21947	âWhoâs that?â asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out
 21948	of the carriage.
 21949	
 21950	âAh! Very glad! Kiss me,â he said, having learned who the young
 21951	stranger was.
 21952	
 21953	The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.
 21954	
 21955	Before supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his fatherâs study, found
 21956	him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time
 21957	would come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it
 21958	chaffingly, but without getting angry.
 21959	
 21960	âDrain the blood from menâs veins and put in water instead, then
 21961	there will be no more war! Old womenâs nonsenseâold womenâs
 21962	nonsense!â he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately
 21963	on the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew,
 21964	evidently not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over the
 21965	papers his father had brought from town. The old prince went up to him
 21966	and began to talk business.
 21967	
 21968	âThe marshal, a Count RostÃ³v, hasnât sent half his contingent. He
 21969	came to town and wanted to invite me to dinnerâI gave him a pretty
 21970	dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,â the old prince
 21971	went on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. âA
 21972	fine fellowâyour friendâI like him! He stirs me up. Another says
 21973	clever things and one doesnât care to listen, but this one talks
 21974	rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps Iâll
 21975	come and sit with you at supper. Weâll have another dispute. Make
 21976	friends with my little fool, Princess Mary,â he shouted after Pierre,
 21977	through the door.
 21978	
 21979	Only now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the
 21980	strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm was
 21981	not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family
 21982	and with the household. With the stern old prince and the gentle, timid
 21983	Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once felt
 21984	like an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess
 21985	Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her
 21986	most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old âPrince Nicholasâ (as
 21987	his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken
 21988	in his arms, and Michael IvÃ¡novich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at
 21989	him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.
 21990	
 21991	The old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierreâs
 21992	account. And during the two days of the young manâs visit he was
 21993	extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.
 21994	
 21995	When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they
 21996	began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new
 21997	acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but
 21998	what was good of him.
 21999	
 22000	
 22001	
 22002	
 22003	
 22004	CHAPTER XV
 22005	
 22006	When returning from his leave, RostÃ³v felt, for the first time, how
 22007	close was the bond that united him to DenÃ­sov and the whole regiment.
 22008	
 22009	On approaching it, RostÃ³v felt as he had done when approaching his home
 22010	in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform
 22011	of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired DemÃ©ntyev and saw the
 22012	picket ropes of the roan horses, when LavrÃºshka gleefully shouted to
 22013	his master, âThe count has come!â and DenÃ­sov, who had been asleep
 22014	on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him,
 22015	and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, RostÃ³v
 22016	experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his
 22017	sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could
 22018	not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and
 22019	precious as his parentsâ house.
 22020	
 22021	When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had
 22022	been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone
 22023	out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests
 22024	of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one
 22025	narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of
 22026	moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own
 22027	place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of
 22028	all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right
 22029	place and took mistaken decisions; here was no SÃ³nya with whom he
 22030	ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of
 22031	going there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours
 22032	in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not
 22033	that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or
 22034	farther from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and
 22035	undefined money relations with his father, and nothing to recall that
 22036	terrible loss to DÃ³lokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and
 22037	simple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our
 22038	PÃ¡vlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no
 22039	concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was
 22040	lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most
 22041	of all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, oneâs
 22042	pay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide,
 22043	you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the PÃ¡vlograd
 22044	regiment and, when given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly,
 22045	and definitely orderedâand all would be well.
 22046	
 22047	Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental
 22048	life, RostÃ³v felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to
 22049	rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter
 22050	for him, because, after his loss to DÃ³lokhov (for which, in spite
 22051	of all his familyâs efforts to console him, he could not forgive
 22052	himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving,
 22053	not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly
 22054	first-rate comrade and officerâin a word, a splendid man altogether, a
 22055	thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the
 22056	regiment.
 22057	
 22058	After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents
 22059	in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved
 22060	to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
 22061	parents.
 22062	
 22063	Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at PultÃºsk
 22064	and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting
 22065	the Emperorâs arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.
 22066	
 22067	The PÃ¡vlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had
 22068	served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in
 22069	Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the
 22070	campaign. It had been neither at PultÃºsk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and,
 22071	when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign,
 22072	was attached to PlÃ¡tovâs division.
 22073	
 22074	PlÃ¡tovâs division was acting independently of the main army. Several
 22075	times parts of the PÃ¡vlograd regiment had exchanged shots with
 22076	the enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal
 22077	Oudinotâs carriages. In April the PÃ¡vlograds were stationed immovably
 22078	for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.
 22079	
 22080	A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke,
 22081	and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the
 22082	men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could
 22083	arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages,
 22084	searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.
 22085	
 22086	Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledâif any
 22087	remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken
 22088	from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking
 22089	anything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.
 22090	
 22091	The PÃ¡vlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but had
 22092	lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals,
 22093	death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling
 22094	that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able
 22095	to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals.
 22096	When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
 22097	ground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called
 22098	âMÃ¡shkaâs sweet root.â It was very bitter, but they wandered
 22099	about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it,
 22100	though they were ordered not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That
 22101	spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swelling of the
 22102	arms, legs, and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this root.
 22103	But in spite of all this, the soldiers of DenÃ­sovâs squadron fed
 22104	chiefly on âMÃ¡shkaâs sweet root,â because it was the second week
 22105	that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a
 22106	pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.
 22107	
 22108	The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched
 22109	roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of
 22110	felty winter hair.
 22111	
 22112	Despite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just
 22113	as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the
 22114	hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their
 22115	horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in
 22116	place of fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which
 22117	they rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As
 22118	usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before
 22119	them naked; smoked, picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told
 22120	and listened to stories of PotÃ«mkinâs and SuvÃ³rovâs campaigns, or
 22121	to legends of AlÃ«sha the Sly, or the priestâs laborer MikÃ³lka.
 22122	
 22123	The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,
 22124	half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and,
 22125	in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as
 22126	before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was
 22127	no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles.
 22128	The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because
 22129	nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague
 22130	feeling that in the main it was going badly.
 22131	
 22132	RostÃ³v lived, as before, with DenÃ­sov, and since their furlough they
 22133	had become more friendly than ever. DenÃ­sov never spoke of RostÃ³vâs
 22134	family, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, RostÃ³v
 22135	felt that the elder hussarâs luckless love for NatÃ¡sha played a part
 22136	in strengthening their friendship. DenÃ­sov evidently tried to expose
 22137	RostÃ³v to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his
 22138	safe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in
 22139	a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of
 22140	provisions, RostÃ³v found a family consisting of an old Pole and his
 22141	daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak
 22142	to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. RostÃ³v
 22143	brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and
 22144	kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his
 22145	comrades, talking of women, began chaffing RostÃ³v, saying that he was
 22146	more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he
 22147	introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved. RostÃ³v took
 22148	the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the
 22149	officer that it was all DenÃ­sov could do to prevent a duel. When
 22150	the officer had gone away, DenÃ­sov, who did not himself know what
 22151	RostÃ³vâs relations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid
 22152	him for his quickness of temper, and RostÃ³v replied:
 22153	
 22154	âSay what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I canât tell
 22155	you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....â
 22156	
 22157	DenÃ­sov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
 22158	without looking at RostÃ³v, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.
 22159	
 22160	âAh, what a mad bweed you WostÃ³vs are!â he muttered, and RostÃ³v
 22161	noticed tears in his eyes.
 22162	
 22163	
 22164	
 22165	
 22166	
 22167	CHAPTER XVI
 22168	
 22169	In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperorâs arrival,
 22170	but RostÃ³v had no chance of being present at the review he held at
 22171	Bartenstein, as the PÃ¡vlograds were at the outposts far beyond that
 22172	place.
 22173	
 22174	They were bivouacking. DenÃ­sov and RostÃ³v were living in an earth hut,
 22175	dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The
 22176	hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A
 22177	trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep,
 22178	and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and
 22179	these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room,
 22180	in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board,
 22181	lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On
 22182	each side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two
 22183	and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof
 22184	was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench
 22185	and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table.
 22186	DenÃ­sov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his
 22187	squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end,
 22188	with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window. When it
 22189	was very cold, embers from the soldiersâ campfire were placed on
 22190	a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the âreception roomââas
 22191	DenÃ­sov called that part of the hutâand it was then so warm that the
 22192	officers, of whom there were always some with DenÃ­sov and RostÃ³v, sat
 22193	in their shirt sleeves.
 22194	
 22195	In April, RostÃ³v was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and
 22196	eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed
 22197	his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm,
 22198	then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and,
 22199	his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his
 22200	shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his head. He was
 22201	pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days
 22202	for his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting DenÃ­sov, who
 22203	had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.
 22204	
 22205	Suddenly he heard DenÃ­sov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut,
 22206	evidently much excited. RostÃ³v moved to the window to see whom he was
 22207	speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, TopchÃ©enko.
 22208	
 22209	âI ordered you not to let them eat that MÃ¡shka woot stuff!â
 22210	DenÃ­sov was shouting. âAnd I saw with my own eyes how LazarchÃºk
 22211	bwought some fwom the fields.â
 22212	
 22213	âI have given the order again and again, your honor, but they donât
 22214	obey,â answered the quartermaster.
 22215	
 22216	RostÃ³v lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: âLet
 22217	him fuss and bustle now, my jobâs done and Iâm lying
 22218	downâcapitally!â He could hear that LavrÃºshkaâthat sly, bold
 22219	orderly of DenÃ­sovâsâwas talking, as well as the quartermaster.
 22220	LavrÃºshka was saying something about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen
 22221	he had seen when he had gone out for provisions.
 22222	
 22223	Then DenÃ­sovâs voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.
 22224	âSaddle! Second platoon!â
 22225	
 22226	âWhere are they off to now?â thought RostÃ³v.
 22227	
 22228	Five minutes later, DenÃ­sov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots
 22229	on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took
 22230	his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to
 22231	RostÃ³vâs inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly
 22232	that he had some business.
 22233	
 22234	âLet God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!â said DenÃ­sov
 22235	going out, and RostÃ³v heard the hoofs of several horses splashing
 22236	through the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where DenÃ­sov had
 22237	gone. Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave
 22238	the hut till toward evening. DenÃ­sov had not yet returned. The weather
 22239	had cleared up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were
 22240	playing svÃ¡yka, laughing as they threw their missiles which buried
 22241	themselves in the soft mud. RostÃ³v joined them. In the middle of the
 22242	game, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on
 22243	their skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew
 22244	up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.
 22245	
 22246	âThere now, DenÃ­sov has been worrying,â said RostÃ³v, âand here
 22247	are the provisions.â
 22248	
 22249	âSo they are!â said the officers. âWonât the soldiers be
 22250	glad!â
 22251	
 22252	A little behind the hussars came DenÃ­sov, accompanied by two infantry
 22253	officers with whom he was talking.
 22254	
 22255	RostÃ³v went to meet them.
 22256	
 22257	âI warn you, Captain,â one of the officers, a short thin man,
 22258	evidently very angry, was saying.
 22259	
 22260	âHavenât I told you I wonât give them up?â replied DenÃ­sov.
 22261	
 22262	âYou will answer for it, Captain. It is mutinyâseizing the transport
 22263	of oneâs own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.â
 22264	
 22265	âAnd mine have had nothing for two weeks,â said DenÃ­sov.
 22266	
 22267	âIt is robbery! Youâll answer for it, sir!â said the infantry
 22268	officer, raising his voice.
 22269	
 22270	âNow, what are you pestewing me for?â cried DenÃ­sov, suddenly
 22271	losing his temper. âI shall answer for it and not you, and youâd
 22272	better not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!â he shouted
 22273	at the officers.
 22274	
 22275	âVery well, then!â shouted the little officer, undaunted and not
 22276	riding away. âIf you are determined to rob, Iâll...â
 22277	
 22278	âGo to the devil! quick maâch, while youâre safe and sound!â and
 22279	DenÃ­sov turned his horse on the officer.
 22280	
 22281	âVery well, very well!â muttered the officer, threateningly, and
 22282	turning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.
 22283	
 22284	âA dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!â shouted
 22285	DenÃ­sov after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can
 22286	address to a mounted infantryman) and riding up to RostÃ³v, he burst out
 22287	laughing.
 22288	
 22289	âIâve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!â he said.
 22290	âAfter all, canât let our men starve.â
 22291	
 22292	The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
 22293	infantry regiment, but learning from LavrÃºshka that the transport
 22294	was unescorted, DenÃ­sov with his hussars had seized it by force. The
 22295	soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared
 22296	them with the other squadrons.
 22297	
 22298	The next day the regimental commander sent for DenÃ­sov, and holding his
 22299	fingers spread out before his eyes said:
 22300	
 22301	âThis is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and
 22302	wonât begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff
 22303	and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if
 22304	possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as
 22305	the demand was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row
 22306	and the affair may end badly.â
 22307	
 22308	From the regimental commanderâs, DenÃ­sov rode straight to the staff
 22309	with a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came
 22310	back to his dugout in a state such as RostÃ³v had never yet seen him in.
 22311	DenÃ­sov could not speak and gasped for breath. When RostÃ³v asked what
 22312	was the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a
 22313	hoarse, feeble voice.
 22314	
 22315	Alarmed at DenÃ­sovâs condition, RostÃ³v suggested that he should
 22316	undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.
 22317	
 22318	âTwy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but
 22319	Iâll always thwash scoundwels... and Iâll tell the Empewoâ...
 22320	Ice...â he muttered.
 22321	
 22322	The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary
 22323	to bleed DenÃ­sov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy
 22324	arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him.
 22325	
 22326	âI get there,â began DenÃ­sov. ââNow then, whereâs your
 22327	chiefâs quarters?â They were pointed out. âPlease to wait.â
 22328	âIâve widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time
 22329	to wait. Announce me.â Vewy well, so out comes their head
 22330	chiefâalso took it into his head to lecture me: âItâs
 22331	wobbewy!âââWobbewy,â I say, âis not done by man who seizes
 22332	pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his
 22333	own pockets!â âWill you please be silent?â âVewy good!â Then
 22334	he says: âGo and give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair
 22335	will be passed on to headquarters.â I go to the commissioner. I enter,
 22336	and at the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it
 22337	thatâs starving us?â shouted DenÃ­sov, hitting the table with the
 22338	fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down
 22339	and the tumblers on it jumped about. âTelyÃ¡nin! âWhat? So itâs
 22340	you whoâs starving us to death! Is it? Take this and this!â and I
 22341	hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... âAh, what a... what a...!â
 22342	and I staâted fwashing him... Well, Iâve had a bit of fun I can tell
 22343	you!â cried DenÃ­sov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing
 22344	under his black mustache. âIâd have killed him if they hadnât
 22345	taken him away!â
 22346	
 22347	âBut what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,â said RostÃ³v.
 22348	âYouâve set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up
 22349	again.â
 22350	
 22351	DenÃ­sov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and
 22352	cheerful.
 22353	
 22354	But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into RostÃ³vâs and
 22355	DenÃ­sovâs dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed
 22356	them a paper addressed to Major DenÃ­sov from the regimental commander
 22357	in which inquiries were made about yesterdayâs occurrence. The
 22358	adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad
 22359	turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the
 22360	severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded,
 22361	degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.
 22362	
 22363	The case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after
 22364	seizing the transports, Major DenÃ­sov, being drunk, went to the chief
 22365	quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened
 22366	to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given
 22367	two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.
 22368	
 22369	In answer to RostÃ³vâs renewed questions, DenÃ­sov said, laughing,
 22370	that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up
 22371	in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the
 22372	least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack
 22373	him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.
 22374	
 22375	DenÃ­sov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but RostÃ³v knew him
 22376	too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart
 22377	he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was
 22378	evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices
 22379	from the court arrived, and on the first of May, DenÃ­sov was ordered
 22380	to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
 22381	the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
 22382	office. On the previous day PlÃ¡tov reconnoitered with two Cossack
 22383	regiments and two squadrons of hussars. DenÃ­sov, as was his wont, rode
 22384	out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet fired by
 22385	a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at
 22386	another time DenÃ­sov would not have left the regiment for so slight a
 22387	wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing
 22388	at the staff and went into hospital.

 22394	CHAPTER XVII
 22395	
 22396	In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the PÃ¡vlograds did
 22397	not take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. RostÃ³v, who
 22398	felt his friendâs absence very much, having no news of him since he
 22399	left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his
 22400	affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit DenÃ­sov
 22401	in hospital.
 22402	
 22403	The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated
 22404	by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so
 22405	beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly
 22406	dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets,
 22407	tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.
 22408	
 22409	The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and
 22410	panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence
 22411	that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale
 22412	swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the
 22413	yard.
 22414	
 22415	Directly RostÃ³v entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
 22416	putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army
 22417	doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.
 22418	
 22419	âI canât tear myself to pieces,â the doctor was saying. âCome to
 22420	MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich in the evening. I shall be there.â
 22421	
 22422	The assistant asked some further questions.
 22423	
 22424	âOh, do the best you can! Isnât it all the same?â The doctor
 22425	noticed RostÃ³v coming upstairs.
 22426	
 22427	âWhat do you want, sir?â said the doctor. âWhat do you want?
 22428	The bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a
 22429	pesthouse, sir.â
 22430	
 22431	âHow so?â asked RostÃ³v.
 22432	
 22433	âTyphus, sir. Itâs death to go in. Only we two, MakÃ©ev and Iâ (he
 22434	pointed to the assistant), âkeep on here. Some five of us doctors have
 22435	died in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,â
 22436	said the doctor with evident satisfaction. âPrussian doctors have been
 22437	invited here, but our allies donât like it at all.â
 22438	
 22439	RostÃ³v explained that he wanted to see Major DenÃ­sov of the hussars,
 22440	who was wounded.
 22441	
 22442	âI donât know. I canât tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in
 22443	charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! Itâs
 22444	well that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee
 22445	and some lint each month or we should be lost!â he laughed. âFour
 22446	hundred, sir, and theyâre always sending me fresh ones. There are four
 22447	hundred? Eh?â he asked, turning to the assistant.
 22448	
 22449	The assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and impatient
 22450	for the talkative doctor to go.
 22451	
 22452	âMajor DenÃ­sov,â RostÃ³v said again. âHe was wounded at
 22453	Molliten.â
 22454	
 22455	âDead, I fancy. Eh, MakÃ©ev?â queried the doctor, in a tone of
 22456	indifference.
 22457	
 22458	The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctorâs words.
 22459	
 22460	âIs he tall and with reddish hair?â asked the doctor.
 22461	
 22462	RostÃ³v described DenÃ­sovâs appearance.
 22463	
 22464	âThere was one like that,â said the doctor, as if pleased. âThat
 22465	one is dead, I fancy. However, Iâll look up our list. We had a list.
 22466	Have you got it, MakÃ©ev?â
 22467	
 22468	âMakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich has the list,â answered the assistant. âBut if
 22469	youâll step into the officersâ wards youâll see for yourself,â
 22470	he added, turning to RostÃ³v.
 22471	
 22472	âAh, youâd better not go, sir,â said the doctor, âor you may
 22473	have to stay here yourself.â
 22474	
 22475	But RostÃ³v bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant
 22476	to show him the way.
 22477	
 22478	âOnly donât blame me!â the doctor shouted up after him.
 22479	
 22480	RostÃ³v and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell was so
 22481	strong there that RostÃ³v held his nose and had to pause and collect
 22482	his strength before he could go on. A door opened to the right, and an
 22483	emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, limped
 22484	out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked with glittering envious
 22485	eyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at the door, RostÃ³v
 22486	saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and
 22487	overcoats.
 22488	
 22489	âMay I go in and look?â
 22490	
 22491	âWhat is there to see?â said the assistant.
 22492	
 22493	But, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in,
 22494	RostÃ³v entered the soldiersâ ward. The foul air, to which he had
 22495	already begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It
 22496	was a little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where
 22497	it originated.
 22498	
 22499	In the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows,
 22500	the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and
 22501	leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were unconscious and
 22502	paid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious raised
 22503	themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at
 22504	RostÃ³v with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and
 22505	envy of anotherâs health. RostÃ³v went to the middle of the room and
 22506	looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same
 22507	thing there. He stood still, looking silently around. He had not at all
 22508	expected such a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the
 22509	passage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge
 22510	by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs
 22511	outstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled back so that
 22512	only the whites were seen, and on his bare legs and arms which were
 22513	still red, the veins stood out like cords. He was knocking the back of
 22514	his head against the floor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept
 22515	repeating. RostÃ³v listened and made out the word. It was âdrink,
 22516	drink, a drink!â RostÃ³v glanced round, looking for someone who would
 22517	put this man back in his place and bring him water.
 22518	
 22519	âWho looks after the sick here?â he asked the assistant.
 22520	
 22521	Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the
 22522	next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of RostÃ³v.
 22523	
 22524	âGood day, your honor!â he shouted, rolling his eyes at RostÃ³v and
 22525	evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.
 22526	
 22527	âGet him to his place and give him some water,â said RostÃ³v,
 22528	pointing to the Cossack.
 22529	
 22530	âYes, your honor,â the soldier replied complacently, and rolling
 22531	his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not
 22532	move.
 22533	
 22534	âNo, itâs impossible to do anything here,â thought RostÃ³v,
 22535	lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense
 22536	look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on
 22537	an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a
 22538	skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on RostÃ³v.
 22539	The manâs neighbor on one side whispered something to him, pointing
 22540	at RostÃ³v, who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew
 22541	nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the
 22542	other had been amputated above the knee. His neighbor on the other side,
 22543	who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back, was
 22544	a young soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled
 22545	and his eyes were rolled back. RostÃ³v looked at the young soldier and a
 22546	cold chill ran down his back.
 22547	
 22548	âWhy, this one seems...â he began, turning to the assistant.
 22549	
 22550	âAnd how weâve been begging, your honor,â said the old soldier,
 22551	his jaw quivering. âHeâs been dead since morning. After all weâre
 22552	men, not dogs.â
 22553	
 22554	âIâll send someone at once. He shall be taken awayâtaken away at
 22555	once,â said the assistant hurriedly. âLet us go, your honor.â
 22556	
 22557	âYes, yes, let us go,â said RostÃ³v hastily, and lowering his
 22558	eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of
 22559	reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the
 22560	room.
 22561	
 22562	
 22563	
 22564	
 22565	
 22566	CHAPTER XVIII
 22567	
 22568	Going along the corridor, the assistant led RostÃ³v to the officersâ
 22569	wards, consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood open. There
 22570	were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or
 22571	sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing
 22572	gowns. The first person RostÃ³v met in the officersâ ward was a thin
 22573	little man with one arm, who was walking about the first room in a
 22574	nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth.
 22575	RostÃ³v looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.
 22576	
 22577	âSee where weâve met again!â said the little man. âTÃºshin,
 22578	TÃºshin, donât you remember, who gave you a lift at SchÃ¶n Grabern?
 22579	And Iâve had a bit cut off, you see...â he went on with a smile,
 22580	pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown. âLooking for
 22581	VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich DenÃ­sov? My neighbor,â he added, when he heard
 22582	who RostÃ³v wanted. âHere, here,â and TÃºshin led him into the next
 22583	room, from whence came sounds of several laughing voices.
 22584	
 22585	âHow can they laugh, or even live at all here?â thought RostÃ³v,
 22586	still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong
 22587	in the soldiersâ ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those
 22588	envious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face
 22589	of that young soldier with eyes rolled back.
 22590	
 22591	DenÃ­sov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though
 22592	it was nearly noon.
 22593	
 22594	âAh, WostÃ³v? How are you, how are you?â he called out, still in the
 22595	same voice as in the regiment, but RostÃ³v noticed sadly that under this
 22596	habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed
 22597	itself in the expression of DenÃ­sovâs face and the intonations of his
 22598	voice.
 22599	
 22600	His wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks
 22601	after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces
 22602	of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck RostÃ³v.
 22603	What struck him was that DenÃ­sov did not seem glad to see him, and
 22604	smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about
 22605	the general state of affairs, and when RostÃ³v spoke of these matters
 22606	did not listen.
 22607	
 22608	RostÃ³v even noticed that DenÃ­sov did not like to be reminded of the
 22609	regiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on
 22610	outside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and
 22611	was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On
 22612	RostÃ³vâs inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from
 22613	under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
 22614	rough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began
 22615	reading his paper and specially drew RostÃ³vâs attention to the
 22616	stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions,
 22617	who had gathered round RostÃ³vâa fresh arrival from the world
 22618	outsideâgradually began to disperse as soon as DenÃ­sov began reading
 22619	his answer. RostÃ³v noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had
 22620	already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the
 22621	man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed,
 22622	gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed TÃºshin still
 22623	listened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading,
 22624	the Uhlan interrupted DenÃ­sov.
 22625	
 22626	âBut what I say is,â he said, turning to RostÃ³v, âit would be
 22627	best simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards
 22628	will now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....â
 22629	
 22630	âMe petition the Empewoâ!â exclaimed DenÃ­sov, in a voice to which
 22631	he tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like
 22632	an expression of irritable impotence. âWhat for? If I were a wobber I
 22633	would ask mercy, but Iâm being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers
 22634	to book. Let them twy me, Iâm not afwaid of anyone. Iâve served
 22635	the Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be
 22636	degwaded?... Listen, Iâm wâiting to them stwaight. This is what I
 22637	say: âIf I had wobbed the Tweasuwy...ââ
 22638	
 22639	âItâs certainly well written,â said TÃºshin, âbut thatâs not
 22640	the point, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich,â and he also turned to RostÃ³v. âOne
 22641	has to submit, and VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich doesnât want to. You know the
 22642	auditor told you it was a bad business.â
 22643	
 22644	âWell, let it be bad,â said DenÃ­sov.
 22645	
 22646	âThe auditor wrote out a petition for you,â continued TÃºshin,
 22647	âand you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt
 22648	heâ (indicating RostÃ³v) âhas connections on the staff. You wonât
 22649	find a better opportunity.â
 22650	
 22651	âHavenât I said Iâm not going to gwovel?â DenÃ­sov interrupted
 22652	him, went on reading his paper.
 22653	
 22654	RostÃ³v had not the courage to persuade DenÃ­sov, though he
 22655	instinctively felt that the way advised by TÃºshin and the other
 22656	officers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of
 22657	service to DenÃ­sov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty
 22658	temper.
 22659	
 22660	When the reading of DenÃ­sovâs virulent reply, which took more than an
 22661	hour, was over, RostÃ³v said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day
 22662	in a most dejected state of mind amid DenÃ­sovâs hospital comrades,
 22663	who had gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to
 22664	their stories. DenÃ­sov was moodily silent all the evening.
 22665	
 22666	Late in the evening, when RostÃ³v was about to leave, he asked DenÃ­sov
 22667	whether he had no commission for him.
 22668	
 22669	âYes, wait a bit,â said DenÃ­sov, glancing round at the officers,
 22670	and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where
 22671	he had an inkpot, and sat down to write.
 22672	
 22673	âIt seems itâs no use knocking oneâs head against a wall!â he
 22674	said, coming from the window and giving RostÃ³v a large envelope. In
 22675	it was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in
 22676	which DenÃ­sov, without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat
 22677	officials, simply asked for pardon.
 22678	
 22679	âHand it in. It seems...â
 22680	
 22681	He did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.
 22682	
 22683	
 22684	
 22685	
 22686	
 22687	CHAPTER XIX
 22688	
 22689	Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of
 22690	DenÃ­sovâs affairs, RostÃ³v rode to Tilsit with the letter to the
 22691	Emperor.
 22692	
 22693	On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in
 22694	Tilsit. BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y had asked the important personage on whom he
 22695	was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at
 22696	Tilsit.
 22697	
 22698	âI should like to see the great man,â he said, alluding to Napoleon,
 22699	whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.
 22700	
 22701	âYou are speaking of Buonaparte?â asked the general, smiling.
 22702	
 22703	BorÃ­s looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
 22704	being tested.
 22705	
 22706	âI am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,â he replied. The
 22707	general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.
 22708	
 22709	âYou will go far,â he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.
 22710	
 22711	BorÃ­s was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two
 22712	Emperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon
 22713	pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the
 22714	pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern
 22715	on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleonâs arrival, saw both
 22716	Emperors get into boats, and saw how Napoleonâreaching the raft
 22717	firstâstepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand
 22718	to him, and how they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun
 22719	to move in the highest circles BorÃ­s had made it his habit to watch
 22720	attentively all that went on around him and to note it down. At the time
 22721	of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with
 22722	Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to
 22723	words spoken by important personages. At the moment the Emperors went
 22724	into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not forget to look at
 22725	it again when Alexander came out. The interview had lasted an hour and
 22726	fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same evening, among other
 22727	facts he felt to be of historic importance. As the Emperorâs suite
 22728	was a very small one, it was a matter of great importance, for a man who
 22729	valued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the occasion of
 22730	this interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this,
 22731	BorÃ­s felt that henceforth his position was fully assured. He had not
 22732	only become known, but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted
 22733	him. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so
 22734	that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from
 22735	cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer,
 22736	would now have been surprised had he been absent.
 22737	
 22738	BorÃ­s lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count ZhilÃ­nski.
 22739	ZhilÃ­nski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately
 22740	fond of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French
 22741	officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and
 22742	lunching with him and BorÃ­s.
 22743	
 22744	On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count ZhilÃ­nski arranged a
 22745	supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of
 22746	Napoleonâs, there were also several French officers of the Guard,
 22747	and a page of Napoleonâs, a young lad of an old aristocratic French
 22748	family. That same day, RostÃ³v, profiting by the darkness to avoid being
 22749	recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging
 22750	occupied by BorÃ­s and ZhilÃ­nski.
 22751	
 22752	RostÃ³v, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far
 22753	from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the
 22754	Frenchâwho from being foes had suddenly become friendsâthat had
 22755	taken place at headquarters and in BorÃ­s. In the army, Bonaparte and
 22756	the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt,
 22757	and fear. Only recently, talking with one of PlÃ¡tovâs Cossack
 22758	officers, RostÃ³v had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he
 22759	would be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately,
 22760	happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road, RostÃ³v had
 22761	maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate
 22762	sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. RostÃ³v was therefore unpleasantly
 22763	struck by the presence of French officers in BorÃ­sâ lodging, dressed
 22764	in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point
 22765	of view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French
 22766	officer, who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of
 22767	hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly
 22768	seized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether
 22769	DrubetskÃ³y lived there. BorÃ­s, hearing a strange voice in the
 22770	anteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance showed itself
 22771	for a moment on his face on first recognizing RostÃ³v.
 22772	
 22773	âAh, itâs you? Very glad, very glad to see you,â he said, however,
 22774	coming toward him with a smile. But RostÃ³v had noticed his first
 22775	impulse.
 22776	
 22777	âIâve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have
 22778	business,â he said coldly.
 22779	
 22780	âNo, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment.
 22781	Dans un moment je suis Ã  vous,â * he said, answering someone who
 22782	called him.
 22783	
 22784	    * âIn a minute I shall be at your disposal.â
 22785	
 22786	
 22787	âI see Iâm intruding,â RostÃ³v repeated.
 22788	
 22789	The look of annoyance had already disappeared from BorÃ­sâ face:
 22790	having evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took
 22791	both RostÃ³vâs hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking
 22792	serenely and steadily at RostÃ³v, seemed to be veiled by something,
 22793	as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to
 22794	RostÃ³v.
 22795	
 22796	âOh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!â said BorÃ­s,
 22797	and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and
 22798	introduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but
 22799	an hussar officer, and an old friend of his.
 22800	
 22801	âCount ZhilÃ­nskiâle Comte N. N.âle Capitaine S. S.,â said he,
 22802	naming his guests. RostÃ³v looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed
 22803	reluctantly, and remained silent.
 22804	
 22805	ZhilÃ­nski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very
 22806	willingly into his circle and did not speak to RostÃ³v. BorÃ­s did not
 22807	appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same
 22808	pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which
 22809	he had met RostÃ³v, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the
 22810	Frenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen,
 22811	addressed the obstinately taciturn RostÃ³v, saying that the latter had
 22812	probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.
 22813	
 22814	âNo, I came on business,â replied RostÃ³v, briefly.
 22815	
 22816	RostÃ³v had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of
 22817	dissatisfaction on BorÃ­sâ face, and as always happens to those in a
 22818	bad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion
 22819	and that he was in everybodyâs way. He really was in their way, for he
 22820	alone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The
 22821	looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: âAnd what is he sitting
 22822	here for?â He rose and went up to BorÃ­s.
 22823	
 22824	âAnyhow, Iâm in your way,â he said in a low tone. âCome and talk
 22825	over my business and Iâll go away.â
 22826	
 22827	âOh, no, not at all,â said BorÃ­s. âBut if you are tired, come and
 22828	lie down in my room and have a rest.â
 22829	
 22830	âYes, really...â
 22831	
 22832	They went into the little room where BorÃ­s slept. RostÃ³v, without
 22833	sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if BorÃ­s were to blame in
 22834	some way) telling him about DenÃ­sovâs affair, asking him whether,
 22835	through his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on
 22836	DenÃ­sovâs behalf and get DenÃ­sovâs petition handed in. When he
 22837	and BorÃ­s were alone, RostÃ³v felt for the first time that he could not
 22838	look BorÃ­s in the face without a sense of awkwardness. BorÃ­s, with one
 22839	leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender
 22840	fingers of his right, listened to RostÃ³v as a general listens to the
 22841	report of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight into
 22842	RostÃ³vâs eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened
 22843	RostÃ³v felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.
 22844	
 22845	âI have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe
 22846	in such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the
 22847	Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general,
 22848	I think...â
 22849	
 22850	âSo you donât want to do anything? Well then, say so!â RostÃ³v
 22851	almost shouted, not looking BorÃ­s in the face.
 22852	
 22853	BorÃ­s smiled.
 22854	
 22855	âOn the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...â
 22856	
 22857	At that moment ZhilÃ­nskiâs voice was heard calling BorÃ­s.
 22858	
 22859	âWell then, go, go, go...â said RostÃ³v, and refusing supper and
 22860	remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long
 22861	time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.
 22862	
 22863	
 22864	
 22865	
 22866	
 22867	CHAPTER XX
 22868	
 22869	RostÃ³v had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition
 22870	on DenÃ­sovâs behalf. He could not himself go to the general in
 22871	attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission
 22872	to do so, and BorÃ­s, even had he wished to, could not have done so on
 22873	the following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were
 22874	signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross
 22875	of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the
 22876	First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening, given by
 22877	a battalion of the French Guards to the PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion. The
 22878	Emperors were to be present at that banquet.
 22879	
 22880	RostÃ³v felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with BorÃ­s that, when the
 22881	latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next
 22882	morning went away, avoiding BorÃ­s. In his civilian clothes and a
 22883	round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the French and their
 22884	uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French
 22885	Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and
 22886	preparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors
 22887	draped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In
 22888	the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.
 22889	
 22890	âBorÃ­s doesnât want to help me and I donât want to ask him.
 22891	Thatâs settled,â thought Nicholas. âAll is over between us, but
 22892	I wonât leave here without having done all I can for DenÃ­sov and
 22893	certainly not without getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!...
 22894	He is here!â thought RostÃ³v, who had unconsciously returned to the
 22895	house where Alexander lodged.
 22896	
 22897	Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
 22898	assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.
 22899	
 22900	âI may see him at any moment,â thought RostÃ³v. âIf only I were
 22901	to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really
 22902	arrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on
 22903	whose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows everything.
 22904	Who can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even if they did
 22905	arrest me for being here, what would it matter?â thought he, looking
 22906	at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor occupied. âAfter
 22907	all, people do go in.... Itâs all nonsense! Iâll go in and hand
 22908	the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for DrubetskÃ³y who
 22909	drives me to it!â And suddenly with a determination he himself did not
 22910	expect, RostÃ³v felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to
 22911	the house.
 22912	
 22913	âNo, I wonât miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,â
 22914	he thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of
 22915	the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. âI will fall at
 22916	his feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even
 22917	thank me. âI am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is
 22918	the greatest happiness,ââ RostÃ³v fancied the sovereign saying. And
 22919	passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch
 22920	of the Emperorâs house.
 22921	
 22922	A broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he
 22923	saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the
 22924	lower floor.
 22925	
 22926	âWhom do you want?â someone inquired.
 22927	
 22928	âTo hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,â said Nicholas,
 22929	with a tremor in his voice.
 22930	
 22931	âA petition? This way, to the officer on dutyâ (he was shown the
 22932	door leading downstairs), âonly it wonât be accepted.â
 22933	
 22934	On hearing this indifferent voice, RostÃ³v grew frightened at what
 22935	he was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so
 22936	fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away,
 22937	but the official who had questioned him opened the door, and RostÃ³v
 22938	entered.
 22939	
 22940	A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and
 22941	a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that
 22942	room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a
 22943	new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason,
 22944	attracted RostÃ³vâs attention. This man was speaking to someone in the
 22945	adjoining room.
 22946	
 22947	âA good figure and in her first bloom,â he was saying, but on seeing
 22948	RostÃ³v, he stopped short and frowned.
 22949	
 22950	âWhat is it? A petition?â
 22951	
 22952	âWhat is it?â asked the person in the other room.
 22953	
 22954	âAnother petitioner,â answered the man with the braces.
 22955	
 22956	âTell him to come later. Heâll be coming out directly, we must
 22957	go.â
 22958	
 22959	âLater... later! Tomorrow. Itâs too late...â
 22960	
 22961	RostÃ³v turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped
 22962	him.
 22963	
 22964	âWhom have you come from? Who are you?â
 22965	
 22966	âI come from Major DenÃ­sov,â answered RostÃ³v.
 22967	
 22968	âAre you an officer?â
 22969	
 22970	âLieutenant Count RostÃ³v.â
 22971	
 22972	âWhat audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with
 22973	you... go,â and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed
 22974	him.
 22975	
 22976	RostÃ³v went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were
 22977	many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.
 22978	
 22979	Cursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding
 22980	himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to
 22981	shame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety
 22982	of his conduct and repenting of it, RostÃ³v, with downcast eyes, was
 22983	making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
 22984	familiar voice called him and a hand detained him.
 22985	
 22986	âWhat are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?â asked a deep
 22987	voice.
 22988	
 22989	It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperorâs special favor
 22990	during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in
 22991	which RostÃ³v was serving.
 22992	
 22993	RostÃ³v, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly,
 22994	jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice
 22995	told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for DenÃ­sov, whom
 22996	the general knew. Having heard RostÃ³v to the end, the general shook his
 22997	head gravely.
 22998	
 22999	âIâm sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.â
 23000	
 23001	Hardly had RostÃ³v handed him the letter and finished explaining
 23002	DenÃ­sovâs case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard
 23003	on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The
 23004	gentlemen of the Emperorâs suite ran down the stairs and went to their
 23005	horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the
 23006	Emperorâs horse, and the faint creak of a footstep RostÃ³v knew at
 23007	once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized,
 23008	RostÃ³v went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive
 23009	civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored:
 23010	that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and
 23011	mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign
 23012	rose again in RostÃ³vâs soul in all its old force. In the uniform of
 23013	the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regimentâwhite chamois-leather breeches and high
 23014	bootsâand wearing a star RostÃ³v did not know (it was that of the
 23015	LÃ©gion dâhonneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on
 23016	his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked
 23017	about him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few
 23018	words to some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of
 23019	RostÃ³vâs division, smiled and beckoned to him.
 23020	
 23021	All the suite drew back and RostÃ³v saw the general talking for some
 23022	time to the Emperor.
 23023	
 23024	The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse.
 23025	Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom
 23026	was RostÃ³v) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse,
 23027	with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general
 23028	and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:
 23029	
 23030	âI cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than
 23031	I,â and he raised his foot to the stirrup.
 23032	
 23033	The general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and
 23034	rode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm,
 23035	RostÃ³v ran after him with the crowd.
 23036	
 23037	
 23038	
 23039	
 23040	
 23041	CHAPTER XXI
 23042	
 23043	The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion
 23044	of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
 23045	French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.
 23046	
 23047	As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented
 23048	arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and
 23049	at the head of them RostÃ³v recognized Napoleon. It could be no one
 23050	else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over
 23051	a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding
 23052	a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered
 23053	saddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did
 23054	so, RostÃ³v, with his cavalrymanâs eye, could not help noticing
 23055	that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions
 23056	shouted âHurrah!â and âVive lâEmpereur!â Napoleon said
 23057	something to Alexander, and both Emperors dismounted and took each
 23058	otherâs hands. Napoleonâs face wore an unpleasant and artificial
 23059	smile. Alexander was saying something affable to him.
 23060	
 23061	In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmesâ horses, which
 23062	were pushing back the crowd, RostÃ³v kept his eyes on every movement
 23063	of Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander
 23064	treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
 23065	the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter
 23066	to him.
 23067	
 23068	Alexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached
 23069	the right flank of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion and came straight up to
 23070	the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close
 23071	to the Emperors that RostÃ³v, standing in the front row, was afraid he
 23072	might be recognized.
 23073	
 23074	âSire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the
 23075	bravest of your soldiers,â said a sharp, precise voice, articulating
 23076	every letter.
 23077	
 23078	This was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into
 23079	Alexanderâs eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to
 23080	him and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.
 23081	
 23082	âTo him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,â added
 23083	Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance
 23084	exasperating to RostÃ³v, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn
 23085	up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
 23086	Emperor.
 23087	
 23088	âWill Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?â said Alexander
 23089	and took a few hasty steps toward Prince KozlÃ³vski, the commander of
 23090	the battalion.
 23091	
 23092	Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,
 23093	tore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him
 23094	rushed forward and picked it up.
 23095	
 23096	âTo whom shall it be given?â the Emperor Alexander asked KozlÃ³vski,
 23097	in Russian in a low voice.
 23098	
 23099	âTo whomever Your Majesty commands.â
 23100	
 23101	The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,
 23102	remarked:
 23103	
 23104	âBut we must give him an answer.â
 23105	
 23106	KozlÃ³vski scanned the ranks resolutely and included RostÃ³v in his
 23107	scrutiny.
 23108	
 23109	âCan it be me?â thought RostÃ³v.
 23110	
 23111	âLÃ¡zarev!â the colonel called, with a frown, and LÃ¡zarev, the
 23112	first soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.
 23113	
 23114	âWhere are you off to? Stop here!â voices whispered to LÃ¡zarev who
 23115	did not know where to go. LÃ¡zarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at
 23116	his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers
 23117	called before the ranks.
 23118	
 23119	Napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out
 23120	behind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing
 23121	at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed
 23122	something from one to another, and a pageâthe same one RostÃ³v
 23123	had seen the previous evening at BorÃ­sââran forward and, bowing
 23124	respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a
 23125	moment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking,
 23126	pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them. Then he
 23127	approached LÃ¡zarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his
 23128	own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what
 23129	he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white
 23130	hand holding the Order touched one of LÃ¡zarevâs buttons. It was as if
 23131	Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch
 23132	that soldierâs breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded,
 23133	and distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid
 23134	the cross on LÃ¡zarevâs breast and, dropping his hand, turned toward
 23135	Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there. And it
 23136	really did.
 23137	
 23138	Officious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and
 23139	fastened it to the uniform. LÃ¡zarev glanced morosely at the little
 23140	man with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing
 23141	motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexanderâs
 23142	eyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do
 23143	something else. But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in
 23144	that rigid position.
 23145	
 23146	The Emperors remounted and rode away. The PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion,
 23147	breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables
 23148	prepared for them.
 23149	
 23150	LÃ¡zarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced
 23151	him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and
 23152	civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French
 23153	voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square.
 23154	Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by
 23155	RostÃ³v.
 23156	
 23157	âWhat dâyou think of the treat? All on silver plate,â one of them
 23158	was saying. âHave you seen LÃ¡zarev?â
 23159	
 23160	âI have.â
 23161	
 23162	âTomorrow, I hear, the PreobrazhÃ©nskis will give them a dinner.â
 23163	
 23164	âYes, but what luck for LÃ¡zarev! Twelve hundred francsâ pension for
 23165	life.â
 23166	
 23167	âHereâs a cap, lads!â shouted a PreobrazhÃ©nsk soldier, donning a
 23168	shaggy French cap.
 23169	
 23170	âItâs a fine thing! First-rate!â
 23171	
 23172	âHave you heard the password?â asked one Guardsâ officer of
 23173	another. âThe day before yesterday it was âNapolÃ©on, France,
 23174	bravoureâ; yesterday, âAlexandre, Russie, grandeur.â One day our
 23175	Emperor gives it and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send
 23176	a St. Georgeâs Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be
 23177	done. He must respond in kind.â
 23178	
 23179	BorÃ­s, too, with his friend ZhilÃ­nski, came to see the PreobrazhÃ©nsk
 23180	banquet. On his way back, he noticed RostÃ³v standing by the corner of a
 23181	house.
 23182	
 23183	âRostÃ³v! How dâyou do? We missed one another,â he said, and could
 23184	not refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and
 23185	troubled was RostÃ³vâs face.
 23186	
 23187	âNothing, nothing,â replied RostÃ³v.
 23188	
 23189	âYouâll call round?â
 23190	
 23191	âYes, I will.â
 23192	
 23193	RostÃ³v stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a
 23194	distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could
 23195	not bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he
 23196	remembered DenÃ­sov with his changed expression, his submission, and the
 23197	whole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So
 23198	vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he
 23199	looked round to see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that
 23200	self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an
 23201	Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then why those severed
 23202	arms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he thought of LÃ¡zarev
 23203	rewarded and DenÃ­sov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself
 23204	harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.
 23205	
 23206	The smell of the food the PreobrazhÃ©nskis were eating and a sense of
 23207	hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to
 23208	eat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.
 23209	There he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself,
 23210	had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a
 23211	dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation
 23212	naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of
 23213	the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
 23214	Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would
 23215	have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition.
 23216	Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a
 23217	couple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on
 23218	tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to
 23219	his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the
 23220	officersâ saying that it was humiliating to look at the French,
 23221	RostÃ³v began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to
 23222	the surprise of the officers:
 23223	
 23224	âHow can you judge whatâs best?â he cried, the blood suddenly
 23225	rushing to his face. âHow can you judge the Emperorâs actions? What
 23226	right have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperorâs aims
 23227	or his actions!â
 23228	
 23229	âBut I never said a word about the Emperor!â said the officer,
 23230	justifying himself, and unable to understand RostÃ³vâs outburst,
 23231	except on the supposition that he was drunk.
 23232	
 23233	But RostÃ³v did not listen to him.
 23234	
 23235	âWe are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,â
 23236	he went on. âIf we are ordered to die, we must die. If weâre
 23237	punished, it means that we have deserved it, itâs not for us to judge.
 23238	If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude
 23239	an alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If
 23240	once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred
 23241	will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no Godânothing!â
 23242	shouted Nicholas, banging the tableâvery little to the point as it
 23243	seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own
 23244	thoughts.
 23245	
 23246	âOur business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! Thatâs
 23247	all....â said he.
 23248	
 23249	âAnd to drink,â said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.
 23250	
 23251	âYes, and to drink,â assented Nicholas. âHullo there! Another
 23252	bottle!â he shouted.
 23253	
 23254	In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with
 23255	the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was
 23256	much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.

 23262	CHAPTER XXII
 23263	
 23264	In 1809 the intimacy between âthe worldâs two arbiters,â as
 23265	Napoleon and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared
 23266	war on Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with
 23267	our old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and
 23268	in court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one
 23269	of Alexanderâs sisters was spoken of. But besides considerations of
 23270	foreign policy, the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly
 23271	directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the
 23272	departments of government.
 23273	
 23274	Life meanwhileâreal life, with its essential interests of health and
 23275	sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought,
 23276	science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passionsâwent on
 23277	as usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
 23278	with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.

 23289	
 23290	CHAPTER I
 23291	
 23292	Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.
 23293	
 23294	All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estatesâand constantly
 23295	changing from one thing to another had never accomplishedâwere carried
 23296	out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty.
 23297	
 23298	He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked,
 23299	and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.
 23300	
 23301	On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
 23302	free agricultural laborersâthis being one of the first examples of
 23303	the kind in Russia. On other estates the serfsâ compulsory labor was
 23304	commuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for BoguchÃ¡rovo
 23305	at his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to
 23306	the children of the peasants and household serfs.
 23307	
 23308	Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his
 23309	son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he spent in
 23310	âBoguchÃ¡rovo Cloister,â as his father called Prince Andrewâs
 23311	estate. Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had
 23312	expressed to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received
 23313	many books, and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had
 23314	visitors from Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged
 23315	behind himselfâwho never left the countryâin knowledge of what was
 23316	happening in home and foreign affairs.
 23317	
 23318	Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of
 23319	books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of
 23320	our last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a
 23321	reform of the army rules and regulations.
 23322	
 23323	In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the RyazÃ¡n estates which had
 23324	been inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.
 23325	
 23326	Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the calÃ¨che looking at the new
 23327	grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white
 23328	spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. He was not thinking of
 23329	anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side.
 23330	
 23331	They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before.
 23332	They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green
 23333	fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge,
 23334	uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of
 23335	stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a
 23336	birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the forest it was
 23337	almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with their sticky green
 23338	leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades
 23339	of green grass were pushing up and lifting last yearâs leaves. The
 23340	coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there
 23341	among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter. On entering the
 23342	forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly.
 23343	
 23344	Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented.
 23345	But apparently the coachmanâs sympathy was not enough for Peter, and
 23346	he turned on the box toward his master.
 23347	
 23348	âHow pleasant it is, your excellency!â he said with a respectful
 23349	smile.
 23350	
 23351	âWhat?â
 23352	
 23353	âItâs pleasant, your excellency!â
 23354	
 23355	âWhat is he talking about?â thought Prince Andrew. âOh, the
 23356	spring, I suppose,â he thought as he turned round. âYes, really
 23357	everything is green already.... How early! The birches and cherry and
 23358	alders too are coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is
 23359	one oak!â
 23360	
 23361	At the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of the
 23362	birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice as
 23363	tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a
 23364	man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been
 23365	broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling
 23366	unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged,
 23367	stern, and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the
 23368	dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak,
 23369	refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
 23370	the sunshine.
 23371	
 23372	âSpring, love, happiness!â this oak seemed to say. âAre you not
 23373	weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the
 23374	same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look
 23375	at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out
 23376	my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my
 23377	back or my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in
 23378	your hopes and your lies.â
 23379	
 23380	As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to
 23381	look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak,
 23382	too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid,
 23383	misshapen, and grim as ever.
 23384	
 23385	âYes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,â thought Prince
 23386	Andrew. âLet othersâthe youngâyield afresh to that fraud, but we
 23387	know life, our life is finished!â
 23388	
 23389	A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose
 23390	in his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as
 23391	it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion,
 23392	restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything
 23393	anewâbut that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and
 23394	not disturbing himself or desiring anything.
 23395	
 23396	
 23397	
 23398	
 23399	
 23400	CHAPTER II
 23401	
 23402	Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district
 23403	in connection with the affairs of the RyazÃ¡n estate of which he was
 23404	trustee. This Marshal was Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, and in the middle of May
 23405	Prince Andrew went to visit him.
 23406	
 23407	It was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already clothed in
 23408	green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to
 23409	bathe.
 23410	
 23411	Prince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which
 23412	he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds
 23413	of the RostÃ³vsâ house at OtrÃ¡dnoe. He heard merry girlish cries
 23414	behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross
 23415	the path of his calÃ¨che. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a
 23416	dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with
 23417	a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair
 23418	escaped. The girl was shouting something but, seeing that he was a
 23419	stranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.
 23420	
 23421	Suddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so beautiful,
 23422	the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim pretty girl
 23423	did not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was contented and
 23424	cheerful in her own separateâprobably foolishâbut bright and happy
 23425	life. âWhat is she so glad about? What is she thinking of? Not of
 23426	the military regulations or of the arrangement of the RyazÃ¡n serfsâ
 23427	quitrents. Of what is she thinking? Why is she so happy?â Prince
 23428	Andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity.
 23429	
 23430	In 1809 Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v was living at OtrÃ¡dnoe just as he had done
 23431	in former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with
 23432	hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince
 23433	Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying
 23434	the night.
 23435	
 23436	During the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by
 23437	his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old
 23438	countâs house was crowded on account of an approaching name day),
 23439	Prince Andrew repeatedly glanced at NatÃ¡sha, gay and laughing among the
 23440	younger members of the company, and asked himself each time, âWhat is
 23441	she thinking about? Why is she so glad?â
 23442	
 23443	That night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He
 23444	read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the
 23445	room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the
 23446	stupid old man (as he called RostÃ³v), who had made him stay by assuring
 23447	him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he
 23448	was vexed with himself for having stayed.
 23449	
 23450	He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the
 23451	shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst
 23452	into the room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and
 23453	very still. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking
 23454	black on one side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the
 23455	trees grew some kind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit
 23456	leaves and stems here and there. Farther back beyond the dark trees a
 23457	roof glittered with dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly
 23458	white trunk and branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its
 23459	full, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his
 23460	elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky.
 23461	
 23462	His room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were also
 23463	awake. He heard female voices overhead.
 23464	
 23465	âJust once more,â said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew
 23466	recognized at once.
 23467	
 23468	âBut when are you coming to bed?â replied another voice.
 23469	
 23470	âI wonât, I canât sleep, whatâs the use? Come now for the last
 23471	time.â
 23472	
 23473	Two girlish voices sang a musical passageâthe end of some song.
 23474	
 23475	âOh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and thereâs an end of it.â
 23476	
 23477	âYou go to sleep, but I canât,â said the first voice, coming
 23478	nearer to the window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the
 23479	rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard. Everything
 23480	was stone-still, like the moon and its light and the shadows. Prince
 23481	Andrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional
 23482	presence.
 23483	
 23484	âSÃ³nya! SÃ³nya!â he again heard the first speaker. âOh, how can
 23485	you sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up,
 23486	SÃ³nya!â she said almost with tears in her voice. âThere never,
 23487	never was such a lovely night before!â
 23488	
 23489	SÃ³nya made some reluctant reply.
 23490	
 23491	âDo just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come here....
 23492	Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like sitting down
 23493	on my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this, straining tight,
 23494	as tight as possible, and flying away! Like this....â
 23495	
 23496	âTake care, youâll fall out.â
 23497	
 23498	He heard the sound of a scuffle and SÃ³nyaâs disapproving voice:
 23499	âItâs past one oâclock.â
 23500	
 23501	âOh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!â
 23502	
 23503	Again all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting
 23504	there. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.
 23505	
 23506	âO God, O God! What does it mean?â she suddenly exclaimed. âTo bed
 23507	then, if it must be!â and she slammed the casement.
 23508	
 23509	âFor her I might as well not exist!â thought Prince Andrew while he
 23510	listened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that she
 23511	might say something about him. âThere she is again! As if it were on
 23512	purpose,â thought he.
 23513	
 23514	In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful
 23515	thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his life, that unable
 23516	to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once.
 23517	
 23518	
 23519	
 23520	
 23521	
 23522	CHAPTER III
 23523	
 23524	Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not
 23525	waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.
 23526	
 23527	It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove
 23528	into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and
 23529	memorable an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded
 23530	yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was
 23531	thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest
 23532	did not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood
 23533	around, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.
 23534	
 23535	The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only
 23536	a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road
 23537	and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade,
 23538	the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely
 23539	swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales
 23540	trilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now far away.
 23541	
 23542	âYes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,â thought
 23543	Prince Andrew. âBut where is it?â he again wondered, gazing at
 23544	the left side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with
 23545	admiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured,
 23546	spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and
 23547	slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled
 23548	fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in
 23549	evidence now. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were
 23550	no twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old
 23551	veteran could have produced.
 23552	
 23553	âYes, it is the same oak,â thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he
 23554	was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal. All
 23555	the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz
 23556	with the lofty heavens, his wifeâs dead reproachful face, Pierre at
 23557	the ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night
 23558	itself and the moon, and... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.
 23559	
 23560	âNo, life is not over at thirty-one!â Prince Andrew suddenly decided
 23561	finally and decisively. âIt is not enough for me to know what I have
 23562	in meâeveryone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to
 23563	fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be
 23564	lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it, but so that
 23565	it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!â
 23566	
 23567	
 23568	On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn
 23569	and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series of
 23570	sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him
 23571	to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing
 23572	up in his mind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have
 23573	doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month
 23574	before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country
 23575	could ever enter his head. It now seemed clear to him that all his
 23576	experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to
 23577	some kind of work and again played an active part in life. He did not
 23578	even remember how formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical
 23579	arguments, it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if
 23580	he now, after the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe
 23581	in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness
 23582	or love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey
 23583	to RyazÃ¡n he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer
 23584	interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up,
 23585	went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he would
 23586	turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled Ã  la
 23587	grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She
 23588	did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply,
 23589	merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his
 23590	arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as
 23591	he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a
 23592	crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with
 23593	fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and womanâs beauty
 23594	and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was
 23595	particularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.
 23596	
 23597	âMy dear,â Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say,
 23598	âlittle Nicholas canât go out today, itâs very cold.â
 23599	
 23600	âIf it were hot,â Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly
 23601	to his sister, âhe could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he
 23602	must wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That is
 23603	what follows from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child who
 23604	needs fresh air should remain at home,â he would add with extreme
 23605	logic, as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that
 23606	stirred within him.
 23607	
 23608	At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries
 23609	men up.
 23610	
 23611	
 23612	
 23613	
 23614	
 23615	CHAPTER IV
 23616	
 23617	Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time
 23618	when the youthful SperÃ¡nski was at the zenith of his fame and his
 23619	reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That same
 23620	August the Emperor was thrown from his calÃ¨che, injured his leg, and
 23621	remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving SperÃ¡nski every day and no
 23622	one else. At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared
 23623	that so agitated societyâabolishing court ranks and introducing
 23624	examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and
 23625	State Councilorâand not merely these but a whole state constitution,
 23626	intended to change the existing order of government in Russia: legal,
 23627	administrative, and financial, from the Council of State down to the
 23628	district tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams with which the
 23629	Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he had tried to put
 23630	into effect with the aid of his associates, CzartorÃ½ski, NovosÃ­ltsev,
 23631	KochubÃ©y, and StrÃ³gonovâwhom he himself in jest had called his
 23632	ComitÃ© de salut publicâwere taking shape and being realized.
 23633	
 23634	Now all these men were replaced by SperÃ¡nski on the civil side, and
 23635	ArakchÃ©ev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a
 23636	gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a levee. The
 23637	Emperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with a single word.
 23638	It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic
 23639	to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality
 23640	generally, and in the cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he
 23641	now found further confirmation of this surmise. The courtiers explained
 23642	the Emperorâs neglect of him by His Majestyâs displeasure at
 23643	BolkÃ³nskiâs not having served since 1805.
 23644	
 23645	âI know myself that one cannot help oneâs sympathies and
 23646	antipathies,â thought Prince Andrew, âso it will not do to present
 23647	my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor
 23648	personally, but the project will speak for itself.â
 23649	
 23650	He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend
 23651	of his fatherâs. The field marshal made an appointment to see him,
 23652	received him graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few
 23653	days later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the
 23654	Minister of War, Count ArakchÃ©ev.
 23655	
 23656	
 23657	On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count ArakchÃ©evâs waiting
 23658	room at nine in the morning.
 23659	
 23660	He did not know ArakchÃ©ev personally, had never seen him, and all he
 23661	had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.
 23662	
 23663	âHe is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not
 23664	concern myself about his personal qualities: he has been commissioned to
 23665	consider my project, so he alone can get it adopted,â thought Prince
 23666	Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people
 23667	in Count ArakchÃ©evâs waiting room.
 23668	
 23669	During his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the
 23670	anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms
 23671	were well known to him. Count ArakchÃ©evâs anteroom had quite a
 23672	special character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their
 23673	turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of
 23674	those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness, covered
 23675	by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves, their situation, and
 23676	the person for whom they were waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and
 23677	down, others whispered and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname
 23678	âSÃ­la AndrÃ©evichâ and the words, âUncle will give it to us
 23679	hot,â in reference to Count ArakchÃ©ev. One general (an important
 23680	personage), evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long, sat
 23681	crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.
 23682	
 23683	But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all
 23684	facesâthat of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the
 23685	adjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an ironical look and
 23686	was told that his turn would come in due course. After some others had
 23687	been shown in and out of the ministerâs room by the adjutant on duty,
 23688	an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air
 23689	was admitted at that terrible door. This officerâs audience lasted a
 23690	long time. Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard
 23691	from the other side of the door, and the officerâwith pale face and
 23692	trembling lipsâcame out and passed through the waiting room, clutching
 23693	his head.
 23694	
 23695	After this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on
 23696	duty said in a whisper, âTo the right, at the window.â
 23697	
 23698	Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of
 23699	forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles,
 23700	scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red
 23701	nose. ArakchÃ©ev turned his head toward him without looking at him.
 23702	
 23703	âWhat is your petition?â asked ArakchÃ©ev.
 23704	
 23705	âI am not petitioning, your excellency,â returned Prince Andrew
 23706	quietly.
 23707	
 23708	ArakchÃ©evâs eyes turned toward him.
 23709	
 23710	âSit down,â said he. âPrince BolkÃ³nski?â
 23711	
 23712	âI am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has
 23713	deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me...â
 23714	
 23715	âYou see, my dear sir, I have read your project,â interrupted
 23716	ArakchÃ©ev, uttering only the first words amiably and thenâagain
 23717	without looking at Prince Andrewârelapsing gradually into a tone of
 23718	grumbling contempt. âYou are proposing new military laws? There are
 23719	many laws but no one to carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody
 23720	designs laws, it is easier writing than doing.â
 23721	
 23722	âI came at His Majesty the Emperorâs wish to learn from your
 23723	excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have
 23724	presented,â said Prince Andrew politely.
 23725	
 23726	âI have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the
 23727	committee. I do not approve of it,â said ArakchÃ©ev, rising and taking
 23728	a paper from his writing table. âHere!â and he handed it to Prince
 23729	Andrew.
 23730	
 23731	Across the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters,
 23732	misspelled, and without punctuation: âUnsoundly constructed because
 23733	resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles
 23734	of War needlessly deviating.â
 23735	
 23736	âTo what committee has the memorandum been referred?â inquired
 23737	Prince Andrew.
 23738	
 23739	âTo the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that
 23740	your honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.â
 23741	
 23742	Prince Andrew smiled.
 23743	
 23744	âI donât want one.â
 23745	
 23746	âA member without salary,â repeated ArakchÃ©ev. âI have the
 23747	honor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?â he shouted, bowing
 23748	to Prince Andrew.
 23749	
 23750	
 23751	
 23752	
 23753	
 23754	CHAPTER V
 23755	
 23756	While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee
 23757	Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly those he
 23758	knew to be in power and whose aid he might need. In Petersburg he now
 23759	experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when
 23760	troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling
 23761	circles where the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was
 23762	being shaped. From the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the
 23763	uninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation
 23764	of everyone, and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose
 23765	existence he learned every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in
 23766	Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation, the commander in
 23767	chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know, but who was
 23768	supposed to be a man of geniusâSperÃ¡nski. And this movement of
 23769	reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and SperÃ¡nski
 23770	its chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question
 23771	of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his
 23772	consciousness.
 23773	
 23774	Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the
 23775	highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming
 23776	party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because
 23777	he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by
 23778	liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal.
 23779	The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations,
 23780	turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the
 23781	reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine
 23782	society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a
 23783	good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account
 23784	of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this
 23785	the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had
 23786	greatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown
 23787	more manly, lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony,
 23788	and acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about
 23789	him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him.
 23790	
 23791	The day after his interview with Count ArakchÃ©ev, Prince Andrew spent
 23792	the evening at Count KochubÃ©yâs. He told the count of his interview
 23793	with SÃ­la AndrÃ©evich (KochubÃ©y spoke of ArakchÃ©ev by that nickname
 23794	with the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of
 23795	Warâs anteroom).
 23796	
 23797	âMon cher, even in this case you canât do without Michael
 23798	MikhÃ¡ylovich SperÃ¡nski. He manages everything. Iâll speak to him. He
 23799	has promised to come this evening.â
 23800	
 23801	âWhat has SperÃ¡nski to do with the army regulations?â asked Prince
 23802	Andrew.
 23803	
 23804	KochubÃ©y shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at BolkÃ³nskiâs
 23805	simplicity.
 23806	
 23807	âWe were talking to him about you a few days ago,â KochubÃ©y
 23808	continued, âand about your freed plowmen.â
 23809	
 23810	âOh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?â said an old man
 23811	of Catherineâs day, turning contemptuously toward BolkÃ³nski.
 23812	
 23813	âIt was a small estate that brought in no profit,â replied Prince
 23814	Andrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man
 23815	uselessly.
 23816	
 23817	âAfraid of being late...â said the old man, looking at KochubÃ©y.
 23818	
 23819	âThereâs one thing I donât understand,â he continued. âWho
 23820	will plow the land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but
 23821	difficult to rule.... Just the same as nowâI ask you, Countâwho will
 23822	be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?â
 23823	
 23824	âThose who pass the examinations, I suppose,â replied KochubÃ©y,
 23825	crossing his legs and glancing round.
 23826	
 23827	âWell, I have PryÃ¡nichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a
 23828	priceless man, but heâs sixty. Is he to go up for examination?â
 23829	
 23830	âYes, thatâs a difficulty, as education is not at all general,
 23831	but...â
 23832	
 23833	Count KochubÃ©y did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the arm,
 23834	and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open
 23835	forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was
 23836	just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a
 23837	cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It was
 23838	SperÃ¡nski. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a throb
 23839	within him, as happens at critical moments of life. Whether it was from
 23840	respect, envy, or anticipation, he did not know. SperÃ¡nskiâs whole
 23841	figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable. In
 23842	the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who
 23843	together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and
 23844	self-assurance; he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression
 23845	as that in those half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that
 23846	expressed nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft
 23847	voice; above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or
 23848	handsâhands which were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. Such
 23849	whiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of
 23850	soldiers who had been long in hospital. This was SperÃ¡nski, Secretary
 23851	of State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he
 23852	had more than once met and talked with Napoleon.
 23853	
 23854	SperÃ¡nski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people
 23855	involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to
 23856	speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and
 23857	he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.
 23858	
 23859	Prince Andrew followed SperÃ¡nskiâs every word and movement with
 23860	particular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men
 23861	who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting
 23862	anyone newâespecially anyone whom, like SperÃ¡nski, he knew by
 23863	reputationâexpected to discover in him the perfection of human
 23864	qualities.
 23865	
 23866	SperÃ¡nski told KochubÃ©y he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner
 23867	as he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the Emperor
 23868	had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty.
 23869	When KochubÃ©y introduced Prince Andrew, SperÃ¡nski slowly turned
 23870	his eyes to BolkÃ³nski with his customary smile and looked at him in
 23871	silence.
 23872	
 23873	âI am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as
 23874	everyone has,â he said after a pause.
 23875	
 23876	KochubÃ©y said a few words about the reception ArakchÃ©ev had given
 23877	BolkÃ³nski. SperÃ¡nski smiled more markedly.
 23878	
 23879	âThe chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend
 23880	Monsieur MagnÃ­tski,â he said, fully articulating every word and
 23881	syllable, âand if you like I can put you in touch with him.â He
 23882	paused at the full stop. âI hope you will find him sympathetic and
 23883	ready to co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable.â
 23884	
 23885	A circle soon formed round SperÃ¡nski, and the old man who had talked
 23886	about his subordinate PryÃ¡nichnikov addressed a question to him.
 23887	
 23888	Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement
 23889	of SperÃ¡nskiâs: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity
 23890	student, who now, BolkÃ³nski thought, held in his handsâthose plump
 23891	white handsâthe fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the
 23892	extraordinarily disdainful composure with which SperÃ¡nski answered
 23893	the old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from
 23894	an immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud,
 23895	SperÃ¡nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or
 23896	disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.
 23897	
 23898	Having talked for a little while in the general circle, SperÃ¡nski rose
 23899	and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the
 23900	room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in
 23901	BolkÃ³nski.
 23902	
 23903	âI had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated
 23904	conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,â he said
 23905	with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he
 23906	and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom
 23907	he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. âI have known
 23908	of you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your
 23909	serfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should
 23910	be more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen
 23911	of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new
 23912	decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so
 23913	much gossip and tittle-tattle.â
 23914	
 23915	âNo,â said Prince Andrew, âmy father did not wish me to take
 23916	advantage of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.â
 23917	
 23918	âYour father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above our
 23919	contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re-establishes
 23920	natural justice.â
 23921	
 23922	âI think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,â
 23923	returned Prince Andrew, trying to resist SperÃ¡nskiâs influence, of
 23924	which he began to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in
 23925	everything and felt a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke easily
 23926	and well, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking
 23927	with SperÃ¡nski. He was too much absorbed in observing the famous
 23928	manâs personality.
 23929	
 23930	âGrounds of personal ambition maybe,â SperÃ¡nski put in quietly.
 23931	
 23932	âAnd of state interest to some extent,â said Prince Andrew.
 23933	
 23934	âWhat do you mean?â asked SperÃ¡nski quietly, lowering his eyes.
 23935	
 23936	âI am an admirer of Montesquieu,â replied Prince Andrew, âand
 23937	his idea that le principe des monarchies est lâhonneur me paraÃ®t
 23938	incontestable. Certains droits et privilÃ¨ges de la noblesse me
 23939	paraissent Ãªtre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment.â *
 23940	
 23941	     * âThe principle of monarchies is honor seems to me
 23942	     incontestable. Certain rights and privileges for the
 23943	     aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that
 23944	     sentiment.â
 23945	
 23946	
 23947	The smile vanished from SperÃ¡nskiâs white face, which was much
 23948	improved by the change. Probably Prince Andrewâs thought interested
 23949	him.
 23950	
 23951	âSi vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,â * he began,
 23952	pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower
 23953	than in Russian but quite calmly.
 23954	
 23955	    * âIf you regard the question from that point of view.â
 23956	
 23957	
 23958	SperÃ¡nski went on to say that honor, lâhonneur, cannot be upheld by
 23959	privileges harmful to the service; that honor, lâhonneur, is either a
 23960	negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of
 23961	emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it.
 23962	His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.
 23963	
 23964	âAn institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one
 23965	similar to the LÃ©gion dâhonneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not
 23966	harmful but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class or
 23967	court privilege.â
 23968	
 23969	âI do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges
 23970	have attained the same end,â returned Prince Andrew. âEvery courtier
 23971	considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.â
 23972	
 23973	âYet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,â
 23974	said SperÃ¡nski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably
 23975	an argument which was embarrassing for his companion. âIf you will
 23976	do me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday,â he added, âI will,
 23977	after talking with MagnÃ­tski, let you know what may interest you, and
 23978	shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you.â
 23979	
 23980	Closing his eyes, he bowed Ã  la franÃ§aise, without taking leave, and
 23981	trying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room.
 23982	
 23983	
 23984	
 23985	
 23986	
 23987	CHAPTER VI
 23988	
 23989	During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the
 23990	whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite
 23991	overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.
 23992	
 23993	On returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four
 23994	or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The mechanism
 23995	of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere,
 23996	absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing, did
 23997	not even think or find time to think, but only talked, and talked
 23998	successfully, of what he had thought while in the country.
 23999	
 24000	He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same
 24001	remark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy for
 24002	whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking
 24003	of nothing.
 24004	
 24005	As he had done on their first meeting at KochubÃ©yâs, SperÃ¡nski
 24006	produced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he
 24007	received him tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte at his own house and talked to him long and
 24008	confidentially.
 24009	
 24010	To BolkÃ³nski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant
 24011	creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that
 24012	perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in
 24013	SperÃ¡nski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous
 24014	man. Had SperÃ¡nski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed
 24015	the same breeding and traditions, BolkÃ³nski would soon have discovered
 24016	his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, SperÃ¡nskiâs strange
 24017	and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because
 24018	he did not quite understand him. Moreover, SperÃ¡nski, either because he
 24019	appreciated the otherâs capacity or because he considered it necessary
 24020	to win him to his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness
 24021	before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which
 24022	goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption
 24023	that oneâs companion is the only man besides oneself capable of
 24024	understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness
 24025	and profundity of oneâs own ideas.
 24026	
 24027	During their long conversation on Wednesday evening, SperÃ¡nski more
 24028	than once remarked: âWe regard everything that is above the common
 24029	level of rooted custom...â or, with a smile: âBut we want the wolves
 24030	to be fed and the sheep to be safe...â or: âThey cannot understand
 24031	this...â and all in a way that seemed to say: âWe, you and I,
 24032	understand what they are and who we are.â
 24033	
 24034	This first long conversation with SperÃ¡nski only strengthened in Prince
 24035	Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting.
 24036	He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by
 24037	his energy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely
 24038	for the welfare of Russia. In Prince Andrewâs eyes SperÃ¡nski was the
 24039	man he would himself have wished to beâone who explained all the facts
 24040	of life reasonably, considered important only what was rational, and
 24041	was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything
 24042	seemed so simple and clear in SperÃ¡nskiâs exposition that Prince
 24043	Andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and
 24044	argued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and
 24045	not submit to SperÃ¡nskiâs opinions entirely. Everything was right
 24046	and everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince
 24047	Andrew. This was SperÃ¡nskiâs cold, mirrorlike look, which did not
 24048	allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which
 24049	Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of
 24050	those who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands
 24051	irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was unpleasantly
 24052	struck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in
 24053	SperÃ¡nski, and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to
 24054	support his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental device, except
 24055	analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrew, from one
 24056	to another. Now he would take up the position of a practical man and
 24057	condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his
 24058	opponents; now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise to the realm of
 24059	metaphysics. (This last resource was one he very frequently employed.)
 24060	He would transfer a question to metaphysical heights, pass on to
 24061	definitions of space, time, and thought, and, having deduced the
 24062	refutation he needed, would again descend to the level of the original
 24063	discussion.
 24064	
 24065	In general the trait of SperÃ¡nskiâs mentality which struck Prince
 24066	Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and
 24067	authority of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur
 24068	to him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is
 24069	after all impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had never
 24070	felt the doubt, âIs not all I think and believe nonsense?â And
 24071	it was just this peculiarity of SperÃ¡nskiâs mind that particularly
 24072	attracted Prince Andrew.
 24073	
 24074	During the first period of their acquaintance BolkÃ³nski felt a
 24075	passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for
 24076	Bonaparte. The fact that SperÃ¡nski was the son of a village priest,
 24077	and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his
 24078	humble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to cherish his
 24079	sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to strengthen it.
 24080	
 24081	On that first evening BolkÃ³nski spent with him, having mentioned the
 24082	Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, SperÃ¡nski told him
 24083	sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty
 24084	years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf
 24085	had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes.
 24086	
 24087	âAnd that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,â said
 24088	he. âWe want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have no
 24089	laws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in
 24090	these times!â
 24091	
 24092	Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was
 24093	needed which he did not possess.
 24094	
 24095	âBut nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious
 24096	circle from which we must break a way out.â
 24097	
 24098	A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army
 24099	Regulations andâwhat he had not at all expectedâwas chairman of a
 24100	section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At SperÃ¡nskiâs
 24101	request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up
 24102	and, with the aid of the Code NapolÃ©on and the Institutes of Justinian,
 24103	he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights.
 24104	
 24105	
 24106	
 24107	
 24108	
 24109	CHAPTER VII
 24110	
 24111	Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg
 24112	after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading
 24113	position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral
 24114	lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various
 24115	lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection
 24116	of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms,
 24117	in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular.
 24118	He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in
 24119	Petersburg.
 24120	
 24121	His life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and
 24122	dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered
 24123	it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the
 24124	bachelor circles in which he moved.
 24125	
 24126	Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at
 24127	the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest
 24128	upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him.
 24129	At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the
 24130	closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had joined
 24131	the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently
 24132	steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it
 24133	sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put
 24134	his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and
 24135	involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.
 24136	
 24137	Joseph AlexÃ©evich was not in Petersburgâhe had of late stood aside
 24138	from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost entirely in
 24139	Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary
 24140	life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in
 24141	Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or IvÃ¡n VasÃ­levich D., whom he knew
 24142	in society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under the Masonic
 24143	aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they
 24144	aimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up
 24145	twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a
 24146	dozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre
 24147	remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote
 24148	all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to
 24149	dwell arose in his soul.
 24150	
 24151	He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first he
 24152	put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges
 24153	or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical
 24154	science of the order: with questions of the threefold designation of
 24155	God, the three primordial elementsâsulphur, mercury, and saltâor
 24156	the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of
 24157	Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones
 24158	chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph AlexÃ©evich himself,
 24159	but he did not share their interests. His heart was not in the mystical
 24160	aspect of Freemasonry.
 24161	
 24162	In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him,
 24163	seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight
 24164	and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.
 24165	
 24166	In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw
 24167	nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized
 24168	the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their
 24169	purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master
 24170	of the principal lodge.
 24171	
 24172	Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,
 24173	particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierreâs
 24174	observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for
 24175	anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy
 24176	young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank,
 24177	and of whom there were very many in the lodge.
 24178	
 24179	Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry,
 24180	at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely
 24181	on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but
 24182	suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated
 24183	from its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went
 24184	abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order.
 24185	
 24186	In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our Freemasons knew
 24187	from correspondence with those abroad that BezÃºkhov had obtained the
 24188	confidence of many highly placed persons, had been initiated into many
 24189	mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was bringing back with
 24190	him much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause
 24191	in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him, tried to
 24192	ingratiate themselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he was
 24193	preparing something for them and concealing it.
 24194	
 24195	A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at
 24196	which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what
 24197	he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order. The
 24198	meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began
 24199	his address.
 24200	
 24201	âDear Brothers,â he began, blushing and stammering, with a written
 24202	speech in his hand, âit is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in
 24203	the seclusion of our lodgeâwe must actâact! We are drowsing, but we
 24204	must act.â Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.
 24205	
 24206	âFor the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of
 24207	virtue,â he read, âwe must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse
 24208	principles in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the
 24209	education of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the
 24210	wisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and
 24211	folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity
 24212	of purpose and possessed of authority and power.
 24213	
 24214	âTo attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice
 24215	and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world,
 24216	receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we
 24217	are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What is
 24218	to be done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow
 24219	everything, repel force by force?... No! We are very far from that.
 24220	Every violent reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy
 24221	evil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no
 24222	violence.
 24223	
 24224	âThe whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of
 24225	preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of
 24226	convictionâaiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing
 24227	talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and attaching
 24228	them to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order have the power
 24229	unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to
 24230	control them without their being aware of it. In a word, we must found a
 24231	form of government holding universal sway, which should be diffused over
 24232	the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside
 24233	which all other governments can continue in their customary course and
 24234	do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order, which
 24235	is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice. This aim was that of
 24236	Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and good and for their
 24237	own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest
 24238	men.
 24239	
 24240	âAt that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching
 24241	alone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her with
 24242	special strength, but now we need much more powerful methods. It is
 24243	now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue
 24244	a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the
 24245	passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is
 24246	therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions
 24247	within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means to that end.
 24248	
 24249	âAs soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state,
 24250	each of them again training two others and all being closely united,
 24251	everything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret
 24252	accomplished much for the welfare of mankind.â
 24253	
 24254	This speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in
 24255	the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs
 24256	of Illuminism, * met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand
 24257	Master began answering him, and Pierre began developing his views with
 24258	more and more warmth. It was long since there had been so stormy a
 24259	meeting. Parties were formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others
 24260	supporting him. At that meeting he was struck for the first time by
 24261	the endless variety of menâs minds, which prevents a truth from ever
 24262	presenting itself identically to two persons. Even those members
 24263	who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with
 24264	limitations and alterations he could not agree to, as what he always
 24265	wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself
 24266	understood it.
 24267	
 24268	     * The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for
 24269	     monarchical institutions.
 24270	
 24271	At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will
 24272	reproved BezÃºkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue
 24273	alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.
 24274	Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would
 24275	be accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the
 24276	usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.
 24277	
 24278	
 24279	
 24280	
 24281	
 24282	CHAPTER VIII
 24283	
 24284	Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For three
 24285	days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at
 24286	home receiving no one and going nowhere.
 24287	
 24288	It was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored
 24289	him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she
 24290	wished to devote her whole life to him.
 24291	
 24292	At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would
 24293	return to Petersburg from abroad.
 24294	
 24295	Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected
 24296	less than the others forced his way in to see him and, turning the
 24297	conversation upon Pierreâs matrimonial affairs, by way of fraternal
 24298	advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong
 24299	and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not
 24300	forgiving the penitent.
 24301	
 24302	At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince VasÃ­liâs wife, sent to
 24303	him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most
 24304	important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and
 24305	that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then
 24306	was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him.
 24307	Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the
 24308	influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his
 24309	liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife.
 24310	
 24311	âNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to
 24312	blame,â he thought.
 24313	
 24314	If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it
 24315	was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take
 24316	any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away.
 24317	Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference
 24318	whether he lived with his wife or not?
 24319	
 24320	Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late
 24321	one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph
 24322	AlexÃ©evich. This is what he noted in his diary:
 24323	
 24324	Moscow, 17th November
 24325	
 24326	I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I
 24327	have experienced. Joseph AlexÃ©evich is living poorly and has for three
 24328	years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has
 24329	ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till
 24330	late at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working
 24331	at science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed
 24332	on which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of
 24333	Jerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild
 24334	smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges.
 24335	I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed
 24336	to our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of
 24337	my rupture with the Brothers. Joseph AlexÃ©evich, having remained silent
 24338	and thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which
 24339	at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow.
 24340	He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of
 24341	the order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The
 24342	purification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The
 24343	improvement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which
 24344	is the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and
 24345	self-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently
 24346	of circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the
 24347	greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of
 24348	this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our
 24349	impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of
 24350	the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
 24351	profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is
 24352	attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground
 24353	Joseph AlexÃ©evich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the
 24354	depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said
 24355	to me, âthe chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in
 24356	perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties
 24357	of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary,
 24358	my dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain
 24359	our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledgeâfor man can only know himself
 24360	by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by
 24361	conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtueâlove of death.
 24362	Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our
 24363	innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.â These words are all
 24364	the more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings,
 24365	Joseph AlexÃ©evich is never weary of life though he loves death, for
 24366	whichâin spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner manâhe does
 24367	not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained
 24368	to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out
 24369	to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He
 24370	advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but
 24371	to take up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while
 24372	diverting the Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path
 24373	self-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for
 24374	myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end
 24375	he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will
 24376	in future note down all my actions.
 24377	
 24378	Petersburg, 23rd November
 24379	
 24380	I am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears and
 24381	said that HÃ©lÃ¨ne was here and that she implored me to hear her; that
 24382	she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew
 24383	that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on
 24384	refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and
 24385	advice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what
 24386	to do. I went to my room and reread Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs letters and
 24387	recalled my conversations with him, and deduced from it all that I
 24388	ought not to refuse a supplicant, and ought to reach a helping hand to
 24389	everyoneâespecially to one so closely bound to meâand that I must
 24390	bear my cross. But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right, then
 24391	let union with her have only a spiritual aim. That is what I decided,
 24392	and what I wrote to Joseph AlexÃ©evich. I told my wife that I begged her
 24393	to forget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her,
 24394	and that I had nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She
 24395	need not know how hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on
 24396	the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of
 24397	regeneration.
 24398	
 24399	
 24400	
 24401	
 24402	
 24403	CHAPTER IX
 24404	
 24405	At that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at court
 24406	and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each with its
 24407	own particular tone. The largest of these was the French circle of the
 24408	Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count RumyÃ¡ntsev and Caulaincourt.
 24409	In this group HÃ©lÃ¨ne, as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with
 24410	her husband, took a very prominent place. She was visited by the members
 24411	of the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for
 24412	their intellect and polished manners.
 24413	
 24414	HÃ©lÃ¨ne had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors
 24415	and had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic
 24416	notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself
 24417	had noticed her in the theater and said of her: âCâest un superbe
 24418	animal.â * Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not
 24419	surprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer than before. What did
 24420	surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded
 24421	in gaining the reputation âdâ une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle
 24422	que belle.â *(2) The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her
 24423	eight-page letters. BilÃ­bin saved up his epigrams to produce them
 24424	in Countess BezÃºkhovaâs presence. To be received in the Countess
 24425	BezÃºkhovaâs salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect. Young men
 24426	read books before attending HÃ©lÃ¨neâs evenings, to have something to
 24427	say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors,
 24428	confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a way HÃ©lÃ¨ne was a
 24429	power. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes attended, with a
 24430	strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner parties,
 24431	where politics, poetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these parties
 24432	his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick
 24433	to be found out at any moment. But whether because stupidity was just
 24434	what was needed to run such a salon, or because those who were deceived
 24435	found pleasure in the deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and
 24436	HÃ©lÃ¨ne BezÃºkhovaâs reputation as a lovely and clever woman became
 24437	so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest
 24438	things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers
 24439	and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no
 24440	conception.
 24441	
 24442	     * âThatâs a superb animal.â
 24443	
 24444	     * (2) âOf a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely.â
 24445	
 24446	
 24447	Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He was
 24448	that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no oneâs
 24449	way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the
 24450	drawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an
 24451	advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during
 24452	the last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract
 24453	interests and his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his
 24454	wifeâs circle, which did not interest him, that air of unconcern,
 24455	indifference, and benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired
 24456	artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered
 24457	his wifeâs drawing room as one enters a theater, was acquainted with
 24458	everybody, equally pleased to see everyone, and equally indifferent to
 24459	them all. Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him
 24460	and, regardless of whether any âgentlemen of the embassyâ were
 24461	present or not, lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not
 24462	at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general
 24463	opinion concerning the queer husband of âthe most distinguished woman
 24464	in Petersburgâ was so well established that no one took his freaks
 24465	seriously.
 24466	
 24467	Among the many young men who frequented her house every day, BorÃ­s
 24468	DrubetskÃ³y, who had already achieved great success in the service, was
 24469	the most intimate friend of the BezÃºkhov household since HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 24470	return from Erfurt. HÃ©lÃ¨ne spoke of him as âmon pageâ and treated
 24471	him like a child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody,
 24472	but sometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him BorÃ­s
 24473	behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade
 24474	of deference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three
 24475	years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him
 24476	that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition, first
 24477	by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself
 24478	to suspect.
 24479	
 24480	âNo, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced
 24481	her former infatuations,â he told himself. âThere has never been
 24482	an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the
 24483	heartââa statement which, though gathered from an unknown source,
 24484	he believed implicitly. Yet strange to say BorÃ­sâ presence in his
 24485	wifeâs drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a physical
 24486	effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed the
 24487	unconsciousness and freedom of his movements.
 24488	
 24489	âWhat a strange antipathy,â thought Pierre, âyet I used to like
 24490	him very much.â
 24491	
 24492	In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind
 24493	and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did
 24494	nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow. But
 24495	a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place
 24496	all this time in Pierreâs soul, revealing much to him and causing him
 24497	many spiritual doubts and joys.
 24498	
 24499	
 24500	
 24501	
 24502	
 24503	CHAPTER X
 24504	
 24505	Pierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during
 24506	that time:
 24507	
 24508	
 24509	24th November
 24510	
 24511	Got up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. (By Joseph
 24512	AlexÃ©evichâs advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and
 24513	served on one of the committees.) Returned home for dinner and dined
 24514	aloneâthe countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and drank
 24515	moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers.
 24516	In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about
 24517	B., and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody
 24518	laughed loudly at it.
 24519	
 24520	I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me to
 24521	walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation,
 24522	(2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw
 24523	from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family
 24524	duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.
 24525	
 24526	
 24527	27th November
 24528	
 24529	I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,
 24530	help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures,
 24531	but without proper feeling. Brother UrÃºsov came and we talked about
 24532	worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperorâs new projects. I began
 24533	to criticize them, but remembered my rules and my benefactorâs
 24534	wordsâthat a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state
 24535	when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to
 24536	assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O. visited me and we
 24537	had a preliminary talk about the reception of a new Brother. They laid
 24538	on me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak and unworthy. Then our
 24539	talk turned to the interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the
 24540	Temple, the seven sciences, the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the
 24541	seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Brother O. was very eloquent. In the
 24542	evening the admission took place. The new decoration of the Premises
 24543	contributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle. It was BorÃ­s
 24544	DrubetskÃ³y who was admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A
 24545	strange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the
 24546	dark chamber. I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him
 24547	which I vainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like
 24548	to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil
 24549	thoughts of him did not leave me. It seemed to me that his object in
 24550	entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with
 24551	members of our lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me several
 24552	times whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I
 24553	could not reply) and that according to my observation he is incapable of
 24554	feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied
 24555	with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to
 24556	doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all the time I stood
 24557	alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling
 24558	contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to stab his bare breast
 24559	with the sword I held to it. I could not be eloquent, nor could I
 24560	frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to the Grand Master. Great
 24561	Architect of Nature, help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth
 24562	of lies!
 24563	
 24564	
 24565	After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then the
 24566	following was written:
 24567	
 24568	
 24569	I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who
 24570	advised me to hold fast by Brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was
 24571	revealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim
 24572	is the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name unutterable
 24573	which means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen, refresh, and
 24574	support me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt has no place.
 24575	The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our
 24576	sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human sciences dissect
 24577	everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to examine it. In the
 24578	holy science of our order all is one, all is known in its entirety and
 24579	life. The Trinityâthe three elements of matterâare sulphur, mercury,
 24580	and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature; in combination with
 24581	salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means
 24582	of which it attracts mercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination
 24583	produces other bodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence.
 24584	Christ, the Holy Spirit, Him!...
 24585	
 24586	
 24587	3rd December
 24588	
 24589	Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went and
 24590	paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my
 24591	imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when DÃ³lokhov,
 24592	meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying
 24593	perfect peace of mind in spite of my wifeâs absence. At the time I
 24594	gave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in
 24595	my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies. I recollected
 24596	myself and drove away that thought only when I found myself glowing with
 24597	anger, but I did not sufficiently repent. Afterwards BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y
 24598	came and began relating various adventures. His coming vexed me from the
 24599	first, and I said something disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared
 24600	up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him. He became
 24601	silent, and I recollected myself only when it was too late. My God, I
 24602	cannot get on with him at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set
 24603	myself above him and so become much worse than he, for he is lenient
 24604	to my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God,
 24605	grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave
 24606	so that he too may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was
 24607	drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, âThy
 24608	day!â
 24609	
 24610	I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by
 24611	dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left
 24612	thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with
 24613	my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began
 24614	biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the bigger and
 24615	heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led
 24616	me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank.
 24617	I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a
 24618	fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I
 24619	dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on
 24620	the other. I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and
 24621	pointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and in the garden was a large
 24622	and beautiful building. I woke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature,
 24623	help me to tear from myself these dogsâmy passions especially the
 24624	last, which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones, and
 24625	aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in
 24626	my dream.
 24627	
 24628	
 24629	7th December
 24630	
 24631	I dreamed that Joseph AlexÃ©evich was sitting in my house, and that I
 24632	was very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered
 24633	incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could
 24634	not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But
 24635	as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young,
 24636	and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order,
 24637	but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left
 24638	the room and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on
 24639	the floor. He was telling me something, and I wished to show him my
 24640	sensibility, and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing
 24641	to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying
 24642	me. And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he
 24643	looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I
 24644	felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern
 24645	me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, and then we suddenly
 24646	found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed. He lay down
 24647	on the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down
 24648	too. And he said, âTell me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do
 24649	you know it? I think you know it already.â Abashed by this question,
 24650	I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head
 24651	incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living
 24652	with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To
 24653	this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of oneâs embraces
 24654	and gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that
 24655	I should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I
 24656	awoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel: âThe life was
 24657	the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
 24658	comprehended it not.â Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs face had looked young
 24659	and bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he
 24660	wrote about âconjugal duties.â
 24661	
 24662	
 24663	9th December
 24664	
 24665	I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw that
 24666	I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and Joseph
 24667	AlexÃ©evich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at once that
 24668	the process of regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed
 24669	to meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands, and he said, âHast
 24670	thou noticed that my face is different?â I looked at him, still
 24671	holding him in my arms, and saw that his face was young, but that he
 24672	had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed. And I said,
 24673	âI should have known you had I met you by chance,â and I thought to
 24674	myself, âAm I telling the truth?â And suddenly I saw him lying like
 24675	a dead body; then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study
 24676	carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper; I said, âI drew
 24677	that,â and he answered by bowing his head. I opened the book, and on
 24678	all the pages there were excellent drawings. And in my dream I knew
 24679	that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its
 24680	beloved. And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden
 24681	in transparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up to the
 24682	clouds. And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a
 24683	representation of the Song of Songs. And looking at those drawings I
 24684	dreamed I felt that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away
 24685	from them. Lord, help me! My God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy
 24686	will be done; but if I am myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I
 24687	shall perish of my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!
 24688

 24693	CHAPTER XI
 24694	
 24695	The RostÃ³vsâ monetary affairs had not improved during the two years
 24696	they had spent in the country.
 24697	
 24698	Though Nicholas RostÃ³v had kept firmly to his resolution and was still
 24699	serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little,
 24700	the way of life at OtrÃ¡dnoeâMÃ­tenkaâs management of affairs, in
 24701	particularâwas such that the debts inevitably increased every year.
 24702	The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to
 24703	apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one
 24704	and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last
 24705	time.
 24706	
 24707	Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to VÃ©ra and was
 24708	accepted.
 24709	
 24710	Though in Moscow the RostÃ³vs belonged to the best society without
 24711	themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of
 24712	acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were
 24713	provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without
 24714	inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.
 24715	
 24716	The RostÃ³vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in
 24717	Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country
 24718	neighbors from OtrÃ¡dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters,
 24719	PerÃ³nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre BezÃºkhov, and the son of their
 24720	district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the
 24721	men who very soon became frequent visitors at the RostÃ³vsâ house in
 24722	Petersburg were BorÃ­s, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and
 24723	dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the RostÃ³vsâ
 24724	and paid the eldest daughter, Countess VÃ©ra, the attentions a young man
 24725	pays when he intends to propose.
 24726	
 24727	Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
 24728	Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He
 24729	narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that
 24730	everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had
 24731	obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.
 24732	
 24733	In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked
 24734	up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near
 24735	the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had
 24736	done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and
 24737	so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do
 24738	this, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also. In
 24739	1809 he was a captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special
 24740	lucrative posts in Petersburg.
 24741	
 24742	Though some skeptics smiled when told of Bergâs merits, it could not
 24743	be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent
 24744	terms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career
 24745	before him and an assured position in society.
 24746	
 24747	Four years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow
 24748	theater, Berg had pointed out VÃ©ra RostÃ³va to him and had said in
 24749	German, âdas soll mein Weib werden,â * and from that moment had
 24750	made up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the
 24751	RostÃ³vsâ position and his own, he decided that the time had come to
 24752	propose.
 24753	
 24754	    * âThat girl shall be my wife.â
 24755	
 24756	
 24757	Bergâs proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
 24758	flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure
 24759	Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess RostÃ³va; but
 24760	Bergâs chief characteristic was such a naÃ¯ve and good natured egotism
 24761	that the RostÃ³vs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing,
 24762	since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed
 24763	excellent. Moreover, the RostÃ³vsâ affairs were seriously embarrassed,
 24764	as the suitor could not but know; and above all, VÃ©ra was twenty-four,
 24765	had been taken out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking
 24766	and sensible, no one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave their
 24767	consent.
 24768	
 24769	âYou see,â said Berg to his comrade, whom he called âfriendâ
 24770	only because he knew that everyone has friends, âyou see, I have
 24771	considered it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out
 24772	or if it were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and
 24773	mamma are now provided forâI have arranged that rent for them in the
 24774	Baltic Provincesâand I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with
 24775	her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not
 24776	marrying for moneyâI consider that dishonorableâbut a wife should
 24777	bring her share and a husband his. I have my position in the service,
 24778	she has connections and some means. In our times that is worth
 24779	something, isnât it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable girl,
 24780	and she loves me....â
 24781	
 24782	Berg blushed and smiled.
 24783	
 24784	âAnd I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.
 24785	Now the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite
 24786	differentâan unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence.
 24787	She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my fiancÃ©e!... Well, you
 24788	will be coming,â he was going to say, âto dine,â but changed his
 24789	mind and said âto take tea with us,â and quickly doubling up his
 24790	tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying
 24791	his dream of happiness.
 24792	
 24793	After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Bergâs
 24794	proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took
 24795	possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere.
 24796	In the familyâs feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness
 24797	and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved
 24798	VÃ©ra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands. The
 24799	old count felt this most. He would probably have been unable to state
 24800	the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his
 24801	affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what his debts amounted
 24802	to, or what dowry he could give VÃ©ra. When his daughters were born
 24803	he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three
 24804	hundred serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold, and the
 24805	other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would
 24806	have to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to VÃ©ra. Nor had
 24807	he any money.
 24808	
 24809	Berg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained before
 24810	the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the
 24811	question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the
 24812	count thought of giving her the RyazÃ¡n estate or of selling a forest,
 24813	at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before
 24814	the wedding Berg entered the countâs study early one morning and, with
 24815	a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let
 24816	him know what VÃ©raâs dowry would be. The count was so disconcerted by
 24817	this long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first
 24818	reply that came into his head. âI like your being businesslike about
 24819	it.... I like it. You shall be satisfied....â
 24820	
 24821	And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the
 24822	conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not
 24823	know for certain how much VÃ©ra would have and did not receive at least
 24824	part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.
 24825	
 24826	âBecause, consider, Countâif I allowed myself to marry now
 24827	without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting
 24828	badly....â
 24829	
 24830	The conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to
 24831	avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand
 24832	for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the
 24833	shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible
 24834	for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in
 24835	ready money. âOr at least twenty thousand, Count,â he added, âand
 24836	then a note of hand for only sixty thousand.â
 24837	
 24838	âYes, yes, all right!â said the count hurriedly. âOnly excuse me,
 24839	my dear fellow, Iâll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for
 24840	eighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me.â
 24841	
 24842	
 24843	
 24844	
 24845	
 24846	CHAPTER XII
 24847	
 24848	NatÃ¡sha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which
 24849	she had counted on her fingers with BorÃ­s after they had kissed four
 24850	years ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before SÃ³nya and her
 24851	mother, if BorÃ­s happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of
 24852	that episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not
 24853	worth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question
 24854	whether her engagement to BorÃ­s was a jest or an important, binding
 24855	promise tormented her.
 24856	
 24857	Since BorÃ­s left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the
 24858	RostÃ³vs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed near
 24859	OtrÃ¡dnoe, but had never been to see them.
 24860	
 24861	Sometimes it occurred to NatÃ¡sha that he did not wish to see her, and
 24862	this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
 24863	of him.
 24864	
 24865	âNowadays old friends are not remembered,â the countess would say
 24866	when BorÃ­s was mentioned.
 24867	
 24868	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed
 24869	to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously
 24870	and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
 24871	which he had entered. When the RostÃ³vs came to Petersburg BorÃ­s called
 24872	on them.
 24873	
 24874	He drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of NatÃ¡sha was
 24875	his most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of
 24876	letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between
 24877	himself and NatÃ¡sha could not be binding either on her or on him. He
 24878	had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess
 24879	BezÃºkhova, a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage
 24880	of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he
 24881	was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in
 24882	Petersburg, plans which might very easily be realized. When he entered
 24883	the RostÃ³vsâ drawing room NatÃ¡sha was in her own room. When she
 24884	heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room, flushed and
 24885	beaming with a more than cordial smile.
 24886	
 24887	BorÃ­s remembered NatÃ¡sha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining from
 24888	under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had known her
 24889	four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a different
 24890	NatÃ¡sha entered, and his face expressed rapturous astonishment. This
 24891	expression on his face pleased NatÃ¡sha.
 24892	
 24893	âWell, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?â asked the
 24894	countess.
 24895	
 24896	BorÃ­s kissed NatÃ¡shaâs hand and said that he was astonished at the
 24897	change in her.
 24898	
 24899	âHow handsome you have grown!â
 24900	
 24901	âI should think so!â replied NatÃ¡shaâs laughing eyes.
 24902	
 24903	âAnd is Papa older?â she asked.
 24904	
 24905	NatÃ¡sha sat down and, without joining in BorÃ­sâ conversation with
 24906	the countess, silently and minutely studied her childhoodâs suitor. He
 24907	felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced
 24908	at her occasionally.
 24909	
 24910	BorÃ­sâ uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all
 24911	comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This NatÃ¡sha noticed at once.
 24912	He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess, arranging
 24913	with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand
 24914	like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his
 24915	lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society, recalling
 24916	with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. It was
 24917	not accidentally, NatÃ¡sha felt, that he alluded, when speaking of the
 24918	highest aristocracy, to an ambassadorâs ball he had attended, and to
 24919	invitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.
 24920	
 24921	All this time NatÃ¡sha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her
 24922	brows. This gaze disturbed and confused BorÃ­s more and more. He looked
 24923	round more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying.
 24924	He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The
 24925	same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked
 24926	at him. After his first visit BorÃ­s said to himself that NatÃ¡sha
 24927	attracted him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that
 24928	feeling, because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would
 24929	mean ruin to his career, while to renew their former relations without
 24930	intending to marry her would be dishonorable. BorÃ­s made up his mind
 24931	to avoid meeting NatÃ¡sha, but despite that resolution he called again
 24932	a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the
 24933	RostÃ³vsâ. It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with
 24934	NatÃ¡sha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten, that in
 24935	spite of everything... she could not be his wife, that he had no means,
 24936	and they would never let her marry him. But he failed to do so and felt
 24937	awkward about entering on such an explanation. From day to day he
 24938	became more and more entangled. It seemed to her mother and SÃ³nya that
 24939	NatÃ¡sha was in love with BorÃ­s as of old. She sang him his favorite
 24940	songs, showed him her album, making him write in it, did not allow him
 24941	to allude to the past, letting it be understood how delightful was the
 24942	present; and every day he went away in a fog, without having said what
 24943	he meant to, and not knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how
 24944	it would all end. He left off visiting HÃ©lÃ¨ne and received reproachful
 24945	notes from her every day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with
 24946	the RostÃ³vs.
 24947	
 24948	
 24949	
 24950	
 24951	
 24952	CHAPTER XIII
 24953	
 24954	One night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket,
 24955	without her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing
 24956	under her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and
 24957	bowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and NatÃ¡sha, also in
 24958	a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in
 24959	curlpapers, ran in. The countessâher prayerful mood dispelledâlooked
 24960	round and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: âCan it be that
 24961	this couch will be my grave?â NatÃ¡sha, flushed and eager, seeing
 24962	her mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down, and
 24963	unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing that
 24964	her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and, rapidly
 24965	slipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her slippers and
 24966	jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave. This
 24967	couch was high, with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than
 24968	the one below. NatÃ¡sha jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled
 24969	over to the wall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled
 24970	down, raising her knees to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost
 24971	inaudibly, now covering herself up head and all, and now peeping at her
 24972	mother. The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
 24973	stern face, but seeing that NatÃ¡shaâs head was covered, she smiled
 24974	in her kind, weak way.
 24975	
 24976	âNow then, now then!â said she.
 24977	
 24978	âMamma, can we have a talk? Yes?â said NatÃ¡sha. âNow, just one on
 24979	your throat and another... thatâll do!â And seizing her mother round
 24980	the neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her mother
 24981	NatÃ¡sha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that however
 24982	she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her
 24983	or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.
 24984	
 24985	âWell, what is it tonight?â said the mother, having arranged her
 24986	pillows and waited until NatÃ¡sha, after turning over a couple of times,
 24987	had settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her arms, and
 24988	assumed a serious expression.
 24989	
 24990	These visits of NatÃ¡shaâs at night before the count returned from his
 24991	club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and daughter.
 24992	
 24993	âWhat is it tonight?âBut I have to tell you...â
 24994	
 24995	NatÃ¡sha put her hand on her motherâs mouth.
 24996	
 24997	âAbout BorÃ­s... I know,â she said seriously; âthatâs what I
 24998	have come about. Donât say itâI know. No, do tell me!â and she
 24999	removed her hand. âTell me, Mamma! Heâs nice?â
 25000	
 25001	âNatÃ¡sha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say BorÃ­s
 25002	is nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what then?...
 25003	What are you thinking about? You have quite turned his head, I can see
 25004	that....â
 25005	
 25006	As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter. NatÃ¡sha
 25007	was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
 25008	sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess
 25009	only saw her daughterâs face in profile. That face struck her by its
 25010	peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.
 25011	
 25012	NatÃ¡sha was listening and considering.
 25013	
 25014	âWell, what then?â said she.
 25015	
 25016	âYou have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You
 25017	know you canât marry him.â
 25018	
 25019	âWhy not?â said NatÃ¡sha, without changing her position.
 25020	
 25021	âBecause he is young, because he is poor, because he is a relation...
 25022	and because you yourself donât love him.â
 25023	
 25024	âHow do you know?â
 25025	
 25026	âI know. It is not right, darling!â
 25027	
 25028	âBut if I want to...â said NatÃ¡sha.
 25029	
 25030	âLeave off talking nonsense,â said the countess.
 25031	
 25032	âBut if I want to...â
 25033	
 25034	âNatÃ¡sha, I am in earnest...â
 25035	
 25036	NatÃ¡sha did not let her finish. She drew the countessâ large hand to
 25037	her, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned it
 25038	over and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between the
 25039	knuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, âJanuary, February,
 25040	March, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why donât you say anything? Speak!â
 25041	said she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter
 25042	and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to
 25043	say.
 25044	
 25045	âIt wonât do, my love! Not everyone will understand this friendship
 25046	dating from your childish days, and to see him so intimate with you may
 25047	injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us, and above all
 25048	it torments him for nothing. He may already have found a suitable and
 25049	wealthy match, and now heâs half crazy.â
 25050	
 25051	âCrazy?â repeated NatÃ¡sha.
 25052	
 25053	âIâll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin...â
 25054	
 25055	âI know! Cyril MatvÃ©ich... but he is old.â
 25056	
 25057	âHe was not always old. But this is what Iâll do, NatÃ¡sha, Iâll
 25058	have a talk with BorÃ­s. He need not come so often....â
 25059	
 25060	âWhy not, if he likes to?â
 25061	
 25062	âBecause I know it will end in nothing....â
 25063	
 25064	âHow can you know? No, Mamma, donât speak to him! What nonsense!â
 25065	said NatÃ¡sha in the tone of one being deprived of her property.
 25066	âWell, I wonât marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy
 25067	it.â NatÃ¡sha smiled and looked at her mother. âNot to marry, but
 25068	just so,â she added.
 25069	
 25070	âHow so, my pet?â
 25071	
 25072	âJust so. Thereâs no need for me to marry him. But... just so.â
 25073	
 25074	âJust so, just so,â repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she
 25075	went off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.
 25076	
 25077	âDonât laugh, stop!â cried NatÃ¡sha. âYouâre shaking the whole
 25078	bed! Youâre awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait...â
 25079	and she seized the countessâ hands and kissed a knuckle of the little
 25080	finger, saying, âJune,â and continued, kissing, âJuly, August,â
 25081	on the other hand. âBut, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you
 25082	think? Was anybody ever so much in love with you? And heâs very nice,
 25083	very, very nice. Only not quite my tasteâhe is so narrow, like the
 25084	dining-room clock.... Donât you understand? Narrow, you knowâgray,
 25085	light gray...â
 25086	
 25087	âWhat rubbish youâre talking!â said the countess.
 25088	
 25089	NatÃ¡sha continued: âDonât you really understand? Nicholas would
 25090	understand.... BezÃºkhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is
 25091	square.â
 25092	
 25093	âYou flirt with him too,â said the countess, laughing.
 25094	
 25095	âNo, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue and
 25096	red.... How can I explain it to you?â
 25097	
 25098	âLittle countess!â the countâs voice called from behind the door.
 25099	âYouâre not asleep?â NatÃ¡sha jumped up, snatched up her slippers,
 25100	and ran barefoot to her own room.
 25101	
 25102	It was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no one
 25103	could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.
 25104	
 25105	âSÃ³nya?â she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little
 25106	kitten with her enormous plait of hair. âNo, how could she? Sheâs
 25107	virtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know
 25108	anything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how
 25109	clever I am and how... charming she is,â she went on, speaking
 25110	of herself in the third person, and imagining it was some very wise
 25111	manâthe wisest and best of menâwho was saying it of her. âThere
 25112	is everything, everything in her,â continued this man. âShe is
 25113	unusually intelligent, charming... and then she is pretty, uncommonly
 25114	pretty, and agileâshe swims and rides splendidly... and her voice! One
 25115	can really say itâs a wonderful voice!â
 25116	
 25117	She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw herself
 25118	on her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately
 25119	fall asleep, called DunyÃ¡sha the maid to put out the candle, and before
 25120	DunyÃ¡sha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier
 25121	world of dreams, where everything was as light and beautiful as in
 25122	reality, and even more so because it was different.
 25123	
 25124	Next day the countess called BorÃ­s aside and had a talk with him, after
 25125	which he ceased coming to the RostÃ³vsâ.
 25126

 25131	CHAPTER XIV
 25132	
 25133	On the thirty-first of December, New Yearâs Eve, 1809 - 10 an old
 25134	grandee of Catherineâs day was giving a ball and midnight supper. The
 25135	diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.
 25136	
 25137	The grandeeâs well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with
 25138	innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance
 25139	which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but dozens of
 25140	police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch.
 25141	Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried
 25142	footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the carriages emerged men
 25143	wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine
 25144	cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them
 25145	with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize
 25146	at the entrance.
 25147	
 25148	Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the
 25149	crowd and caps were doffed.
 25150	
 25151	âThe Emperor?... No, a minister... prince... ambassador. Donât you
 25152	see the plumes?...â was whispered among the crowd.
 25153	
 25154	One person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone and
 25155	mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.
 25156	
 25157	A third of the visitors had already arrived, but the RostÃ³vs, who were
 25158	to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.
 25159	
 25160	There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the
 25161	RostÃ³v family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive, that
 25162	the dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be arranged
 25163	as it should be.
 25164	
 25165	MÃ¡rya IgnÃ¡tevna PerÃ³nskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at
 25166	the court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the
 25167	countess and piloted the provincial RostÃ³vs in Petersburg high society,
 25168	was to accompany them to the ball.
 25169	
 25170	They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten
 25171	oâclock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were
 25172	not yet dressed.
 25173	
 25174	NatÃ¡sha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight that
 25175	morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day. All
 25176	her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they
 25177	allâshe herself, Mamma, and SÃ³nyaâshould be as well dressed as
 25178	possible. SÃ³nya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands.
 25179	The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two
 25180	girls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and
 25181	their hair dressed Ã  la grecque.
 25182	
 25183	Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and
 25184	ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork
 25185	silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the
 25186	hairdressing was almost done. SÃ³nya was finishing dressing and so was
 25187	the countess, but NatÃ¡sha, who had bustled about helping them all, was
 25188	behindhand. She was still sitting before a looking-glass with a dressing
 25189	jacket thrown over her slender shoulders. SÃ³nya stood ready dressed in
 25190	the middle of the room and, pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her
 25191	dainty finger, was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went
 25192	through it.
 25193	
 25194	âThatâs not the way, thatâs not the way, SÃ³nya!â cried NatÃ¡sha
 25195	turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the
 25196	maid who was dressing it had not time to release. âThat bow is not
 25197	right. Come here!â
 25198	
 25199	SÃ³nya sat down and NatÃ¡sha pinned the ribbon on differently.
 25200	
 25201	âAllow me, Miss! I canât do it like that,â said the maid who was
 25202	holding NatÃ¡shaâs hair.
 25203	
 25204	âOh, dear! Well then, wait. Thatâs right, SÃ³nya.â
 25205	
 25206	âArenât you ready? It is nearly ten,â came the countessâ voice.
 25207	
 25208	âDirectly! Directly! And you, Mamma?â
 25209	
 25210	âI have only my cap to pin on.â
 25211	
 25212	âDonât do it without me!â called NatÃ¡sha. âYou wonât do it
 25213	right.â
 25214	
 25215	âBut itâs already ten.â
 25216	
 25217	They had decided to be at the ball by half-past ten, and NatÃ¡sha had
 25218	still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.
 25219	
 25220	When her hair was done, NatÃ¡sha, in her short petticoat from under
 25221	which her dancing shoes showed, and in her motherâs dressing jacket,
 25222	ran up to SÃ³nya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother. Turning
 25223	her motherâs head this way and that, she fastened on the cap and,
 25224	hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning
 25225	up the hem of her skirt.
 25226	
 25227	The cause of the delay was NatÃ¡shaâs skirt, which was too long.
 25228	Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
 25229	thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
 25230	countess and SÃ³nya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment
 25231	up high on one uplifted hand.
 25232	
 25233	âMÃ¡vra, quicker, darling!â
 25234	
 25235	âGive me my thimble, Miss, from there...â
 25236	
 25237	âWhenever will you be ready?â asked the count coming to the door.
 25238	âHere is some scent. PerÃ³nskaya must be tired of waiting.â
 25239	
 25240	âItâs ready, Miss,â said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze
 25241	dress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as if
 25242	by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what
 25243	she held.
 25244	
 25245	NatÃ¡sha began putting on the dress.
 25246	
 25247	âIn a minute! In a minute! Donât come in, Papa!â she cried to her
 25248	father as he opened the doorâspeaking from under the filmy skirt which
 25249	still covered her whole face.
 25250	
 25251	SÃ³nya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in. He was
 25252	wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was perfumed
 25253	and his hair pomaded.
 25254	
 25255	âOh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!â cried NatÃ¡sha, as she
 25256	stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.
 25257	
 25258	âIf you please, Miss! allow me,â said the maid, who on her knees was
 25259	pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her
 25260	mouth to the other with her tongue.
 25261	
 25262	âSay what you like,â exclaimed SÃ³nya, in a despairing voice as she
 25263	looked at NatÃ¡sha, âsay what you like, itâs still too long.â
 25264	
 25265	NatÃ¡sha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress
 25266	was too long.
 25267	
 25268	âReally, madam, it is not at all too long,â said MÃ¡vra, crawling on
 25269	her knees after her young lady.
 25270	
 25271	âWell, if itâs too long weâll tack it up... weâll tack it up
 25272	in one minute,â said the resolute DunyÃ¡sha taking a needle that was
 25273	stuck on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor,
 25274	set to work once more.
 25275	
 25276	At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in her cap
 25277	and velvet gown.
 25278	
 25279	âOo-oo, my beauty!â exclaimed the count, âshe looks better than
 25280	any of you!â
 25281	
 25282	He would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside fearing to
 25283	be rumpled.
 25284	
 25285	âMamma, your cap, more to this side,â said NatÃ¡sha. âIâll
 25286	arrange it,â and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking
 25287	up her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn
 25288	off.
 25289	
 25290	âOh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!â
 25291	
 25292	âNever mind, Iâll run it up, it wonât show,â said DunyÃ¡sha.
 25293	
 25294	âWhat a beautyâa very queen!â said the nurse as she came to the
 25295	door. âAnd SÃ³nya! They are lovely!â
 25296	
 25297	At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started.
 25298	But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.
 25299	
 25300	PerÃ³nskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she
 25301	had gone through the same process as the RostÃ³vs, but with less
 25302	flurryâfor to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was
 25303	washed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed
 25304	behind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing
 25305	room in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old
 25306	ladyâs maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the RostÃ³vsâ
 25307	servants had been.
 25308	
 25309	She praised the RostÃ³vsâ toilets. They praised her taste and toilet,
 25310	and at eleven oâclock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they
 25311	settled themselves in their carriages and drove off.
 25312	
 25313	
 25314	
 25315	
 25316	
 25317	CHAPTER XV
 25318	
 25319	NatÃ¡sha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once
 25320	had time to think of what lay before her.
 25321	
 25322	In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she
 25323	for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
 25324	the ball, in those brightly lighted roomsâwith music, flowers, dances,
 25325	the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The
 25326	prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true,
 25327	so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the
 25328	carriage. She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping
 25329	over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her
 25330	fur cloak, and, beside SÃ³nya and in front of her mother, mounted the
 25331	brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then did she
 25332	remember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to assume the majestic
 25333	air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion. But,
 25334	fortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw nothing
 25335	clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed
 25336	at her heart. She could not assume that pose, which would have made her
 25337	ridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying
 25338	with all her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that
 25339	became her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering,
 25340	also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the
 25341	landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with
 25342	diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.
 25343	
 25344	NatÃ¡sha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection
 25345	from the others. All was blended into one brilliant procession.
 25346	On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and
 25347	greetings deafened NatÃ¡sha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still
 25348	more. The host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door
 25349	for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals,
 25350	âCharmÃ© de vous voir,â * greeted the RostÃ³vs and PerÃ³nskaya in
 25351	the same manner.
 25352	
 25353	    * âDelighted to see you.â
 25354	
 25355	
 25356	The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her
 25357	black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostessâ eye
 25358	involuntarily rested longer on the slim NatÃ¡sha. She looked at her
 25359	and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as
 25360	hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden, irrecoverable
 25361	days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The host also followed
 25362	NatÃ¡sha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter.
 25363	
 25364	âCharming!â said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.
 25365	
 25366	In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting
 25367	the Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front rows
 25368	of that crowd. NatÃ¡sha heard and felt that several people were asking
 25369	about her and looking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked
 25370	her, and this observation helped to calm her.
 25371	
 25372	âThere are some like ourselves and some worse,â she thought.
 25373	
 25374	PerÃ³nskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people
 25375	at the ball.
 25376	
 25377	âThat is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,â
 25378	she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly
 25379	hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said.
 25380	
 25381	âAh, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess BezÃºkhova,â
 25382	said PerÃ³nskaya, indicating HÃ©lÃ¨ne who had just entered. âHow
 25383	lovely! She is quite equal to MÃ¡rya AntÃ³novna. See how the men, young
 25384	and old, pay court to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince
 25385	ââ is quite mad about her. But see, those two, though not
 25386	good-looking, are even more run after.â
 25387	
 25388	She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain
 25389	daughter.
 25390	
 25391	âShe is a splendid match, a millionairess,â said PerÃ³nskaya. âAnd
 25392	look, here come her suitors.â
 25393	
 25394	âThat is BezÃºkhovaâs brother, Anatole KurÃ¡gin,â she said,
 25395	indicating a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them
 25396	with head erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies.
 25397	âHeâs handsome, isnât he? I hear they will marry him to that rich
 25398	girl. But your cousin, DrubetskÃ³y, is also very attentive to her. They
 25399	say she has millions. Oh yes, thatâs the French ambassador himself!â
 25400	she replied to the countessâ inquiry about Caulaincourt. âLooks as
 25401	if he were a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming.
 25402	No one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still the
 25403	most beautiful of them all, our MÃ¡rya AntÃ³novna! And how simply she
 25404	is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles is the universal
 25405	Freemason,â she went on, indicating Pierre. âPut him beside his wife
 25406	and he looks a regular buffoon!â
 25407	
 25408	Pierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the crowd
 25409	and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he
 25410	were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through, evidently
 25411	looking for someone.
 25412	
 25413	NatÃ¡sha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, âthe
 25414	buffoon,â as PerÃ³nskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for
 25415	them, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and
 25416	introduce partners to her.
 25417	
 25418	But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark
 25419	man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window
 25420	talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. NatÃ¡sha at once
 25421	recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it was
 25422	BolkÃ³nski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger, happier, and
 25423	better-looking.
 25424	
 25425	âThereâs someone else we knowâBolkÃ³nski, do you see, Mamma?â
 25426	said NatÃ¡sha, pointing out Prince Andrew. âYou remember, he stayed a
 25427	night with us at OtrÃ¡dnoe.â
 25428	
 25429	âOh, you know him?â said PerÃ³nskaya. âI canât bear him. Il fait
 25430	Ã  prÃ©sent la pluie et le beau temps. * Heâs too proud for anything.
 25431	Takes after his father. And heâs hand in glove with SperÃ¡nski,
 25432	writing some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies!
 25433	Thereâs one talking to him and he has turned away,â she said,
 25434	pointing at him. âIâd give it to him if he treated me as he does
 25435	those ladies.â
 25436	
 25437	    * âHe is all the rage just now.â
 25438	
 25439	
 25440	
 25441	
 25442	
 25443	
 25444	CHAPTER XVI
 25445	
 25446	Suddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and then
 25447	back, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor entered to
 25448	the sounds of music that had immediately struck up. Behind him walked
 25449	his host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left
 25450	as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over. The band
 25451	played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that
 25452	had been set to it, beginning: âAlexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts
 25453	you ravish quite...â The Emperor passed on to the drawing room, the
 25454	crowd made a rush for the doors, and several persons with excited faces
 25455	hurried there and back again. Then the crowd hastily retired from
 25456	the drawing room door, at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the
 25457	hostess. A young man, looking distraught, pounced down on the ladies,
 25458	asking them to move aside. Some ladies, with faces betraying complete
 25459	forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum, pushed forward to the
 25460	detriment of their toilets. The men began to choose partners and take
 25461	their places for the polonaise.
 25462	
 25463	Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing
 25464	room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the
 25465	music. The host followed with MÃ¡rya AntÃ³novna NarÃ½shkina; then
 25466	came ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom PerÃ³nskaya
 25467	diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners
 25468	and were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the
 25469	polonaise. NatÃ¡sha felt that she would be left with her mother and
 25470	SÃ³nya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not having
 25471	been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms hanging down,
 25472	her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, and with
 25473	bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight before
 25474	her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She was
 25475	not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people whom
 25476	PerÃ³nskaya was pointing outâshe had but one thought: âIs it
 25477	possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to
 25478	dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?
 25479	They do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they
 25480	were saying, âAh, sheâs not the one Iâm after, so itâs not worth
 25481	looking at her!â No, itâs impossible,â she thought. âThey must
 25482	know how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would
 25483	enjoy dancing with me.â
 25484	
 25485	The strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable
 25486	time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to NatÃ¡shaâs ears.
 25487	She wanted to cry. PerÃ³nskaya had left them. The count was at the
 25488	other end of the room. She and the countess and SÃ³nya were standing by
 25489	themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers,
 25490	with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone. Prince Andrew
 25491	with a lady passed by, evidently not recognizing them. The handsome
 25492	Anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at
 25493	NatÃ¡sha as one looks at a wall. BorÃ­s passed them twice and each time
 25494	turned away. Berg and his wife, who were not dancing, came up to them.
 25495	
 25496	This family gathering seemed humiliating to NatÃ¡shaâas if there were
 25497	nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not
 25498	listen to or look at VÃ©ra, who was telling her something about her own
 25499	green dress.
 25500	
 25501	At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced
 25502	with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the
 25503	RostÃ³vs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they
 25504	were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the
 25505	distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor
 25506	looked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had yet begun
 25507	dancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess
 25508	BezÃºkhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and
 25509	laid it on his shoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an
 25510	adept in his art, grasping his partner firmly round her waist, with
 25511	confident deliberation started smoothly, gliding first round the edge of
 25512	the circle, then at the corner of the room he caught HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 25513	left hand and turned her, the only sound audible, apart from the
 25514	ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his
 25515	rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his partnerâs velvet
 25516	dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round. NatÃ¡sha
 25517	gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was
 25518	dancing that first turn of the waltz.
 25519	
 25520	Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing
 25521	stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the
 25522	front row of the circle not far from the RostÃ³vs. Baron Firhoff was
 25523	talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be
 25524	held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with SperÃ¡nski
 25525	and participating in the work of the legislative commission, could give
 25526	reliable information about that sitting, concerning which various rumors
 25527	were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was
 25528	gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
 25529	had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle.
 25530	
 25531	Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperorâs
 25532	presence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to
 25533	dance.
 25534	
 25535	Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.
 25536	
 25537	âYou always dance. I have a protÃ©gÃ©e, the young RostÃ³va, here. Ask
 25538	her,â he said.
 25539	
 25540	âWhere is she?â asked BolkÃ³nski. âExcuse me!â he added, turning
 25541	to the baron, âwe will finish this conversation elsewhereâat a ball
 25542	one must dance.â He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated.
 25543	The despairing, dejected expression of NatÃ¡shaâs face caught his eye.
 25544	He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her dÃ©but,
 25545	remembered her conversation at the window, and with an expression of
 25546	pleasure on his face approached Countess RostÃ³va.
 25547	
 25548	âAllow me to introduce you to my daughter,â said the countess, with
 25549	heightened color.
 25550	
 25551	âI have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess
 25552	remembers me,â said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
 25553	belying PerÃ³nskayaâs remarks about his rudeness, and approaching
 25554	NatÃ¡sha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed
 25555	his invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on
 25556	NatÃ¡shaâs face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly
 25557	brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.
 25558	
 25559	âI have long been waiting for you,â that frightened happy little
 25560	girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as
 25561	she raised her hand to Prince Andrewâs shoulder. They were the second
 25562	couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of
 25563	his day and NatÃ¡sha danced exquisitely. Her little feet in their white
 25564	satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently
 25565	of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender
 25566	bare arms and neck were not beautifulâcompared to HÃ©lÃ¨neâs her
 25567	shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But HÃ©lÃ¨ne seemed, as
 25568	it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had
 25569	scanned her person, while NatÃ¡sha was like a girl exposed for the first
 25570	time, who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured
 25571	that this was absolutely necessary.
 25572	
 25573	Prince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as
 25574	possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed
 25575	to him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked,
 25576	caused by the Emperorâs presence, he danced, and had chosen NatÃ¡sha
 25577	because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first
 25578	pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he embraced that
 25579	slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling
 25580	so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head, and he
 25581	felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood
 25582	breathing deeply and watching the other dancers.
 25583	
 25584	
 25585	
 25586	
 25587	
 25588	CHAPTER XVII
 25589	
 25590	After Prince Andrew, BorÃ­s came up to ask NatÃ¡sha for a dance, and
 25591	then the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young
 25592	men, so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous partners
 25593	to SÃ³nya, she did not cease dancing all the evening. She noticed and
 25594	saw nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did she fail to
 25595	notice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador,
 25596	and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or that Prince
 25597	So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 25598	had great success and was honored by the special attention of So-and-so,
 25599	but she did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed that he had gone
 25600	because the ball became livelier after his departure. For one of the
 25601	merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner. He
 25602	reminded her of their first encounter in the OtrÃ¡dnoe avenue, and how
 25603	she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he
 25604	had involuntarily overheard her. NatÃ¡sha blushed at that recollection
 25605	and tried to excuse herself, as if there had been something to be
 25606	ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard.
 25607	
 25608	Like all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked meeting
 25609	someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And such was
 25610	NatÃ¡sha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her
 25611	mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special care and
 25612	tenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most
 25613	unimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the middle of the
 25614	cotillion, having completed one of the figures, NatÃ¡sha, still out of
 25615	breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her. She was
 25616	tired and panting and evidently thought of declining, but immediately
 25617	put her hand gaily on the manâs shoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.
 25618	
 25619	âIâd be glad to sit beside you and rest: Iâm tired; but you see
 25620	how they keep asking me, and Iâm glad of it, Iâm happy and I love
 25621	everybody, and you and I understand it all,â and much, much more was
 25622	said in her smile. When her partner left her NatÃ¡sha ran across the
 25623	room to choose two ladies for the figure.
 25624	
 25625	âIf she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be
 25626	my wife,â said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as
 25627	he watched her. She did go first to her cousin.
 25628	
 25629	âWhat rubbish sometimes enters oneâs head!â thought Prince Andrew,
 25630	âbut what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original,
 25631	that she wonât be dancing here a month before she will be married....
 25632	Such as she are rare here,â he thought, as NatÃ¡sha, readjusting a
 25633	rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.
 25634	
 25635	When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
 25636	the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked
 25637	his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. NatÃ¡sha did not answer
 25638	at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: âHow
 25639	can you ask such a question?â
 25640	
 25641	âI have never enjoyed myself so much before!â she said, and Prince
 25642	Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
 25643	father and instantly dropped again. NatÃ¡sha was happier than she had
 25644	ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes
 25645	completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of
 25646	evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.
 25647	
 25648	At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position
 25649	his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A
 25650	deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared
 25651	over his spectacles seeing no one.
 25652	
 25653	On her way to supper NatÃ¡sha passed him.
 25654	
 25655	Pierreâs gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him.
 25656	She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own
 25657	happiness.
 25658	
 25659	âHow delightful it is, Count!â said she. âIsnât it?â
 25660	
 25661	Pierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.
 25662	
 25663	âYes, I am very glad,â he said.
 25664	
 25665	âHow can people be dissatisfied with anything?â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 25666	âEspecially such a capital fellow as BezÃºkhov!â In NatÃ¡shaâs
 25667	eyes all the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid
 25668	people, loving one another; none of them capable of injuring
 25669	anotherâand so they ought all to be happy.
 25670	
 25671	
 25672	
 25673	
 25674	
 25675	CHAPTER XVIII
 25676	
 25677	Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell
 25678	on it long. âYes, it was a very brilliant ball,â and then... âYes,
 25679	that little RostÃ³va is very charming. Thereâs something fresh,
 25680	original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.â That
 25681	was all he thought about yesterdayâs ball, and after his morning tea
 25682	he set to work.
 25683	
 25684	But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work
 25685	and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work, as he
 25686	often did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.
 25687	
 25688	The visitor was BÃ­tski, who served on various committees, frequented
 25689	all the societies in Petersburg, and was a passionate devotee of the new
 25690	ideas and of SperÃ¡nski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmongerâone of
 25691	those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to
 25692	the fashion, but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest
 25693	partisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince
 25694	Andrewâs room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking. He
 25695	had just heard particulars of that morningâs sitting of the Council
 25696	of State opened by the Emperor, and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The
 25697	Emperorâs speech had been extraordinary. It had been a speech such as
 25698	only constitutional monarchs deliver. âThe Sovereign plainly said
 25699	that the Council and Senate are estates of the realm, he said that the
 25700	government must rest not on authority but on secure bases. The Emperor
 25701	said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts
 25702	published,â recounted BÃ­tski, emphasizing certain words and opening
 25703	his eyes significantly.
 25704	
 25705	âAh, yes! Todayâs events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our
 25706	history,â he concluded.
 25707	
 25708	Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of
 25709	State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached
 25710	such importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had
 25711	taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He
 25712	listened with quiet irony to BÃ­tskiâs enthusiastic account of it. A
 25713	very simple thought occurred to him: âWhat does it matter to me or to
 25714	BÃ­tski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that
 25715	make me any happier or better?â
 25716	
 25717	And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince
 25718	Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that
 25719	evening at SperÃ¡nskiâs, âwith only a few friends,â as the host
 25720	had said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate
 25721	home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince
 25722	Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen SperÃ¡nski in his domestic
 25723	surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.
 25724	
 25725	At the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house SperÃ¡nski
 25726	owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room of this small
 25727	house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a
 25728	monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly
 25729	gathering of SperÃ¡nskiâs intimate acquaintances already assembled
 25730	at five oâclock. There were no ladies present except SperÃ¡nskiâs
 25731	little daughter (long-faced like her father) and her governess. The
 25732	other guests were Gervais, MagnÃ­tski, and StolÃ½pin. While still in
 25733	the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato
 25734	laughâa laugh such as one hears on the stage. Someoneâit sounded
 25735	like SperÃ¡nskiâwas distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew
 25736	had never before heard SperÃ¡nskiâs famous laugh, and this ringing,
 25737	high-pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him.
 25738	
 25739	He entered the dining room. The whole company were standing between two
 25740	windows at a small table laid with hors-dâoeuvres. SperÃ¡nski, wearing
 25741	a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still
 25742	the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
 25743	the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His
 25744	guests surrounded him. MagnÃ­tski, addressing himself to SperÃ¡nski,
 25745	was relating an anecdote, and SperÃ¡nski was laughing in advance at
 25746	what MagnÃ­tski was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room
 25747	MagnÃ­tskiâs words were again crowned by laughter. StolÃ½pin gave
 25748	a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais
 25749	laughed softly with a hissing chuckle, and SperÃ¡nski in a high-pitched
 25750	staccato manner.
 25751	
 25752	Still laughing, SperÃ¡nski held out his soft white hand to Prince
 25753	Andrew.
 25754	
 25755	âVery pleased to see you, Prince,â he said. âOne moment...â he
 25756	went on, turning to MagnÃ­tski and interrupting his story. âWe have
 25757	agreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about
 25758	business!â and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.
 25759	
 25760	Prince Andrew looked at the laughing SperÃ¡nski with astonishment,
 25761	regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not
 25762	SperÃ¡nski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared
 25763	mysterious and fascinating in SperÃ¡nski suddenly became plain and
 25764	unattractive.
 25765	
 25766	At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to
 25767	consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before MagnÃ­tski
 25768	had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something
 25769	still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state
 25770	service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in this
 25771	company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted
 25772	that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored
 25773	ridicule. SperÃ¡nski related how at the Council that morning a deaf
 25774	dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too.
 25775	Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable for the
 25776	stupidity of everybody concerned. StolÃ½pin, stuttering, broke into
 25777	the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
 25778	under the former order of thingsâthreatening to give a serious turn
 25779	to the conversation. MagnÃ­tski starting quizzing StolÃ½pin about his
 25780	vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its
 25781	former lively tone.
 25782	
 25783	Evidently SperÃ¡nski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement
 25784	in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried
 25785	to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince
 25786	Andrew mirthless and tiresome. SperÃ¡nskiâs high-pitched voice struck
 25787	him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false
 25788	note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper
 25789	on the spirits of the company, but no one took any notice of his being
 25790	out of harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very gay.
 25791	
 25792	He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were
 25793	tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could
 25794	not jest with them.
 25795	
 25796	There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and
 25797	might have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the
 25798	salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed.
 25799	
 25800	After dinner SperÃ¡nskiâs daughter and her governess rose. He patted
 25801	the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture,
 25802	too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.
 25803	
 25804	The men remained at table over their portâEnglish fashion. In the
 25805	midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleonâs Spanish
 25806	affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to
 25807	express a contrary opinion. SperÃ¡nski smiled and, with an evident wish
 25808	to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a
 25809	story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few
 25810	moments all were silent.
 25811	
 25812	Having sat some time at table, SperÃ¡nski corked a bottle of wine and,
 25813	remarking, âNowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,â passed
 25814	it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly
 25815	went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed
 25816	to SperÃ¡nski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left
 25817	the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse
 25818	sensibly and quietly with one another.
 25819	
 25820	âNow for the recitation!â said SperÃ¡nski on returning from
 25821	his study. âA wonderful talent!â he said to Prince Andrew, and
 25822	MagnÃ­tski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous
 25823	verses in French which he had composed about various well-known
 25824	Petersburg people. He was interrupted several times by applause. When
 25825	the verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to SperÃ¡nski and took
 25826	his leave.
 25827	
 25828	âWhere are you off to so early?â asked SperÃ¡nski.
 25829	
 25830	âI promised to go to a reception.â
 25831	
 25832	They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike,
 25833	impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have
 25834	expected anything from SperÃ¡nski and from any of his own activities
 25835	connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what
 25836	SperÃ¡nski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince
 25837	Andrewâs ears long after he had left the house.
 25838	
 25839	When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in
 25840	Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He
 25841	recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project
 25842	of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they
 25843	were trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor
 25844	one, had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought
 25845	of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered
 25846	how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and
 25847	procedure was discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and
 25848	promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded. He
 25849	recalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had
 25850	translated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian,
 25851	and he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself
 25852	BoguchÃ¡rovo, his occupations in the country, his journey to RyazÃ¡n;
 25853	he remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally
 25854	applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he
 25855	felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless
 25856	work.
 25857	
 25858	
 25859	
 25860	
 25861	
 25862	CHAPTER XIX
 25863	
 25864	Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before,
 25865	and among them at the RostÃ³vsâ with whom he had renewed acquaintance
 25866	at the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the
 25867	call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a
 25868	pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.
 25869	
 25870	NatÃ¡sha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a dark-blue
 25871	house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in
 25872	her ball dress. She and all the RostÃ³v family welcomed him as an old
 25873	friend, simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly
 25874	judged severely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple,
 25875	and kindly people. The old countâs hospitality and good nature, which
 25876	struck one especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such
 25877	that Prince Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. âYes,â
 25878	he thought, âthey are capital people, who of course have not the
 25879	slightest idea what a treasure they possess in NatÃ¡sha; but they are
 25880	kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly
 25881	poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!â
 25882	
 25883	In NatÃ¡sha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
 25884	alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,
 25885	that in the OtrÃ¡dnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night
 25886	had already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no
 25887	longer and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it
 25888	found in it a new enjoyment.
 25889	
 25890	After dinner NatÃ¡sha, at Prince Andrewâs request, went to the
 25891	clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking
 25892	to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased
 25893	speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought
 25894	impossible for him. He looked at NatÃ¡sha as she sang, and something new
 25895	and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad.
 25896	He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep. What
 25897	about? His former love? The little princess? His disillusionments?...
 25898	His hopes for the future?... Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden,
 25899	vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great
 25900	and illimitable within him and that limited and material something that
 25901	he, and even she, was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him
 25902	while she sang.
 25903	
 25904	As soon as NatÃ¡sha had finished she went up to him and asked how he
 25905	liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling that
 25906	she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he
 25907	liked her singing as he liked everything she did.
 25908	
 25909	Prince Andrew left the RostÃ³vsâ late in the evening. He went to bed
 25910	from habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having lit his
 25911	candle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again not at all
 25912	troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he
 25913	had stepped out of a stuffy room into Godâs own fresh air. It did not
 25914	enter his head that he was in love with NatÃ¡sha; he was not thinking
 25915	about her, but only picturing her to himself, and in consequence all
 25916	life appeared in a new light. âWhy do I strive, why do I toil in this
 25917	narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open
 25918	to me?â said he to himself. And for the first time for a very long
 25919	while he began making happy plans for the future. He decided that he
 25920	must attend to his sonâs education by finding a tutor and putting
 25921	the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go
 25922	abroad, and see England, Switzerland and Italy. âI must use my freedom
 25923	while I feel so much strength and youth in me,â he said to himself.
 25924	âPierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of
 25925	happiness in order to be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead
 25926	bury their dead, but while one has life one must live and be happy!â
 25927	thought he.
 25928	
 25929	
 25930	
 25931	
 25932	
 25933	CHAPTER XX
 25934	
 25935	One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in
 25936	Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate
 25937	brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his
 25938	temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.
 25939	
 25940	âI have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she
 25941	could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate
 25942	with you,â he said with a smile.
 25943	
 25944	âWhat is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.â
 25945	
 25946	âI have now quite settled in my new rooms, Countâ (Berg said
 25947	this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be
 25948	agreeable), âand so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own
 25949	and my wifeâs friends.â (He smiled still more pleasantly.) âI
 25950	wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea
 25951	and to supper.â
 25952	
 25953	Only Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, considering the society of such people as the
 25954	Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation.
 25955	Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small
 25956	but select company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though
 25957	he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared
 25958	to run into some expense for the sake of good societyâthat Pierre
 25959	could not refuse, and promised to come.
 25960	
 25961	âBut donât be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten
 25962	minutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is
 25963	coming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you will
 25964	do me the favor.â
 25965	
 25966	Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the
 25967	Bergsâ house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.
 25968	
 25969	Having prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready
 25970	for their guestsâ arrival.
 25971	
 25972	In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures
 25973	and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up in
 25974	his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always
 25975	could and should be acquainted with people above one, because only then
 25976	does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.
 25977	
 25978	âYou can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I
 25979	managed from my first promotion.â (Berg measured his life not by years
 25980	but by promotions.) âMy comrades are still nobodies, while I am only
 25981	waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to
 25982	be your husband.â (He rose and kissed VÃ©raâs hand, and on the way
 25983	to her straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) âAnd
 25984	how have I obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my
 25985	aquaintances. It goes without saying that one must be conscientious and
 25986	methodical.â
 25987	
 25988	Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and
 25989	paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
 25990	woman who could not understand all that constitutes a manâs dignity,
 25991	what it was ein Mann zu sein. * VÃ©ra at the same time smiling with a
 25992	sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the
 25993	same understood life wrongly, as according to VÃ©ra all men did. Berg,
 25994	judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. VÃ©ra, judging
 25995	only by her husband and generalizing from that observation, supposed
 25996	that all men, though they understand nothing and are conceited and
 25997	selfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.
 25998	
 25999	    * To be a man.
 26000	
 26001	Berg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her lace
 26002	fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the
 26003	lips.
 26004	
 26005	âThe only thing is, we mustnât have children too soon,â he
 26006	continued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.
 26007	
 26008	âYes,â answered VÃ©ra, âI donât at all want that. We must live
 26009	for society.â
 26010	
 26011	âPrincess YusÃºpova wore one exactly like this,â said Berg, pointing
 26012	to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.
 26013	
 26014	Just then Count BezÃºkhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced at one
 26015	another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming
 26016	the honor of this visit.
 26017	
 26018	âThis is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,â thought
 26019	Berg. âThis is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.â
 26020	
 26021	âBut please donât interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,â
 26022	said VÃ©ra, âbecause I know what interests each of them and what to
 26023	say to different people.â
 26024	
 26025	Berg smiled again.
 26026	
 26027	âIt canât be helped: men must sometimes have masculine
 26028	conversation,â said he.
 26029	
 26030	They received Pierre in their small, new drawing room, where it was
 26031	impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,
 26032	neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that
 26033	Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
 26034	or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully
 26035	undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle
 26036	the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
 26037	chair for himself, and Berg and VÃ©ra immediately began their evening
 26038	party, interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
 26039	guest.
 26040	
 26041	VÃ©ra, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be
 26042	entertained with conversation about the French embassy, at once began
 26043	accordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation was
 26044	required, interrupted his wifeâs remarks and touched on the question
 26045	of the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the general
 26046	subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take
 26047	part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them.
 26048	Though the conversation was very incoherent and VÃ©ra was angry at the
 26049	intrusion of the masculine element, both husband and wife felt with
 26050	satisfaction that, even if only one guest was present, their evening had
 26051	begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party
 26052	with its talk, tea, and lighted candles.
 26053	
 26054	Before long BorÃ­s, Bergâs old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of
 26055	condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and VÃ©ra. After
 26056	BorÃ­s came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the
 26057	RostÃ³vs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
 26058	evening parties. Berg and VÃ©ra could not repress their smiles of
 26059	satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room,
 26060	at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of dresses, and the
 26061	bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody always has it,
 26062	especially so the general, who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the
 26063	shoulder, and with parental authority superintended the setting out of
 26064	the table for boston. The general sat down by Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, who
 26065	was next to himself the most important guest. The old people sat with
 26066	the old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea table, on
 26067	which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
 26068	the Panins had at their party. Everything was just as it was everywhere
 26069	else.
 26070

 26075	CHAPTER XXI
 26076	
 26077	Pierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston
 26078	with Count RostÃ³v, the general, and the colonel. At the card table he
 26079	happened to be directly facing NatÃ¡sha, and was struck by a curious
 26080	change that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and not
 26081	only less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from plainness by
 26082	her look of gentle indifference to everything around.
 26083	
 26084	âWhatâs the matter with her?â thought Pierre, glancing at her.
 26085	She was sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without
 26086	looking at him, made some reply to BorÃ­s who sat down beside her. After
 26087	playing out a whole suit and to his partnerâs delight taking five
 26088	tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had
 26089	entered the room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again at
 26090	NatÃ¡sha.
 26091	
 26092	âWhat has happened to her?â he asked himself with still greater
 26093	surprise.
 26094	
 26095	Prince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her with a
 26096	look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was looking up
 26097	at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing. And
 26098	the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again
 26099	alight in her. She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had
 26100	again become what she had been at the ball.
 26101	
 26102	Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and
 26103	youthful expression in his friendâs face.
 26104	
 26105	Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with
 26106	his back to NatÃ¡sha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six
 26107	rubbers he watched her and his friend.
 26108	
 26109	âSomething very important is happening between them,â thought
 26110	Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and
 26111	made him neglect the game.
 26112	
 26113	After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing
 26114	like that, and Pierre was released. NatÃ¡sha on one side was talking
 26115	with SÃ³nya and BorÃ­s, and VÃ©ra with a subtle smile was saying
 26116	something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking
 26117	whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. VÃ©ra, having
 26118	noticed Prince Andrewâs attentions to NatÃ¡sha, decided that at a
 26119	party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were
 26120	absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone,
 26121	began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her
 26122	sister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to
 26123	be, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact.
 26124	
 26125	When Pierre went up to them he noticed that VÃ©ra was being carried away
 26126	by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a
 26127	thing that rarely happened with him.
 26128	
 26129	âWhat do you think?â VÃ©ra was saying with an arch smile. âYou are
 26130	so discerning, Prince, and understand peopleâs characters so well at
 26131	a glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her
 26132	attachments? Could she, like other womenâ (VÃ©ra meant herself),
 26133	âlove a man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is what
 26134	I consider true love. What do you think, Prince?â
 26135	
 26136	âI know your sister too little,â replied Prince Andrew, with a
 26137	sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, âto
 26138	be able to solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed that
 26139	the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be,â
 26140	he added, and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.
 26141	
 26142	âYes, that is true, Prince. In our days,â continued
 26143	VÃ©raâmentioning âour daysâ as people of limited intelligence are
 26144	fond of doing, imagining that they have discovered and appraised the
 26145	peculiarities of âour daysâ and that human characteristics change
 26146	with the timesââin our days a girl has so much freedom that the
 26147	pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her. And it must
 26148	be confessed that Natalie is very susceptible.â This return to
 26149	the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with
 26150	discomfort: he was about to rise, but VÃ©ra continued with a still more
 26151	subtle smile:
 26152	
 26153	âI think no one has been more courted than she,â she went on, âbut
 26154	till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you know,
 26155	Count,â she said to Pierre, âeven our dear cousin BorÃ­s, who,
 26156	between ourselves, was very far gone in the land of tenderness...â
 26157	(alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time).
 26158	
 26159	Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.
 26160	
 26161	âYou are friendly with BorÃ­s, arenât you?â asked VÃ©ra.
 26162	
 26163	âYes, I know him....â
 26164	
 26165	âI expect he has told you of his childish love for NatÃ¡sha?â
 26166	
 26167	âOh, there was childish love?â suddenly asked Prince Andrew,
 26168	blushing unexpectedly.
 26169	
 26170	âYes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le
 26171	cousinage est un dangereux voisinage. * Donât you think so?â
 26172	
 26173	    * âCousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.â
 26174	
 26175	
 26176	âOh, undoubtedly!â said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural
 26177	liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful
 26178	with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these
 26179	jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.
 26180	
 26181	âWell?â asked Pierre, seeing his friendâs strange animation with
 26182	surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on NatÃ¡sha as he rose.
 26183	
 26184	âI must... I must have a talk with you,â said Prince Andrew. âYou
 26185	know that pair of womenâs gloves?â (He referred to the Masonic
 26186	gloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he
 26187	loved.) âI... but no, I will talk to you later on,â and with a
 26188	strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince
 26189	Andrew approached NatÃ¡sha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how
 26190	Prince Andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied.
 26191	
 26192	But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he
 26193	should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
 26194	the affairs in Spain.
 26195	
 26196	Berg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his face.
 26197	The party was very successful and quite like other parties he had
 26198	seen. Everything was similar: the ladiesâ subtle talk, the cards, the
 26199	general raising his voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea
 26200	cakes; only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening
 26201	parties he wished to imitate. They had not yet had a loud conversation
 26202	among the men and a dispute about something important and clever. Now
 26203	the general had begun such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.
 26204	
 26205	
 26206	
 26207	
 26208	
 26209	CHAPTER XXII
 26210	
 26211	Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with the
 26212	RostÃ³vs and spent the rest of the day there.
 26213	
 26214	Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came, and
 26215	without concealing it he tried to be with NatÃ¡sha all day. Not only in
 26216	the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured NatÃ¡sha, but in the
 26217	whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was
 26218	bound to happen. The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes
 26219	at Prince Andrew when he talked to NatÃ¡sha and timidly started some
 26220	artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way.
 26221	SÃ³nya was afraid to leave NatÃ¡sha and afraid of being in the way when
 26222	she was with them. NatÃ¡sha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when
 26223	she remained alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by
 26224	his timidity. She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
 26225	not bring himself to do so.
 26226	
 26227	In the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to
 26228	NatÃ¡sha and whispered: âWell, what?â
 26229	
 26230	âMamma! For heavenâs sake donât ask me anything now! One canât
 26231	talk about that,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 26232	
 26233	But all the same that night NatÃ¡sha, now agitated and now frightened,
 26234	lay a long time in her motherâs bed gazing straight before her. She
 26235	told her how he had complimented her, how he told her he was going
 26236	abroad, asked her where they were going to spend the summer, and then
 26237	how he had asked her about BorÃ­s.
 26238	
 26239	âBut such a... such a... never happened to me before!â she said.
 26240	âOnly I feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when Iâm
 26241	with him. What does that mean? Does it mean that itâs the real thing?
 26242	Yes? Mamma, are you asleep?â
 26243	
 26244	âNo, my love; I am frightened myself,â answered her mother. âNow
 26245	go!â
 26246	
 26247	âAll the same I shanât sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy!
 26248	Mummy! such a thing never happened to me before,â she said, surprised
 26249	and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. âAnd could we
 26250	ever have thought!...â
 26251	
 26252	It seemed to NatÃ¡sha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew
 26253	at OtrÃ¡dnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she feared
 26254	this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had
 26255	then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding
 26256	him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.
 26257	
 26258	âAnd it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg
 26259	while we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that
 26260	ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this!
 26261	Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.â
 26262	
 26263	âWhat else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...â
 26264	said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew
 26265	had written in NatÃ¡shaâs album.
 26266	
 26267	âMamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?â
 26268	
 26269	âDonât, NatÃ¡sha! Pray to God. âMarriages are made in
 26270	heaven,ââ said her mother.
 26271	
 26272	âDarling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!â cried NatÃ¡sha,
 26273	shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.
 26274	
 26275	At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him
 26276	of his love for NatÃ¡sha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.
 26277	
 26278	That day Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne had a reception at her house. The French
 26279	ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of
 26280	late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and
 26281	gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and
 26282	struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.
 26283	
 26284	Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression
 26285	and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of
 26286	his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a
 26287	gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel
 26288	oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity
 26289	of all things human came to him oftener than before. At the same time
 26290	the feeling he had noticed between his protÃ©gÃ©e NatÃ¡sha and Prince
 26291	Andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position
 26292	and his friendâs. He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife,
 26293	and about NatÃ¡sha and Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him
 26294	insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what?
 26295	presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic
 26296	labors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward
 26297	midnight, after he had left the countessâ apartments, he was sitting
 26298	upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction
 26299	of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
 26300	with tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.
 26301	
 26302	âAh, itâs you!â said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air.
 26303	âAnd I, you see, am hard at it.â He pointed to his manuscript book
 26304	with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy
 26305	people look at their work.
 26306	
 26307	Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on
 26308	his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,
 26309	smiled at him with the egotism of joy.
 26310	
 26311	âWell, dear heart,â said he, âI wanted to tell you about it
 26312	yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything
 26313	like it before. I am in love, my friend!â
 26314	
 26315	Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on
 26316	the sofa beside Prince Andrew.
 26317	
 26318	âWith NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va, yes?â said he.
 26319	
 26320	âYes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,
 26321	but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and
 26322	suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in
 26323	the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I canât
 26324	live without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why
 26325	donât you speak?â
 26326	
 26327	âI? I? What did I tell you?â said Pierre suddenly, rising and
 26328	beginning to pace up and down the room. âI always thought it.... That
 26329	girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend,
 26330	I entreat you, donât philosophize, donât doubt, marry, marry,
 26331	marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.â
 26332	
 26333	âBut what of her?â
 26334	
 26335	âShe loves you.â
 26336	
 26337	âDonât talk rubbish...â said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking
 26338	into Pierreâs eyes.
 26339	
 26340	âShe does, I know,â Pierre cried fiercely.
 26341	
 26342	âBut do listen,â returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the
 26343	arm. âDo you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to
 26344	someone.â
 26345	
 26346	âWell, go on, go on. I am very glad,â said Pierre, and his face
 26347	really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince
 26348	Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite
 26349	a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his
 26350	disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind
 26351	to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul. Now he
 26352	boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future, said he could not
 26353	sacrifice his own happiness to his fatherâs caprice, and spoke of how
 26354	he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her,
 26355	or would do without his consent; then he marveled at the feeling that
 26356	had mastered him as at something strange, apart from and independent of
 26357	himself.
 26358	
 26359	âI should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of
 26360	such love,â said Prince Andrew. âIt is not at all the same feeling
 26361	that I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two
 26362	halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the
 26363	other half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and
 26364	darkness....â
 26365	
 26366	âDarkness and gloom,â reiterated Pierre: âyes, yes, I understand
 26367	that.â
 26368	
 26369	âI cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very
 26370	happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.â
 26371	
 26372	âYes, yes,â Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched
 26373	and sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrewâs lot
 26374	appeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own.
 26375	
 26376	
 26377	
 26378	
 26379	
 26380	CHAPTER XXIII
 26381	
 26382	Prince Andrew needed his fatherâs consent to his marriage, and to
 26383	obtain this he started for the country next day.
 26384	
 26385	His father received his sonâs communication with external composure,
 26386	but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to
 26387	alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life
 26388	was already ending. âIf only they would let me end my days as I want
 26389	to,â thought the old man, âthen they might do as they please.â
 26390	With his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for
 26391	important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole
 26392	matter.
 26393	
 26394	In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards
 26395	birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young
 26396	as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress
 26397	on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would
 26398	be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. âFourthly and finally,â
 26399	the father said, looking ironically at his son, âI beg you to put it
 26400	off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for
 26401	a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion or
 26402	obstinacyâas you pleaseâis still as great, marry! And thatâs my
 26403	last word on it. Mind, the last...â concluded the prince, in a tone
 26404	which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision.
 26405	
 26406	Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or
 26407	his fiancÃ©eâs, would not stand a yearâs test, or that he (the old
 26408	prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his
 26409	fatherâs wishâto propose, and postpone the wedding for a year.
 26410	
 26411	Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the RostÃ³vs,
 26412	Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg.
 26413	
 26414	
 26415	Next day after her talk with her mother NatÃ¡sha expected BolkÃ³nski all
 26416	day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same.
 26417	Pierre did not come either and NatÃ¡sha, not knowing that Prince Andrew
 26418	had gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.
 26419	
 26420	Three weeks passed in this way. NatÃ¡sha had no desire to go out
 26421	anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and
 26422	listless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the
 26423	evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her
 26424	that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and
 26425	pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity
 26426	intensified her misery.
 26427	
 26428	Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began
 26429	to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why
 26430	it is being punished.
 26431	
 26432	The countess began to soothe NatÃ¡sha, who after first listening to her
 26433	motherâs words, suddenly interrupted her:
 26434	
 26435	âLeave off, Mamma! I donât think, and donât want to think about
 26436	it! He just came and then left off, left off....â
 26437	
 26438	Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went
 26439	on quietly:
 26440	
 26441	âAnd I donât at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I
 26442	have now become quite calm, quite calm.â
 26443	
 26444	The day after this conversation NatÃ¡sha put on the old dress which
 26445	she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
 26446	mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had
 26447	abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to
 26448	the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and
 26449	began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise
 26450	she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that
 26451	particularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not
 26452	expected it) to the charm of the notes reverberating, filling the
 26453	whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt
 26454	cheerful. âWhatâs the good of making so much of it? Things are nice
 26455	as it is,â she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the
 26456	room, not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with
 26457	each step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair
 26458	of shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of
 26459	the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice. Passing a
 26460	mirror she glanced into it. âThere, thatâs me!â the expression of
 26461	her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. âWell, and very
 26462	nice too! I need nobody.â
 26463	
 26464	A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she
 26465	would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her
 26466	walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite moodâlove of,
 26467	and delight in, herself. âHow charming that NatÃ¡sha is!â she said
 26468	again, speaking as some third, collective, male person. âPretty,
 26469	a good voice, young, and in nobodyâs way if only they leave her in
 26470	peace.â But however much they left her in peace she could not now be
 26471	at peace, and immediately felt this.
 26472	
 26473	In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, âAt home?â and
 26474	then footsteps were heard. NatÃ¡sha was looking at the mirror, but did
 26475	not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw
 26476	herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though
 26477	she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.
 26478	
 26479	Pale and agitated, NatÃ¡sha ran into the drawing room.
 26480	
 26481	âMamma! BolkÃ³nski has come!â she said. âMamma, it is awful, it is
 26482	unbearable! I donât want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...â
 26483	
 26484	Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with
 26485	an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw NatÃ¡sha his face
 26486	brightened. He kissed the countessâ hand and NatÃ¡shaâs, and sat
 26487	down beside the sofa.
 26488	
 26489	âIt is long since we had the pleasure...â began the countess,
 26490	but Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,
 26491	obviously in haste to say what he had to.
 26492	
 26493	âI have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my
 26494	fatherâs. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only
 26495	got back last night,â he said glancing at NatÃ¡sha; âI want to have
 26496	a talk with you, Countess,â he added after a momentâs pause.
 26497	
 26498	The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.
 26499	
 26500	âI am at your disposal,â she murmured.
 26501	
 26502	NatÃ¡sha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:
 26503	something gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared
 26504	straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.
 26505	
 26506	âAt once? This instant!... No, it canât be!â she thought.
 26507	
 26508	Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not
 26509	mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be decided.
 26510	
 26511	âGo, NatÃ¡sha! I will call you,â said the countess in a whisper.
 26512	
 26513	NatÃ¡sha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at
 26514	her mother and went out.
 26515	
 26516	âI have come, Countess, to ask for your daughterâs hand,â said
 26517	Prince Andrew.
 26518	
 26519	The countessâ face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.
 26520	
 26521	âYour offer...â she began at last sedately. He remained silent,
 26522	looking into her eyes. âYour offer...â (she grew confused) âis
 26523	agreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I
 26524	hope... but it will depend on her....â
 26525	
 26526	âI will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to
 26527	me?â said Prince Andrew.
 26528	
 26529	âYes,â replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with
 26530	a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his
 26531	forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a
 26532	son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. âI
 26533	am sure my husband will consent,â said the countess, âbut your
 26534	father...â
 26535	
 26536	âMy father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express
 26537	condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
 26538	year. And I wished to tell you of that,â said Prince Andrew.
 26539	
 26540	âIt is true that NatÃ¡sha is still young, butâso long as that?...â
 26541	
 26542	âIt is unavoidable,â said Prince Andrew with a sigh.
 26543	
 26544	âI will send her to you,â said the countess, and left the room.
 26545	
 26546	âLord have mercy upon us!â she repeated while seeking her daughter.
 26547	
 26548	SÃ³nya said that NatÃ¡sha was in her bedroom. NatÃ¡sha was sitting on
 26549	the bed, pale and dry-eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering
 26550	something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped
 26551	up and flew to her.
 26552	
 26553	âWell, Mamma?... Well?...â
 26554	
 26555	âGo, go to him. He is asking for your hand,â said the countess,
 26556	coldly it seemed to NatÃ¡sha. âGo... go,â said the mother, sadly and
 26557	reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.
 26558	
 26559	NatÃ¡sha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she
 26560	came in and saw him she paused. âIs it possible that this stranger
 26561	has now become everything to me?â she asked herself, and immediately
 26562	answered, âYes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than
 26563	everything in the world.â Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast
 26564	eyes.
 26565	
 26566	âI have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?â
 26567	
 26568	He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of
 26569	her face. Her face said: âWhy ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know?
 26570	Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?â
 26571	
 26572	She drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.
 26573	
 26574	âDo you love me?â
 26575	
 26576	âYes, yes!â NatÃ¡sha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed
 26577	loudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.
 26578	
 26579	âWhat is it? Whatâs the matter?â
 26580	
 26581	âOh, I am so happy!â she replied, smiled through her tears, bent
 26582	over closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether
 26583	she might, and then kissed him.
 26584	
 26585	Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find
 26586	in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly
 26587	changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
 26588	desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear
 26589	at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of
 26590	the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present feeling, though
 26591	not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious.
 26592	
 26593	âDid your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?â asked
 26594	Prince Andrew, still looking into her eyes.
 26595	
 26596	âIs it possible that Iâthe âchit of a girl,â as everybody called
 26597	me,â thought NatÃ¡shaââis it possible that I am now to be the
 26598	wife and the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father
 26599	looks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no
 26600	more playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies
 26601	a responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask
 26602	me?â
 26603	
 26604	âNo,â she replied, but she had not understood his question.
 26605	
 26606	âForgive me!â he said. âBut you are so young, and I have already
 26607	been through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know
 26608	yourself.â
 26609	
 26610	NatÃ¡sha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to
 26611	take in the meaning of his words.
 26612	
 26613	âHard as this year which delays my happiness will be,â continued
 26614	Prince Andrew, âit will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask
 26615	you to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall
 26616	remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should
 26617	you come to love...â said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.
 26618	
 26619	âWhy do you say that?â NatÃ¡sha interrupted him. âYou know that
 26620	from the very day you first came to OtrÃ¡dnoe I have loved you,â she
 26621	cried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.
 26622	
 26623	âIn a year you will learn to know yourself....â
 26624	
 26625	âA whole year!â NatÃ¡sha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that
 26626	the marriage was to be postponed for a year. âBut why a year? Why a
 26627	year?...â
 26628	
 26629	Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.
 26630	NatÃ¡sha did not hear him.
 26631	
 26632	âAnd canât it be helped?â she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply,
 26633	but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.
 26634	
 26635	âItâs awful! Oh, itâs awful! awful!â NatÃ¡sha suddenly cried,
 26636	and again burst into sobs. âI shall die, waiting a year: itâs
 26637	impossible, itâs awful!â She looked into her loverâs face and saw
 26638	in it a look of commiseration and perplexity.
 26639	
 26640	âNo, no! Iâll do anything!â she said, suddenly checking her tears.
 26641	âI am so happy.â
 26642	
 26643	The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple
 26644	their blessing.
 26645	
 26646	From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the RostÃ³vsâ as
 26647	NatÃ¡shaâs affianced lover.
 26648	
 26649	
 26650	
 26651	
 26652	
 26653	CHAPTER XXIV
 26654	
 26655	No betrothal ceremony took place and NatÃ¡shaâs engagement to
 26656	BolkÃ³nski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said
 26657	that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole
 26658	burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever, but
 26659	that he did not wish to bind NatÃ¡sha and gave her perfect freedom. If
 26660	after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full
 26661	right to reject him. Naturally neither NatÃ¡sha nor her parents wished
 26662	to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came every day to the
 26663	RostÃ³vsâ, but did not behave to NatÃ¡sha as an affianced lover: he
 26664	did not use the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her
 26665	hand. After their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural
 26666	relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each
 26667	other till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other
 26668	when as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves
 26669	now quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and
 26670	sincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with
 26671	Prince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time
 26672	NatÃ¡sha trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them
 26673	all that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all
 26674	of them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be.
 26675	After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in
 26676	his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he took his part.
 26677	He could talk about rural economy with the count, fashions with the
 26678	countess and NatÃ¡sha, and about albums and fancywork with SÃ³nya.
 26679	Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence
 26680	expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the evident
 26681	omens there had been of it: Prince Andrewâs coming to OtrÃ¡dnoe and
 26682	their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between NatÃ¡sha and Prince
 26683	Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrewâs
 26684	encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents betokening
 26685	that it had to be.
 26686	
 26687	In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
 26688	accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting
 26689	together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and
 26690	go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely
 26691	spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to
 26692	speak of it. NatÃ¡sha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she
 26693	constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince
 26694	Andrew blushed, as he often did nowâNatÃ¡sha particularly liked it in
 26695	himâand said that his son would not live with them.
 26696	
 26697	âWhy not?â asked NatÃ¡sha in a frightened tone.
 26698	
 26699	âI cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...â
 26700	
 26701	âHow I should have loved him!â said NatÃ¡sha, immediately guessing
 26702	his thought; âbut I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding
 26703	fault with us.â
 26704	
 26705	Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask
 26706	his advice about PÃ©tyaâs education or Nicholasâ service. The
 26707	old countess sighed as she looked at them; SÃ³nya was always getting
 26708	frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for
 26709	leaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew
 26710	spoke (he could tell a story very well), NatÃ¡sha listened to him
 26711	with pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed
 26712	attentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in perplexity:
 26713	âWhat does he look for in me? He is trying to discover something by
 26714	looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?â Sometimes
 26715	she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and
 26716	then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed.
 26717	He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his
 26718	laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. NatÃ¡sha
 26719	would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation
 26720	awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere
 26721	thought of it made him turn pale and cold.
 26722	
 26723	On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with
 26724	him Pierre, who had not been to the RostÃ³vsâ once since the ball.
 26725	Pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the
 26726	countess, and NatÃ¡sha sat down beside a little chess table with SÃ³nya,
 26727	thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.
 26728	
 26729	âYou have known BezÃºkhov a long time?â he asked. âDo you like
 26730	him?â
 26731	
 26732	âYes, heâs a dear, but very absurd.â
 26733	
 26734	And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his
 26735	absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.
 26736	
 26737	âDo you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him
 26738	from childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,â Prince
 26739	Andrew said with sudden seriousnessââI am going away and heaven
 26740	knows what may happen. You may cease to... all right, I know I am not
 26741	to say that. Only this, then: whatever may happen to you when I am not
 26742	here...â
 26743	
 26744	âWhat can happen?â
 26745	
 26746	âWhatever trouble may come,â Prince Andrew continued, âI beg
 26747	you, Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for
 26748	advice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he
 26749	has a heart of gold.â
 26750	
 26751	Neither her father, nor her mother, nor SÃ³nya, nor Prince Andrew
 26752	himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act
 26753	on NatÃ¡sha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day,
 26754	dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding
 26755	what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed
 26756	her hand for the last time. âDonât go!â she said in a tone
 26757	that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he
 26758	remembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but
 26759	for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in
 26760	anything and only saying now and then, âOh, why did he go away?â
 26761	
 26762	But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around
 26763	her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became
 26764	her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a
 26765	child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face.
 26766	
 26767	
 26768	
 26769	
 26770	
 26771	CHAPTER XXV
 26772	
 26773	During that year after his sonâs departure, Prince Nicholas
 26774	BolkÃ³nskiâs health and temper became much worse. He grew still more
 26775	irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his
 26776	frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out
 26777	her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible.
 26778	Princess Mary had two passions and consequently two joysâher nephew,
 26779	little Nicholas, and religionâand these were the favorite subjects
 26780	of the princeâs attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken of he would
 26781	bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting
 26782	and spoiling of children. âYou want to make himââlittle
 26783	Nicholasââinto an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew
 26784	wants a son and not an old maid,â he would say. Or, turning to
 26785	Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Maryâs presence
 26786	how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.
 26787	
 26788	He continually hurt Princess Maryâs feelings and tormented her, but it
 26789	cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, or
 26790	could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust?
 26791	And what is justice? The princess never thought of that proud word
 26792	âjustice.â All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear
 26793	and simple lawâthe law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who
 26794	lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God. What had she to
 26795	do with the justice or injustice of other people? She had to endure and
 26796	love, and that she did.
 26797	
 26798	During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay,
 26799	gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a
 26800	long time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said
 26801	nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with
 26802	his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his
 26803	departure they were dissatisfied with one another.
 26804	
 26805	Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend
 26806	Julie KarÃ¡gina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream)
 26807	of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her
 26808	own brother, killed in Turkey.
 26809	
 26810	Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.
 26811	
 26812	Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a
 26813	special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your
 26814	excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, canâI
 26815	will not say comfort usâbut save us from despair. Religion alone can
 26816	explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what
 26817	cause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in lifeânot merely
 26818	harming no one but necessary to the happiness of othersâare called
 26819	away to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a
 26820	burden to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I
 26821	saw, and one I shall never forgetâthat of my dear sister-in-lawâleft
 26822	that impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother
 26823	had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged
 26824	anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to
 26825	die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since
 26826	then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly
 26827	why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression
 26828	of the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though
 26829	generally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite
 26830	love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically
 26831	innocent to have the strength to perform all a motherâs duties. As a
 26832	young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so
 26833	as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince
 26834	Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will
 26835	there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of
 26836	her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
 26837	influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at
 26838	the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should
 26839	then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and
 26840	certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you
 26841	of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not
 26842	a single hair of our heads will fall without His will. And His will is
 26843	governed only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for
 26844	our good.
 26845	
 26846	You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my
 26847	wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will
 26848	be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte! The case is
 26849	this: my fatherâs health is growing noticeably worse, he cannot stand
 26850	any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability is, as
 26851	you know, chiefly directed to political questions. He cannot endure
 26852	the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the
 26853	sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own, the grandson of the
 26854	Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite indifferent to politics, but
 26855	from my fatherâs remarks and his talks with Michael IvÃ¡novich I know
 26856	all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred
 26857	on Buonaparte, who only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is
 26858	not accepted as a great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my
 26859	father cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of
 26860	his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to
 26861	Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way
 26862	of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might
 26863	derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the
 26864	disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will
 26865	be decided very shortly.
 26866	
 26867	Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrewâs
 26868	absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late. After
 26869	his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits. He has again
 26870	become as I used to know him when a child: kind, affectionate, with that
 26871	heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me,
 26872	that life is not over for him. But together with this mental change
 26873	he has grown physically much weaker. He has become thinner and more
 26874	nervous. I am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad
 26875	which the doctors recommended long ago. I hope it will cure him. You
 26876	write that in Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active,
 26877	cultivated, and capable of the young men. Forgive my vanity as a
 26878	relation, but I never doubted it. The good he has done to everybody
 26879	here, from his peasants up to the gentry, is incalculable. On his
 26880	arrival in Petersburg he received only his due. I always wonder at the
 26881	way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow, especially such false ones as
 26882	that you write aboutâI mean the report of my brotherâs betrothal to
 26883	the little RostÃ³va. I do not think my brother will ever marry again,
 26884	and certainly not her; and this is why: first, I know that though he
 26885	rarely speaks about the wife he has lost, the grief of that loss
 26886	has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a
 26887	successor and our little angel a stepmother. Secondly because, as far
 26888	as I know, that girl is not the kind of girl who could please Prince
 26889	Andrew. I do not think he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do
 26890	not wish it. But I am running on too long and am at the end of my second
 26891	sheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty
 26892	care. My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.

 26900	CHAPTER XXVI
 26901	
 26902	In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter
 26903	from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and
 26904	surprising news. He informed her of his engagement to NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va.
 26905	The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender
 26906	and confiding affection for his sister. He wrote that he had never loved
 26907	as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
 26908	was. He asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his
 26909	resolve when he had last visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it
 26910	to his father. He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her
 26911	father to give his consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt
 26912	of his displeasure without attaining her object. âBesides,â he
 26913	wrote, âthe matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now.
 26914	My father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months,
 26915	half of that period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever.
 26916	If the doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in
 26917	Russia, but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You
 26918	know me and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have
 26919	been and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and
 26920	arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short
 26921	time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him about
 26922	the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the
 26923	letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether
 26924	there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months.â
 26925	
 26926	After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the
 26927	letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:
 26928	
 26929	âWrite and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It wonât be
 26930	longâI shall soon set him free.â
 26931	
 26932	The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak
 26933	and, raising his voice more and more, cried:
 26934	
 26935	âMarry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich,
 26936	eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell him
 26937	that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholasâ
 26938	stepmother and Iâll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustnât be
 26939	without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted
 26940	in my houseâlet him marry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go
 26941	and live with him too?â he added, turning to Princess Mary. âGo in
 26942	heavenâs name! Go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!â
 26943	
 26944	After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.
 26945	But repressed vexation at his sonâs poor-spirited behavior found
 26946	expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former pretexts
 26947	for irony a fresh one was now addedâallusions to stepmothers and
 26948	amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 26949	
 26950	âWhy shouldnât I marry her?â he asked his daughter. âSheâll
 26951	make a splendid princess!â
 26952	
 26953	And latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary
 26954	noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the
 26955	Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his
 26956	letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
 26957	idea.
 26958	
 26959	Little Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion
 26960	were Princess Maryâs joys and consolations; but besides that, since
 26961	everyone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest
 26962	depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief
 26963	consolation of her life. This comforting dream and hope were given her
 26964	by Godâs folkâthe half-witted and other pilgrims who visited
 26965	her without the princeâs knowledge. The longer she lived, the more
 26966	experience and observation she had of life, the greater was her wonder
 26967	at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here
 26968	on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming one another, to
 26969	obtain that impossible, visionary, sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had
 26970	loved his wife, she died, but that was not enough: he wanted to bind
 26971	his happiness to another woman. Her father objected to this because he
 26972	wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew. And they
 26973	all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their
 26974	souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment of benefits which endure
 26975	but for an instant. Not only do we know this ourselves, but Christ, the
 26976	Son of God, came down to earth and told us that this life is but for
 26977	a moment and is a probation; yet we cling to it and think to find
 26978	happiness in it. âHow is it that no one realizes this?â thought
 26979	Princess Mary. âNo one except these despised Godâs folk who, wallet
 26980	on back, come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen by the
 26981	prince, not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him
 26982	to sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, in
 26983	order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place
 26984	to place under an assumed name, doing no one any harm but praying for
 26985	allâfor those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one:
 26986	higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth!â
 26987	
 26988	There was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called
 26989	Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn
 26990	heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in
 26991	a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of
 26992	her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of
 26993	life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to
 26994	become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary
 26995	thought about this for a long time, and at last made up her mind that,
 26996	strange as it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed
 26997	this thought to no one but to her confessor, Father AkÃ­nfi, the monk,
 26998	and he approved of her intention. Under guise of a present for the
 26999	pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrimâs complete costume for
 27000	herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief.
 27001	Often, approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure,
 27002	Princess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time had not already come to
 27003	put her project into execution.
 27004	
 27005	Often, listening to the pilgrimsâ tales, she was so stimulated by
 27006	their simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep
 27007	meaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning
 27008	everything and running away from home. In imagination she already
 27009	pictured herself by Theodosiaâs side, dressed in coarse rags, walking
 27010	with a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road, directing her
 27011	wanderings from one saintâs shrine to another, free from envy, earthly
 27012	love, or desire, and reaching at last the place where there is no more
 27013	sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.
 27014	
 27015	âI shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get
 27016	used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till
 27017	my legs fail, and Iâll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at last
 27018	reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow nor
 27019	sighing...â thought Princess Mary.
 27020	
 27021	But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko
 27022	(Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she
 27023	was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.

 27032	
 27033	
 27034	
 27035	CHAPTER I
 27036	
 27037	The Bible legend tells us that the absence of laborâidlenessâwas a
 27038	condition of the first manâs blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man
 27039	has retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not
 27040	only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but
 27041	because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at
 27042	ease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If man
 27043	could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling
 27044	his duty, he would have found one of the conditions of manâs primitive
 27045	blessedness. And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness
 27046	is the lot of a whole classâthe military. The chief attraction of
 27047	military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and
 27048	irreproachable idleness.
 27049	
 27050	Nicholas RostÃ³v experienced this blissful condition to the full when,
 27051	after 1807, he continued to serve in the PÃ¡vlograd regiment, in which
 27052	he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from DenÃ­sov.
 27053	
 27054	RostÃ³v had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow
 27055	acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked
 27056	and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well
 27057	contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home
 27058	more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling
 27059	into greater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come
 27060	back to gladden and comfort his old parents.
 27061	
 27062	Reading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to
 27063	take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the
 27064	entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that
 27065	sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with
 27066	its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts
 27067	with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with
 27068	SÃ³nyaâs love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully difficult
 27069	and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters
 27070	in French, beginning: âMy dear Mamma,â and ending: âYour obedient
 27071	son,â which said nothing of when he would return. In 1810 he received
 27072	letters from his parents, in which they told him of NatÃ¡shaâs
 27073	engagement to BolkÃ³nski, and that the wedding would be in a yearâs
 27074	time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and
 27075	mortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that NatÃ¡sha, for
 27076	whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family, should be lost to
 27077	the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not
 27078	to have been there to show that fellow BolkÃ³nski that connection with
 27079	him was no such great honor after all, and that if he loved NatÃ¡sha he
 27080	might dispense with permission from his dotard father. For a moment he
 27081	hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see NatÃ¡sha
 27082	before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations
 27083	about SÃ³nya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas
 27084	again put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a letter
 27085	from his mother, written without his fatherâs knowledge, and that
 27086	letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and
 27087	take matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and
 27088	they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted
 27089	MÃ­tenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage
 27090	of him and things were going from bad to worse. âFor Godâs sake, I
 27091	implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole
 27092	family wretched,â wrote the countess.
 27093	
 27094	This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a
 27095	matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.
 27096	
 27097	The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate
 27098	to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his
 27099	after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious
 27100	gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when
 27101	he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed LavrÃºshka
 27102	(DenÃ­sovâs servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who
 27103	turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going
 27104	home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would
 27105	go away without having heard from the staffâand this interested him
 27106	extremelyâwhether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the
 27107	Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think
 27108	that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish
 27109	Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses RostÃ³v had betted
 27110	he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it
 27111	seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish
 27112	Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given
 27113	one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place
 27114	without himâhe knew he must go away from this good, bright world to
 27115	somewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week later he
 27116	obtained his leave. His hussar comradesânot only those of his own
 27117	regiment, but the whole brigadeâgave RostÃ³v a dinner to which the
 27118	subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were two
 27119	bands and two choirs of singers. RostÃ³v danced the TrepÃ¡k with Major
 27120	BÃ¡sov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped RostÃ³v; the
 27121	soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted âhurrah!â
 27122	and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first
 27123	post station.
 27124	
 27125	During the first half of the journeyâfrom KremenchÃºg to Kievâall
 27126	RostÃ³vâs thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with
 27127	the squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget
 27128	his three roans and DozhoyvÃ©yko, his quartermaster, and to wonder
 27129	anxiously how things would be at OtrÃ¡dnoe and what he would find
 27130	there. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached itâfar
 27131	stronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which
 27132	the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the
 27133	distance. At the last post station before OtrÃ¡dnoe he gave the driver a
 27134	three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the
 27135	steps of his home.
 27136	
 27137	After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied
 27138	expectationâthe feeling that âeverything is just the same, so why
 27139	did I hurry?ââNicholas began to settle down in his old home world.
 27140	His father and mother were much the same, only a little older. What was
 27141	new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there
 27142	used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the
 27143	bad state of their affairs. SÃ³nya was nearly twenty; she had stopped
 27144	growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already, but
 27145	that was enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas
 27146	returned, and the faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a
 27147	gladdening effect on him. PÃ©tya and NatÃ¡sha surprised Nicholas
 27148	most. PÃ©tya was a big handsome boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and
 27149	mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking. As for NatÃ¡sha,
 27150	for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at
 27151	her.
 27152	
 27153	âYouâre not the same at all,â he said.
 27154	
 27155	âHow? Am I uglier?â
 27156	
 27157	âOn the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!â he whispered to
 27158	her.
 27159	
 27160	âYes, yes, yes!â cried NatÃ¡sha, joyfully.
 27161	
 27162	She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to
 27163	OtrÃ¡dnoe and showed him his last letter.
 27164	
 27165	âWell, are you glad?â NatÃ¡sha asked. âI am so tranquil and happy
 27166	now.â
 27167	
 27168	âVery glad,â answered Nicholas. âHe is an excellent fellow.... And
 27169	are you very much in love?â
 27170	
 27171	âHow shall I put it?â replied NatÃ¡sha. âI was in love with
 27172	BorÃ­s, with my teacher, and with DenÃ­sov, but this is quite different.
 27173	I feel at peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists,
 27174	and I am calm and contented now. Not at all as before.â
 27175	
 27176	Nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage
 27177	for a year; but NatÃ¡sha attacked her brother with exasperation, proving
 27178	to him that it could not be otherwise, and that it would be a bad thing
 27179	to enter a family against the fatherâs will, and that she herself
 27180	wished it so.
 27181	
 27182	âYou donât at all understand,â she said.
 27183	
 27184	Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.
 27185	
 27186	Her brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem at
 27187	all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband. She was
 27188	even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed
 27189	Nicholas and even made him regard BolkÃ³nskiâs courtship skeptically.
 27190	He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially as he had
 27191	not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him that there was
 27192	something not quite right about this intended marriage.
 27193	
 27194	âWhy this delay? Why no betrothal?â he thought. Once, when he had
 27195	touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise
 27196	and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too
 27197	had doubts about this marriage.
 27198	
 27199	âYou see he writes,â said she, showing her son a letter of Prince
 27200	Andrewâs, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a
 27201	daughterâs future married happiness, âhe writes that he wonât come
 27202	before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health
 27203	is very delicate. Donât tell NatÃ¡sha. And donât attach importance
 27204	to her being so bright: thatâs because sheâs living through the last
 27205	days of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every time we receive
 27206	a letter from him! However, God grant that everything turns out well!â
 27207	(She always ended with these words.) âHe is an excellent man!â
 27208	
 27209	
 27210	
 27211	
 27212	
 27213	CHAPTER II
 27214	
 27215	After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull. He was
 27216	worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business
 27217	matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw off this
 27218	burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his arrival he
 27219	went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he
 27220	was going, to MÃ­tenkaâs lodge and demanded an account of everything.
 27221	But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less
 27222	than the frightened and bewildered MÃ­tenka. The conversation and the
 27223	examination of the accounts with MÃ­tenka did not last long. The village
 27224	elder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in
 27225	the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young countâs voice
 27226	roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and then words of
 27227	abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.
 27228	
 27229	âRobber!... Ungrateful wretch!... Iâll hack the dog to pieces! Iâm
 27230	not my father!... Robbing us!...â and so on.
 27231	
 27232	Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in
 27233	the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged MÃ­tenka out by the scruff of
 27234	the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility
 27235	at convenient moments between the words, shouting, âBe off! Never let
 27236	me see your face here again, you villain!â
 27237	
 27238	MÃ­tenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
 27239	shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits
 27240	at OtrÃ¡dnoe. MÃ­tenka himself, returning tipsy from the town, used
 27241	to hide there, and many of the residents at OtrÃ¡dnoe, hiding from
 27242	MÃ­tenka, knew of its protective qualities.)
 27243	
 27244	MÃ­tenkaâs wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened
 27245	faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and
 27246	where the stewardâs high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt.
 27247	
 27248	The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by
 27249	with resolute strides and went into the house.
 27250	
 27251	The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the
 27252	lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly
 27253	improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this
 27254	excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his door on
 27255	tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.
 27256	
 27257	Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed
 27258	smile, said to him:
 27259	
 27260	âBut you know, my dear boy, itâs a pity you got excited! MÃ­tenka
 27261	has told me all about it.â
 27262	
 27263	âI knew,â thought Nicholas, âthat I should never understand
 27264	anything in this crazy world.â
 27265	
 27266	âYou were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they
 27267	were carried forwardâand you did not look at the other page.â
 27268	
 27269	âPapa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have
 27270	done, I have done; but, if you like, I wonât speak to him again.â
 27271	
 27272	âNo, my dear boyâ (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he had
 27273	mismanaged his wifeâs property and was to blame toward his children,
 27274	but he did not know how to remedy it). âNo, I beg you to attend to the
 27275	business. I am old. I...â
 27276	
 27277	âNo, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I
 27278	understand it all less than you do.â
 27279	
 27280	âDevil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings
 27281	forward from page to page,â he thought. âI used to understand what
 27282	a âcornerâ and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to
 27283	another page I donât understand at all,â said he to himself, and
 27284	after that he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess
 27285	called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from Anna
 27286	MikhÃ¡ylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he thought of
 27287	doing with it.
 27288	
 27289	âThis,â answered Nicholas. âYou say it rests with me. Well, I
 27290	donât like Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna and I donât like BorÃ­s, but they were
 27291	our friends and poor. Well then, this!â and he tore up the note, and
 27292	by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After that,
 27293	young RostÃ³v took no further part in any business affairs, but
 27294	devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new
 27295	pursuitâthe chaseâfor which his father kept a large establishment.
 27296	
 27297	
 27298	
 27299	
 27300	
 27301	CHAPTER III
 27302	
 27303	The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed
 27304	an earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had thickened and its
 27305	bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye
 27306	trodden down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the
 27307	spring buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of
 27308	August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had
 27309	become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The
 27310	hares had already half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were
 27311	beginning to scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was
 27312	the best time of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young
 27313	sportsman RostÃ³v had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were
 27314	so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them
 27315	a three daysâ rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on
 27316	a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an
 27317	undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.
 27318	
 27319	All that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was
 27320	sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw.
 27321	On the fifteenth, when young RostÃ³v, in his dressing gown, looked out
 27322	of the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it
 27323	was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any
 27324	wind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic
 27325	particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with
 27326	transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in
 27327	the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed
 27328	and at a short distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist.
 27329	Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of
 27330	decaying leaves and of dog. MÃ­lka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched
 27331	bitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched
 27332	her hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and
 27333	licked him right on his nose and mustache. Another borzoi, a dog,
 27334	catching sight of his master from the garden path, arched his back
 27335	and, rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail, began rubbing
 27336	himself against his legs.
 27337	
 27338	âO-hoy!â came at that moment, that inimitable huntsmanâs call
 27339	which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round
 27340	the corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray,
 27341	wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian
 27342	fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence
 27343	and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his
 27344	Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This scorn
 27345	was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel,
 27346	disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all
 27347	the same his serf and huntsman.
 27348	
 27349	âDaniel!â Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the
 27350	weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away
 27351	by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all
 27352	his previous resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his
 27353	mistress.
 27354	
 27355	âWhat orders, your excellency?â said the huntsman in his deep bass,
 27356	deep as a proto-deaconâs and hoarse with hallooingâand two flashing
 27357	black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent.
 27358	âCan you resist it?â those eyes seemed to be asking.
 27359	
 27360	âItâs a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?â asked
 27361	Nicholas, scratching MÃ­lka behind the ears.
 27362	
 27363	Daniel did not answer, but winked instead.
 27364	
 27365	âI sent UvÃ¡rka at dawn to listen,â his bass boomed out after a
 27366	minuteâs pause. âHe says sheâs moved them into the OtrÃ¡dnoe
 27367	enclosure. They were howling there.â (This meant that the she-wolf,
 27368	about whom they both knew, had moved with her cubs to the OtrÃ¡dnoe
 27369	copse, a small place a mile and a half from the house.)
 27370	
 27371	âWe ought to go, donât you think so?â said Nicholas. âCome to me
 27372	with UvÃ¡rka.â
 27373	
 27374	âAs you please.â
 27375	
 27376	âThen put off feeding them.â
 27377	
 27378	âYes, sir.â
 27379	
 27380	Five minutes later Daniel and UvÃ¡rka were standing in Nicholasâ big
 27381	study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was
 27382	like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
 27383	surroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual stood
 27384	just inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for fear of
 27385	breaking something in the masterâs apartment, and he hastened to say
 27386	all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling, out into
 27387	the open under the sky once more.
 27388	
 27389	Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that
 27390	the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nicholas
 27391	ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was about to
 27392	go NatÃ¡sha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or
 27393	finished dressing and with her old nurseâs big shawl wrapped round
 27394	her. PÃ©tya ran in at the same time.
 27395	
 27396	âYou are going?â asked NatÃ¡sha. âI knew you would! SÃ³nya said
 27397	you wouldnât go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you
 27398	couldnât help going.â
 27399	
 27400	âYes, we are going,â replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he
 27401	intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya.
 27402	âWe are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for you.â
 27403	
 27404	âYou know it is my greatest pleasure,â said NatÃ¡sha. âItâs not
 27405	fair; you are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said
 27406	nothing to us about it.â
 27407	
 27408	ââNo barrier bars a Russianâs pathââweâll go!â shouted
 27409	PÃ©tya.
 27410	
 27411	âBut you canât. Mamma said you mustnât,â said Nicholas to
 27412	NatÃ¡sha.
 27413	
 27414	âYes, Iâll go. I shall certainly go,â said NatÃ¡sha decisively.
 27415	âDaniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my
 27416	dogs,â she added to the huntsman.
 27417	
 27418	It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but to
 27419	have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible. He
 27420	cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business,
 27421	careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young
 27422	lady.
 27423	
 27424	
 27425	
 27426	
 27427	
 27428	CHAPTER IV
 27429	
 27430	The old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment
 27431	but had now handed it all completely over to his sonâs care, being
 27432	in very good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out
 27433	with the others.
 27434	
 27435	In an hourâs time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas,
 27436	with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
 27437	attending to trifles, went past NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya who were trying to
 27438	tell him something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent
 27439	a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his
 27440	chestnut DonÃ©ts, and whistling to his own leash of borzois, set off
 27441	across the threshing ground to a field leading to the OtrÃ¡dnoe wood.
 27442	The old countâs horse, a sorrel gelding called ViflyÃ¡nka, was led by
 27443	the groom in attendance on him, while the count himself was to drive in
 27444	a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him.
 27445	
 27446	They were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and
 27447	whippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen
 27448	and more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash
 27449	belonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and
 27450	thirty dogs and twenty horsemen.
 27451	
 27452	Each dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his
 27453	business, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the
 27454	fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,
 27455	along the road and field leading to the OtrÃ¡dnoe covert.
 27456	
 27457	The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and then
 27458	splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky still
 27459	seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the air
 27460	was still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman,
 27461	the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling
 27462	hound could be heard.
 27463	
 27464	When they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders with
 27465	dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the RostÃ³vs. In front rode a
 27466	fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.
 27467	
 27468	âGood morning, Uncle!â said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.
 27469	
 27470	âThatâs it. Come on!... I was sure of it,â began âUncle.â (He
 27471	was a distant relative of the RostÃ³vsâ, a man of small means, and
 27472	their neighbor.) âI knew you wouldnât be able to resist it and
 27473	itâs a good thing youâre going. Thatâs it! Come on!â (This was
 27474	âUncleâsâ favorite expression.) âTake the covert at once, for my
 27475	GÃ­rchik says the IlÃ¡gins are at KornikÃ­ with their hounds. Thatâs
 27476	it. Come on!... Theyâll take the cubs from under your very nose.â
 27477	
 27478	âThatâs where Iâm going. Shall we join up our packs?â asked
 27479	Nicholas.
 27480	
 27481	The hounds were joined into one pack, and âUncleâ and Nicholas rode
 27482	on side by side. NatÃ¡sha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her
 27483	eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed by
 27484	PÃ©tya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a
 27485	groom appointed to look after her. PÃ©tya, who was laughing, whipped and
 27486	pulled at his horse. NatÃ¡sha sat easily and confidently on her black
 27487	ArÃ¡bchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.
 27488	
 27489	âUncleâ looked round disapprovingly at PÃ©tya and NatÃ¡sha. He did
 27490	not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.
 27491	
 27492	âGood morning, Uncle! We are going too!â shouted PÃ©tya.
 27493	
 27494	âGood morning, good morning! But donât go overriding the hounds,â
 27495	said âUncleâ sternly.
 27496	
 27497	âNicholas, what a fine dog TrunÃ­la is! He knew me,â said NatÃ¡sha,
 27498	referring to her favorite hound.
 27499	
 27500	âIn the first place, TrunÃ­la is not a âdog,â but a harrier,â
 27501	thought Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her
 27502	feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment. NatÃ¡sha
 27503	understood it.
 27504	
 27505	âYou mustnât think weâll be in anyoneâs way, Uncle,â she said.
 27506	âWeâll go to our places and wonât budge.â
 27507	
 27508	âA good thing too, little countess,â said âUncle,â âonly mind
 27509	you donât fall off your horse,â he added, âbecauseâthatâs it,
 27510	come on!âyouâve nothing to hold on to.â
 27511	
 27512	The oasis of the OtrÃ¡dnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off,
 27513	the huntsmen were already nearing it. RostÃ³v, having finally settled
 27514	with âUncleâ where they should set on the hounds, and having shown
 27515	NatÃ¡sha where she was to standâa spot where nothing could possibly
 27516	run outâwent round above the ravine.
 27517	
 27518	âWell, nephew, youâre going for a big wolf,â said âUncle.â
 27519	âMind and donât let her slip!â
 27520	
 27521	âThatâs as may happen,â answered RostÃ³v. âKarÃ¡y, here!â he
 27522	shouted, answering âUncleâsâ remark by this call to his borzoi.
 27523	KarÃ¡y was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having
 27524	tackled a big wolf unaided. They all took up their places.
 27525	
 27526	The old count, knowing his sonâs ardor in the hunt, hurried so as not
 27527	to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count
 27528	IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove up
 27529	with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him,
 27530	where a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and fastened
 27531	on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed,
 27532	and comfortable horse, ViflyÃ¡nka, which was turning gray, like himself.
 27533	His horses and trap were sent home. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, though not at
 27534	heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well, and rode to
 27535	the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged his reins,
 27536	settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked
 27537	about with a smile.
 27538	
 27539	Beside him was Simon ChekmÃ¡r, his personal attendant, an old horseman
 27540	now somewhat stiff in the saddle. ChekmÃ¡r held in leash three
 27541	formidable wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master
 27542	and his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred paces
 27543	farther along the edge of the wood stood MÃ­tka, the countâs other
 27544	groom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the hunt, by
 27545	old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken
 27546	a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.
 27547	
 27548	He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were
 27549	rather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his saddle,
 27550	wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out for an
 27551	outing.
 27552	
 27553	The thin, hollow-cheeked ChekmÃ¡r, having got everything ready, kept
 27554	glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for
 27555	thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant
 27556	chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood (it was
 27557	plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count. This
 27558	person was a gray-bearded old man in a womanâs cloak, with a tall
 27559	peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who went by a womanâs
 27560	name, NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna.
 27561	
 27562	âWell, NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna!â whispered the count, winking at him.
 27563	âIf you scare away the beast, Danielâll give it you!â
 27564	
 27565	âI know a thing or two myself!â said NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna.
 27566	
 27567	âHush!â whispered the count and turned to Simon. âHave you seen
 27568	the young countess?â he asked. âWhere is she?â
 27569	
 27570	âWith young Count Peter, by the ZhÃ¡rov rank grass,â answered Simon,
 27571	smiling. âThough sheâs a lady, sheâs very fond of hunting.â
 27572	
 27573	âAnd youâre surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?â said the
 27574	count. âSheâs as good as many a man!â
 27575	
 27576	âOf course! Itâs marvelous. So bold, so easy!â
 27577	
 27578	âAnd Nicholas? Where is he? By the LyÃ¡dov upland, isnât he?â
 27579	
 27580	âYes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so well
 27581	that Daniel and I are often quite astounded,â said Simon, well knowing
 27582	what would please his master.
 27583	
 27584	âRides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?â
 27585	
 27586	âA perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
 27587	ZavÃ¡rzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight
 27588	when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles
 27589	and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search far to
 27590	find another as smart.â
 27591	
 27592	âTo search far...â repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not
 27593	said more. âTo search far,â he said, turning back the skirt of his
 27594	coat to get at his snuffbox.
 27595	
 27596	âThe other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael
 27597	SidÃ³rych...â Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had
 27598	distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds
 27599	giving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a warning
 27600	finger at his master. âThey are on the scent of the cubs...â he
 27601	whispered, âstraight to the LyÃ¡dov uplands.â
 27602	
 27603	The count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked into
 27604	the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space, holding
 27605	the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry of the hounds
 27606	came the deep tones of the wolf call from Danielâs hunting horn; the
 27607	pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry,
 27608	with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after
 27609	a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the
 27610	cry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Danielâs voice, now a deep
 27611	bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and
 27612	carried far beyond out into the open field.
 27613	
 27614	After listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant
 27615	convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the
 27616	sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in
 27617	the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and
 27618	it was with this that Danielâs voice was heard calling ulyulyu.
 27619	The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were
 27620	becoming more distant.
 27621	
 27622	Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had
 27623	entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand,
 27624	opened it and took a pinch. âBack!â cried Simon to a borzoi that
 27625	was pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and dropped the
 27626	snuffbox. NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna dismounted to pick it up. The count and
 27627	Simon were looking at him.
 27628	
 27629	Then, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly
 27630	approached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just
 27631	in front of them.
 27632	
 27633	The count turned and saw on his right MÃ­tka staring at him with eyes
 27634	starting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to the
 27635	other side.
 27636	
 27637	âLook out!â he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had long
 27638	fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he galloped
 27639	toward the count.
 27640	
 27641	The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
 27642	wolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet
 27643	lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.
 27644	The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
 27645	horsesâ feet at the wolf.
 27646	
 27647	The wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly,
 27648	like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying
 27649	from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail
 27650	disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry
 27651	like a wail, first one hound, then another, and then another, sprang
 27652	helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across
 27653	the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel
 27654	bushes parted behind the hounds and Danielâs chestnut horse appeared,
 27655	dark with sweat. On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless,
 27656	his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.
 27657	
 27658	âUlyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...â he cried. When he caught sight of the
 27659	count his eyes flashed lightning.
 27660	
 27661	âBlast you!â he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the
 27662	count.
 27663	
 27664	âYouâve let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!â and as if scorning to
 27665	say more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving
 27666	flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count
 27667	had aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a punished
 27668	schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simonâs sympathy for
 27669	his plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was galloping round by the
 27670	bushes while the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head
 27671	the wolf, but it vanished into the wood before they could do so.
 27672	
 27673	
 27674	
 27675	
 27676	
 27677	CHAPTER V
 27678	
 27679	Nicholas RostÃ³v meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the wolf.
 27680	By the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of the dogs
 27681	whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen
 27682	approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was happening at the
 27683	copse. He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had
 27684	separated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and
 27685	that something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any
 27686	moment. He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and
 27687	from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope
 27688	alternated with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God
 27689	that the wolf should come his way. He prayed with that passionate and
 27690	shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement
 27691	arising from trivial causes. âWhat would it be to Thee to do this for
 27692	me?â he said to God. âI know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to
 27693	ask this of Thee, but for Godâs sake do let the old wolf come my way
 27694	and let KarÃ¡y spring at itâin sight of âUncleâ who is watching
 27695	from over thereâand seize it by the throat in a death grip!â A
 27696	thousand times during that half-hour RostÃ³v cast eager and restless
 27697	glances over the edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising
 27698	above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and
 27699	âUncleâsâ cap just visible above the bush on his right.
 27700	
 27701	âNo, I shanât have such luck,â thought RostÃ³v, âyet what
 27702	wouldnât it be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in
 27703	war, I am always unlucky.â Memories of Austerlitz and of DÃ³lokhov
 27704	flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind. âOnly once in my life
 27705	to get an old wolf, I want only that!â thought he, straining eyes and
 27706	ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the
 27707	slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs.
 27708	
 27709	Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across
 27710	the deserted field. âNo, it canât be!â thought RostÃ³v, taking a
 27711	deep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for.
 27712	The height of happiness was reachedâand so simply, without warning, or
 27713	noise, or display, that RostÃ³v could not believe his eyes and remained
 27714	in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over
 27715	a gully that lay in her path. She was an old animal with a gray back and
 27716	big reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no
 27717	one saw her. RostÃ³v, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois.
 27718	They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation.
 27719	Old KarÃ¡y had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas,
 27720	baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.
 27721	
 27722	âUlyulyulyu!â whispered RostÃ³v, pouting his lips. The borzois
 27723	jumped up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears.
 27724	KarÃ¡y finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got
 27725	up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.
 27726	
 27727	âShall I loose them or not?â Nicholas asked himself as the wolf
 27728	approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolfâs whole
 27729	physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never
 27730	seen beforeâhuman eyes fixed upon herâand turning her head a little
 27731	toward RostÃ³v, she paused.
 27732	
 27733	âBack or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...â the wolf seemed to say
 27734	to herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a
 27735	quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.
 27736	
 27737	âUlyulyu!â cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own
 27738	accord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies
 27739	to head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still.
 27740	Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor
 27741	see the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the
 27742	wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same direction along
 27743	the hollow. The first to come into view was MÃ­lka, with her black
 27744	markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and
 27745	nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face
 27746	her, and instead of putting on speed as she usually did MÃ­lka suddenly
 27747	raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.
 27748	
 27749	âUlyulyulyulyu!â shouted Nicholas.
 27750	
 27751	The reddish LyubÃ­m rushed forward from behind MÃ­lka, sprang
 27752	impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but
 27753	immediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her
 27754	teeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of a
 27755	couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to her.
 27756	
 27757	âSheâll get away! No, itâs impossible!â thought Nicholas, still
 27758	shouting with a hoarse voice.
 27759	
 27760	âKarÃ¡y, ulyulyu!...â he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi
 27761	who was now his only hope. KarÃ¡y, with all the strength age had left
 27762	him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped
 27763	heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolfâs
 27764	lope and the borzoiâs slower pace made it plain that KarÃ¡y had
 27765	miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the
 27766	wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it. But,
 27767	coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost
 27768	straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish
 27769	young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed
 27770	impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But
 27771	the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and,
 27772	gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing
 27773	yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in its
 27774	side.
 27775	
 27776	âKarÃ¡y? Old fellow!...â wailed Nicholas.
 27777	
 27778	Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolfâs path, the
 27779	old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five
 27780	paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on
 27781	KarÃ¡y, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and increased
 27782	her speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to
 27783	KarÃ¡yâthe borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together
 27784	down into a gully just in front of them.
 27785	
 27786	That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully
 27787	with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and
 27788	outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears
 27789	laid back (KarÃ¡y was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest
 27790	moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to
 27791	dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from
 27792	among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the
 27793	gully. She clicked her teeth (KarÃ¡y no longer had her by the throat),
 27794	leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and having
 27795	disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went
 27796	forward. KarÃ¡y, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or wounded,
 27797	climbed with difficulty out of the gully.
 27798	
 27799	âOh my God! Why?â Nicholas cried in despair.
 27800	
 27801	âUncleâsâ huntsman was galloping from the other side across the
 27802	wolfâs path and his borzois once more stopped the animalâs advance.
 27803	She was again hemmed in.
 27804	
 27805	Nicholas and his attendant, with âUncleâ and his huntsman, were all
 27806	riding round the wolf, crying âulyulyu!â shouting and preparing to
 27807	dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward
 27808	again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she
 27809	would be safe.
 27810	
 27811	Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing,
 27812	had rushed out from the wood. He saw KarÃ¡y seize the wolf, and checked
 27813	his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the
 27814	horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for
 27815	safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight
 27816	toward the wood, just as KarÃ¡y had run to cut the animal off. As
 27817	a result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been
 27818	stopped a second time by âUncleâsâ borzois.
 27819	
 27820	Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and
 27821	thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if
 27822	it were a flail.
 27823	
 27824	Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing
 27825	heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel
 27826	lying on the wolfâs back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the
 27827	ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself
 27828	that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and
 27829	tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took
 27830	a step, and with his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on
 27831	the wolf, seizing her by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but
 27832	Daniel whispered, âDonât! Weâll gag her!â and, changing his
 27833	position, set his foot on the wolfâs neck. A stick was thrust between
 27834	her jaws and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her legs were
 27835	bound together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to
 27836	side.
 27837	
 27838	With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying
 27839	and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her
 27840	to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of
 27841	the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with their booty
 27842	and their stories, and all came to look at the wolf, which, with her
 27843	broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws,
 27844	gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding
 27845	her. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly
 27846	yet simply at everybody. Old Count RostÃ³v also rode up and touched the
 27847	wolf.
 27848	
 27849	âOh, what a formidable one!â said he. âA formidable one, eh?â he
 27850	asked Daniel, who was standing near.
 27851	
 27852	âYes, your excellency,â answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.
 27853	
 27854	The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with
 27855	Daniel.
 27856	
 27857	âAh, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!â said the count.
 27858	
 27859	For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable
 27860	smile.
 27861	
 27862	
 27863	
 27864	
 27865	
 27866	CHAPTER VI
 27867	
 27868	The old count went home, and NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya promised to return very
 27869	soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday
 27870	they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees.
 27871	Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips.
 27872	
 27873	Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone
 27874	in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed
 27875	before Nicholas heard one he knew, VoltÃ³rn, giving tongue at intervals;
 27876	other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A
 27877	moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been
 27878	found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine
 27879	toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.
 27880	
 27881	He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
 27882	ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself
 27883	at any moment on the ryefield opposite.
 27884	
 27885	The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and
 27886	Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard
 27887	across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close
 27888	to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper
 27889	curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed
 27890	in followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois
 27891	formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with
 27892	tails turned away from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up
 27893	to the dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.
 27894	
 27895	âWhatâs this?â thought Nicholas. âWhereâs that huntsman from?
 27896	He is not âUncleâsâ man.â
 27897	
 27898	The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping
 27899	it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high saddles, stood
 27900	near them and there too the dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their
 27901	arms and did something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound of
 27902	a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of a fight.
 27903	
 27904	âThatâs IlÃ¡ginâs huntsman having a row with our IvÃ¡n,â said
 27905	Nicholasâ groom.
 27906	
 27907	Nicholas sent the man to call NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya to him, and rode at a
 27908	footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.
 27909	Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.
 27910	
 27911	Nicholas dismounted, and with NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya, who had ridden up,
 27912	stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would end. Out of
 27913	the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward
 27914	his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still at a
 27915	distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was
 27916	pale and breathless and his face was angry. One of his eyes was black,
 27917	but he probably was not even aware of it.
 27918	
 27919	âWhat has happened?â asked Nicholas.
 27920	
 27921	âA likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my gray
 27922	bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the fox! I
 27923	gave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste
 27924	of this?...â said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably
 27925	imagining himself still speaking to his foe.
 27926	
 27927	Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and PÃ©tya
 27928	to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemyâs, IlÃ¡ginâs,
 27929	hunting party was.
 27930	
 27931	The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,
 27932	surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.
 27933	
 27934	The facts were that IlÃ¡gin, with whom the RostÃ³vs had a quarrel and
 27935	were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the RostÃ³vs,
 27936	and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the
 27937	RostÃ³vs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had
 27938	chased.
 27939	
 27940	Nicholas, though he had never seen IlÃ¡gin, with his usual absence
 27941	of moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his
 27942	arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He
 27943	rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully
 27944	prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
 27945	enemy.
 27946	
 27947	Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in
 27948	a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,
 27949	accompanied by two hunt servants.
 27950	
 27951	Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in IlÃ¡gin a stately and courteous
 27952	gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young countâs
 27953	acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, IlÃ¡gin raised his beaver
 27954	cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the
 27955	man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone
 27956	elseâs borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted with the count
 27957	and invited him to draw his covert.
 27958	
 27959	NatÃ¡sha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had
 27960	followed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly
 27961	greetings, she rode up to them. IlÃ¡gin lifted his beaver cap still
 27962	higher to NatÃ¡sha and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young
 27963	countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her
 27964	beauty, of which he had heard much.
 27965	
 27966	To expiate his huntsmanâs offense, IlÃ¡gin pressed the RostÃ³vs to
 27967	come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for
 27968	himself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and the
 27969	hunt, now doubled, moved on.
 27970	
 27971	The way to Iliginâs upland was across the fields. The hunt servants
 27972	fell into line. The masters rode together. âUncle,â RostÃ³v, and
 27973	IlÃ¡gin kept stealthily glancing at one anotherâs dogs, trying not
 27974	to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to
 27975	their own borzois.
 27976	
 27977	RostÃ³v was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred,
 27978	red-spotted bitch on IlÃ¡ginâs leash, slender but with muscles like
 27979	steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of
 27980	the swiftness of IlÃ¡ginâs borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a
 27981	rival to his own MÃ­lka.
 27982	
 27983	In the middle of a sober conversation begun by IlÃ¡gin about the
 27984	yearâs harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.
 27985	
 27986	âA fine little bitch, that!â said he in a careless tone. âIs she
 27987	swift?â
 27988	
 27989	âThat one? Yes, sheâs a good dog, gets what sheâs after,â
 27990	answered IlÃ¡gin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch ErzÃ¡, for
 27991	which, a year before, he had given a neighbor three families of house
 27992	serfs. âSo in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of,
 27993	Count?â he went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And
 27994	considering it polite to return the young countâs compliment, IlÃ¡gin
 27995	looked at his borzois and picked out MÃ­lka who attracted his attention
 27996	by her breadth. âThat black-spotted one of yours is fineâwell
 27997	shaped!â said he.
 27998	
 27999	âYes, sheâs fast enough,â replied Nicholas, and thought: âIf
 28000	only a full-grown hare would cross the field now Iâd show you what
 28001	sort of borzoi she is,â and turning to his groom, he said he would
 28002	give a ruble to anyone who found a hare.
 28003	
 28004	âI donât understand,â continued IlÃ¡gin, âhow some sportsmen can
 28005	be so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count,
 28006	I enjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?â (he
 28007	again raised his cap to NatÃ¡sha) âbut as for counting skins and what
 28008	one takes, I donât care about that.â
 28009	
 28010	âOf course not!â
 28011	
 28012	âOr being upset because someone elseâs borzoi and not mine catches
 28013	something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so,
 28014	Count? For I consider that...â
 28015	
 28016	âA-tu!â came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in,
 28017	who had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip
 28018	aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, âA-tu!â (This call and
 28019	the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)
 28020	
 28021	âAh, he has found one, I think,â said IlÃ¡gin carelessly. âYes, we
 28022	must ride up.... Shall we both course it?â answered Nicholas, seeing
 28023	in ErzÃ¡ and âUncleâsâ red RugÃ¡y two rivals he had never yet had
 28024	a chance of pitting against his own borzois. âAnd suppose they outdo
 28025	my MÃ­lka at once!â he thought as he rode with âUncleâ and IlÃ¡gin
 28026	toward the hare.
 28027	
 28028	âA full-grown one?â asked IlÃ¡gin as he approached the whip who
 28029	had sighted the hareâand not without agitation he looked round and
 28030	whistled to ErzÃ¡.
 28031	
 28032	âAnd you, Michael NikanÃ³rovich?â he said, addressing âUncle.â
 28033	
 28034	The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.
 28035	
 28036	âHow can I join in? Why, youâve given a village for each of your
 28037	borzois! Thatâs it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours
 28038	against one another, you two, and Iâll look on!â
 28039	
 28040	âRugÃ¡y, hey, hey!â he shouted. âRugÃ¡yushka!â he added,
 28041	involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes
 28042	he placed on this red borzoi. NatÃ¡sha saw and felt the agitation the
 28043	two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself
 28044	excited by it.
 28045	
 28046	The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the
 28047	gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off
 28048	on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the
 28049	gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately.
 28050	
 28051	âHow is it pointing?â asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward
 28052	the whip who had sighted the hare.
 28053	
 28054	But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming
 28055	next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed
 28056	downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that
 28057	were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt,
 28058	who had been moving slowly, shouted, âStop!â calling in the hounds,
 28059	while the borzoi whips, with a cry of âA-tu!â galloped across the
 28060	field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil IlÃ¡gin, Nicholas,
 28061	NatÃ¡sha, and âUncleâ flew, reckless of where and how they went,
 28062	seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even
 28063	for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started was a strong and
 28064	swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at once, but pricked his
 28065	ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all
 28066	sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the
 28067	borzois gain on him, and, finally having chosen his direction and
 28068	realized his danger, laid back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had
 28069	been lying in the stubble, but in front of him was the autumn sowing
 28070	where the ground was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had
 28071	sighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue
 28072	him, but they had not gone far before IlÃ¡ginâs red-spotted ErzÃ¡
 28073	passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible
 28074	swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, rolled
 28075	over like a ball. The hare arched his back and bounded off yet more
 28076	swiftly. From behind ErzÃ¡ rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted
 28077	MÃ­lka and began rapidly gaining on the hare.
 28078	
 28079	âMilÃ¡shka, dear!â rose Nicholasâ triumphant cry. It looked as if
 28080	MÃ­lka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and
 28081	flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful ErzÃ¡ reached him,
 28082	but when close to the hareâs scut paused as if measuring the distance,
 28083	so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg.
 28084	
 28085	âErzÃ¡, darling!â IlÃ¡gin wailed in a voice unlike his own. ErzÃ¡
 28086	did not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have
 28087	seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the
 28088	winter rye and the stubble. Again ErzÃ¡ and MÃ­lka were abreast, running
 28089	like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but
 28090	it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not
 28091	overtake him so quickly.
 28092	
 28093	âRugÃ¡y, RugÃ¡yushka! Thatâs it, come on!â came a third voice just
 28094	then, and âUncleâsâ red borzoi, straining and curving its back,
 28095	caught up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless
 28096	of the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off
 28097	the balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously,
 28098	sinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was
 28099	how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois
 28100	surrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd
 28101	of dogs. Only the delighted âUncleâ dismounted, and cut off a pad,
 28102	shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing round
 28103	with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He spoke without
 28104	himself knowing whom to or what about. âThatâs it, come on! Thatâs
 28105	a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as
 28106	the one-ruble borzois. Thatâs it, come on!â said he, panting and
 28107	looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone, as if they
 28108	were all his enemies and had insulted him, and only now had he at
 28109	last succeeded in justifying himself. âThere are your thousand-ruble
 28110	ones.... Thatâs it, come on!...â
 28111	
 28112	âRugÃ¡y, hereâs a pad for you!â he said, throwing down the
 28113	hareâs muddy pad. âYouâve deserved it, thatâs it, come on!â
 28114	
 28115	âSheâd tired herself out, sheâd run it down three times by
 28116	herself,â said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless
 28117	of whether he were heard or not.
 28118	
 28119	âBut what is there in running across it like that?â said IlÃ¡ginâs
 28120	groom.
 28121	
 28122	âOnce she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take
 28123	it,â IlÃ¡gin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop
 28124	and his excitement. At the same moment NatÃ¡sha, without drawing
 28125	breath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set
 28126	everyoneâs ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the others
 28127	expressed by all talking at once, and it was so strange that she must
 28128	herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have
 28129	been amazed at it at any other time. âUncleâ himself twisted up the
 28130	hare, threw it neatly and smartly across his horseâs back as if by
 28131	that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with an air of not
 28132	wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode off. The others all
 28133	followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much later were they able
 28134	to regain their former affectation of indifference. For a long time they
 28135	continued to look at red RugÃ¡y who, his arched back spattered with
 28136	mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked along just behind
 28137	âUncleâsâ horse with the serene air of a conqueror.
 28138	
 28139	âWell, I am like any other dog as long as itâs not a question of
 28140	coursing. But when it is, then look out!â his appearance seemed to
 28141	Nicholas to be saying.
 28142	
 28143	When, much later, âUncleâ rode up to Nicholas and began talking
 28144	to him, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, âUncleâ
 28145	deigned to speak to him.
 28146	
 28147	
 28148	
 28149	
 28150	
 28151	CHAPTER VII
 28152	
 28153	Toward evening IlÃ¡gin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they were
 28154	so far from home that he accepted âUncleâsâ offer that the hunting
 28155	party should spend the night in his little village of MikhÃ¡ylovna.
 28156	
 28157	âAnd if you put up at my house that will be better still. Thatâs it,
 28158	come on!â said âUncle.â âYou see itâs damp weather, and you
 28159	could rest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.â
 28160	
 28161	âUncleâsâ offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to OtrÃ¡dnoe for
 28162	a trap, while Nicholas rode with NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya to âUncleâsâ
 28163	house.
 28164	
 28165	Some five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front
 28166	porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as
 28167	well as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
 28168	the hunters who were arriving. The presence of NatÃ¡shaâa woman, a
 28169	lady, and on horsebackâraised the curiosity of the serfs to such a
 28170	degree that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and
 28171	unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some
 28172	prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what
 28173	was said about her.
 28174	
 28175	âArÃ­nka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt
 28176	dangles.... See, sheâs got a little hunting horn!â
 28177	
 28178	âGoodness gracious! See her knife?...â
 28179	
 28180	âIsnât she a Tartar!â
 28181	
 28182	âHow is it you didnât go head over heels?â asked the boldest of
 28183	all, addressing NatÃ¡sha directly.
 28184	
 28185	âUncleâ dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which
 28186	stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his
 28187	retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take
 28188	themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to
 28189	receive the guests and the visitors.
 28190	
 28191	The serfs all dispersed. âUncleâ lifted NatÃ¡sha off her horse and
 28192	taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The
 28193	house, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overcleanâit
 28194	did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotlessâbut
 28195	neither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of
 28196	fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.
 28197	
 28198	âUncleâ led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with
 28199	a folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round
 28200	birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where
 28201	there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of SuvÃ³rov, of
 28202	the hostâs father and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The
 28203	study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. âUncleâ asked his visitors
 28204	to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room.
 28205	RugÃ¡y, his back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on the
 28206	sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth. Leading from the study
 28207	was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be
 28208	seen. From behind this came womenâs laughter and whispers. NatÃ¡sha,
 28209	Nicholas, and PÃ©tya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa.
 28210	PÃ©tya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at once. NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas
 28211	were silent. Their faces glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful.
 28212	They looked at one another (now that the hunt was over and they were in
 28213	the house, Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly
 28214	superiority over his sister), NatÃ¡sha gave him a wink, and neither
 28215	refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before
 28216	they had a pretext ready to account for it.
 28217	
 28218	After a while âUncleâ came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and
 28219	small top boots. And NatÃ¡sha felt that this costume, the very one she
 28220	had regarded with surprise and amusement at OtrÃ¡dnoe, was just the
 28221	right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat.
 28222	âUncleâ too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the
 28223	brotherâs and sisterâs laughter (it could never enter his head that
 28224	they might be laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the
 28225	merriment.
 28226	
 28227	âThatâs right, young countess, thatâs it, come on! I never saw
 28228	anyone like her!â said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem
 28229	and, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that
 28230	had been cut short. âSheâs ridden all day like a man, and is as
 28231	fresh as ever!â
 28232	
 28233	Soon after âUncleâsâ reappearance the door was opened, evidently
 28234	from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking
 28235	woman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered
 28236	carrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality in
 28237	her glance and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and, with
 28238	a pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional
 28239	stoutness, which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw
 28240	back her head, this woman (who was âUncleâsâ housekeeper) trod
 28241	very lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her
 28242	plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors
 28243	dâoeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had
 28244	finished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her
 28245	face. âHere I am. I am she! Now do you understand âUncleâ?â her
 28246	expression said to RostÃ³v. How could one help understanding? Not only
 28247	Nicholas, but even NatÃ¡sha understood the meaning of his puckered brow
 28248	and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when
 28249	AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb wine,
 28250	different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with
 28251	buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead, apples,
 28252	nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards she brought
 28253	a freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey, and preserves
 28254	made with sugar.
 28255	
 28256	All this was the fruit of AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovnaâs housekeeping, gathered
 28257	and prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a smack
 28258	of AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness,
 28259	whiteness, and pleasant smiles.
 28260	
 28261	âTake this, little Lady-Countess!â she kept saying, as she offered
 28262	NatÃ¡sha first one thing and then another.
 28263	
 28264	NatÃ¡sha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such
 28265	buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such
 28266	a chicken anywhere. AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna left the room.
 28267	
 28268	After supper, over their cherry brandy, RostÃ³v and âUncleâ talked
 28269	of past and future hunts, of RugÃ¡y and IlÃ¡ginâs dogs, while NatÃ¡sha
 28270	sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried
 28271	several times to wake PÃ©tya that he might eat something, but he
 28272	only muttered incoherent words without waking up. NatÃ¡sha felt so
 28273	lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared
 28274	the trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause, such as
 28275	often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in oneâs own
 28276	house, âUncle,â answering a thought that was in his visitorsâ
 28277	minds, said:
 28278	
 28279	âThis, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come.
 28280	Thatâs it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?â
 28281	
 28282	âUncleâsâ face was very significant and even handsome as he said
 28283	this. Involuntarily RostÃ³v recalled all the good he had heard about
 28284	him from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province
 28285	âUncleâ had the reputation of being the most honorable and
 28286	disinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes,
 28287	chose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a
 28288	justice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused public
 28289	appointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay
 28290	gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in
 28291	summer.
 28292	
 28293	âWhy donât you enter the service, Uncle?â
 28294	
 28295	âI did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. Thatâs it, come
 28296	on! I canât make head or tail of it. Thatâs for youâI havenât
 28297	brains enough. Now, hunting is another matterâthatâs it, come on!
 28298	Open the door, there!â he shouted. âWhy have you shut it?â
 28299	
 28300	The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmenâs room, as they
 28301	called the room for the hunt servants.
 28302	
 28303	There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the
 28304	door into the huntsmenâs room, from which came the clear sounds of a
 28305	balalÃ¡yka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was
 28306	playing. NatÃ¡sha had been listening to those strains for some time and
 28307	now went out into the passage to hear better.
 28308	
 28309	âThatâs MÃ­tka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balalÃ¡yka.
 28310	Iâm fond of it,â said âUncle.â
 28311	
 28312	It was the custom for MÃ­tka to play the balalÃ¡yka in the huntsmenâs
 28313	room when âUncleâ returned from the chase. âUncleâ was fond of
 28314	such music.
 28315	
 28316	âHow good! Really very good!â said Nicholas with some unintentional
 28317	superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him
 28318	very much.
 28319	
 28320	âVery good?â said NatÃ¡sha reproachfully, noticing her brotherâs
 28321	tone. âNot âvery goodâ--itâs simply delicious!â
 28322	
 28323	Just as âUncleâsâ pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had
 28324	seemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that moment,
 28325	seemed to her the acme of musical delight.
 28326	
 28327	âMore, please, more!â cried NatÃ¡sha at the door as soon as the
 28328	balalÃ¡yka ceased. MÃ­tka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming
 28329	the balalÃ¡yka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations.
 28330	âUncleâ sat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side.
 28331	The air was repeated a hundred times. The balalÃ¡yka was retuned several
 28332	times and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did
 28333	not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. AnÃ­sya
 28334	FÃ«dorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.
 28335	
 28336	âYou like listening?â she said to NatÃ¡sha, with a smile extremely
 28337	like âUncleâs.â âThatâs a good player of ours,â she added.
 28338	
 28339	âHe doesnât play that part right!â said âUncleâ suddenly, with
 28340	an energetic gesture. âHere he ought to burst outâthatâs it, come
 28341	on!âought to burst out.â
 28342	
 28343	âDo you play then?â asked NatÃ¡sha.
 28344	
 28345	âUncleâ did not answer, but smiled.
 28346	
 28347	âAnÃ­sya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I
 28348	havenât touched it for a long time. Thatâs itâcome on! Iâve
 28349	given it up.â
 28350	
 28351	AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her
 28352	errand and brought back the guitar.
 28353	
 28354	Without looking at anyone, âUncleâ blew the dust off it and, tapping
 28355	the case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself in
 28356	his armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching
 28357	his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at
 28358	AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then
 28359	quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, not
 28360	My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The
 28361	tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the
 28362	hearts of Nicholas and NatÃ¡sha, arousing in them the same kind of
 28363	sober mirth as radiated from AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovnaâs whole being. AnÃ­sya
 28364	FÃ«dorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing
 28365	out of the room. âUncleâ continued to play correctly, carefully,
 28366	with energetic firmness, looking with a changed and inspired expression
 28367	at the spot where AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna had just stood. Something seemed to
 28368	be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches,
 28369	especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here
 28370	and there, as he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to
 28371	snap.
 28372	
 28373	âLovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!â shouted NatÃ¡sha as soon as
 28374	he had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. âNicholas,
 28375	Nicholas!â she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: âWhat
 28376	is it moves me so?â
 28377	
 28378	Nicholas too was greatly pleased by âUncleâsâ playing, and
 28379	âUncleâ played the piece over again. AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovnaâs smiling
 28380	face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces...
 28381	
 28382	    Fetching water clear and sweet,
 28383	    Stop, dear maiden, I entreatâ
 28384	
 28385	played âUncleâ once more, running his fingers skillfully over the
 28386	strings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.
 28387	
 28388	âGo on, Uncle dear,â NatÃ¡sha wailed in an imploring tone as if her
 28389	life depended on it.
 28390	
 28391	âUncleâ rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of
 28392	them smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck
 28393	a naÃ¯ve and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.
 28394	
 28395	âNow then, niece!â he exclaimed, waving to NatÃ¡sha the hand that
 28396	had just struck a chord.
 28397	
 28398	NatÃ¡sha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to face
 28399	âUncle,â and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her
 28400	shoulders and struck an attitude.
 28401	
 28402	Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an Ã©migrÃ©e
 28403	French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit
 28404	and obtained that manner which the pas de chÃ¢le * would, one would have
 28405	supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were
 28406	those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that âUncleâ had
 28407	expected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and smiled
 28408	triumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that had at
 28409	first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right
 28410	thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.
 28411	
 28412	    * The French shawl dance.
 28413	
 28414	She did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision,
 28415	that AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
 28416	needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she
 28417	watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so
 28418	different from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was
 28419	in AnÃ­sya and in AnÃ­syaâs father and mother and aunt, and in every
 28420	Russian man and woman.
 28421	
 28422	âWell, little countess; thatâs itâcome on!â cried âUncle,â
 28423	with a joyous laugh, having finished the dance. âWell done, niece! Now
 28424	a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you. Thatâs itâcome
 28425	on!â
 28426	
 28427	âHeâs chosen already,â said Nicholas smiling.
 28428	
 28429	âOh?â said âUncleâ in surprise, looking inquiringly at NatÃ¡sha,
 28430	who nodded her head with a happy smile.
 28431	
 28432	âAnd such a one!â she said. But as soon as she had said it a new
 28433	train of thoughts and feelings arose in her. âWhat did Nicholasâ
 28434	smile mean when he said âchosen alreadyâ? Is he glad of it or not?
 28435	It is as if he thought my BolkÃ³nski would not approve of or understand
 28436	our gaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?â she
 28437	thought, and her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a
 28438	second. âDonât dare to think about it,â she said to herself,
 28439	and sat down again smilingly beside âUncle,â begging him to play
 28440	something more.
 28441	
 28442	âUncleâ played another song and a valse; then after a pause he
 28443	cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:
 28444	
 28445	    As âtwas growing dark last night
 28446	    Fell the snow so soft and light...
 28447	
 28448	âUncleâ sang as peasants sing, with full and naÃ¯ve conviction that
 28449	the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes
 28450	of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists
 28451	only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered
 28452	tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. NatÃ¡sha was in
 28453	ecstasies over âUncleâsâ singing. She resolved to give up learning
 28454	the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked âUncleâ for his
 28455	guitar and at once found the chords of the song.
 28456	
 28457	After nine oâclock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent
 28458	to look for them, arrived to fetch NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya. The count and
 28459	countess did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of
 28460	the men.
 28461	
 28462	PÃ©tya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
 28463	traps. NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas got into the other. âUncleâ wrapped
 28464	NatÃ¡sha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness. He
 28465	accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed,
 28466	so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent huntsmen to ride
 28467	in front with lanterns.
 28468	
 28469	âGood-by, dear niece,â his voice called out of the darknessânot
 28470	the voice NatÃ¡sha had known previously, but the one that had sung As
 28471	âtwas growing dark last night.
 28472	
 28473	In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a
 28474	cheerful smell of smoke.
 28475	
 28476	âWhat a darling Uncle is!â said NatÃ¡sha, when they had come out
 28477	onto the highroad.
 28478	
 28479	âYes,â returned Nicholas. âYouâre not cold?â
 28480	
 28481	âNo. Iâm quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!â answered
 28482	NatÃ¡sha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long
 28483	while. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but
 28484	only heard them splashing through the unseen mud.
 28485	
 28486	What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught
 28487	and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did they all
 28488	find place in her? But she was very happy. As they were nearing home she
 28489	suddenly struck up the air of As âtwas growing dark last nightâthe
 28490	tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last
 28491	caught.
 28492	
 28493	âGot it?â said Nicholas.
 28494	
 28495	âWhat were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?â inquired
 28496	NatÃ¡sha.
 28497	
 28498	They were fond of asking one another that question.
 28499	
 28500	âI?â said Nicholas, trying to remember. âWell, you see, first I
 28501	thought that RugÃ¡y, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were
 28502	a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then
 28503	for his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Donât you think so?...
 28504	Well, and you?â
 28505	
 28506	âI? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving
 28507	along and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows
 28508	where we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and
 28509	suddenly find that we are not in OtrÃ¡dnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I
 28510	thought... No, nothing else.â
 28511	
 28512	âI know, I expect you thought of him,â said Nicholas, smiling as
 28513	NatÃ¡sha knew by the sound of his voice.
 28514	
 28515	âNo,â said NatÃ¡sha, though she had in reality been thinking about
 28516	Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would
 28517	have liked âUncle.â âAnd then I was saying to myself all the way,
 28518	âHow well AnÃ­sya carried herself, how well!ââ And Nicholas heard
 28519	her spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. âAnd do you know,â she
 28520	suddenly said, âI know that I shall never again be as happy and
 28521	tranquil as I am now.â
 28522	
 28523	âRubbish, nonsense, humbug!â exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought:
 28524	âHow charming this NatÃ¡sha of mine is! I have no other friend like
 28525	her and never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive
 28526	about together!â
 28527	
 28528	âWhat a darling this Nicholas of mine is!â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 28529	
 28530	âAh, there are still lights in the drawing room!â she said, pointing
 28531	to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety
 28532	darkness of the night.
 28533	
 28534	
 28535	
 28536	
 28537	
 28538	CHAPTER VIII
 28539	
 28540	Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility
 28541	because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs
 28542	did not improve. NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas often noticed their parents
 28543	conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of
 28544	selling the fine ancestral RostÃ³v house and estate near Moscow. It was
 28545	not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal,
 28546	and life at OtrÃ¡dnoe was quieter than in former years, but still the
 28547	enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty
 28548	sat down to table every day. These were all their own people who had
 28549	settled down in the house almost as members of the family, or persons
 28550	who were, it seemed, obliged to live in the countâs house. Such were
 28551	Dimmler the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his
 28552	family, BelÃ³va, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many
 28553	others such as PÃ©tyaâs tutors, the girlsâ former governess, and
 28554	other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to
 28555	live in the countâs house than at home. They had not as many visitors
 28556	as before, but the old habits of life without which the count and
 28557	countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged. There was
 28558	still the hunting establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged, the
 28559	same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive
 28560	presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days; there
 28561	were still the countâs games of whist and boston, at whichâspreading
 28562	out his cards so that everybody could see themâhe let himself be
 28563	plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors, who looked
 28564	upon an opportunity to play a rubber with Count RostÃ³v as a most
 28565	profitable source of income.
 28566	
 28567	The count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to believe
 28568	that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step, and
 28569	feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and
 28570	patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her loving heart, felt
 28571	that her children were being ruined, that it was not the countâs fault
 28572	for he could not help being what he wasâthat (though he tried to
 28573	hide it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and
 28574	his childrenâs ruin, and she tried to find means of remedying the
 28575	position. From her feminine point of view she could see only one
 28576	solution, namely, for Nicholas to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to
 28577	be their last hope and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found
 28578	for him, she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters
 28579	right. This match was with Julie KarÃ¡gina, the daughter of excellent
 28580	and virtuous parents, a girl the RostÃ³vs had known from childhood, and
 28581	who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of
 28582	her brothers.
 28583	
 28584	The countess had written direct to Julieâs mother in Moscow suggesting
 28585	a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer
 28586	from her. KarÃ¡gina had replied that for her part she was agreeable, and
 28587	everything depend on her daughterâs inclination. She invited Nicholas
 28588	to come to Moscow.
 28589	
 28590	Several times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son that
 28591	now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him
 28592	married. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that
 28593	were accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl
 28594	and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.
 28595	
 28596	At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to
 28597	Moscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his
 28598	motherâs remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations
 28599	induced her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope
 28600	of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie
 28601	KarÃ¡gina.
 28602	
 28603	âBut, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would
 28604	you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of
 28605	money?â he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question
 28606	and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.
 28607	
 28608	âNo, you have not understood me,â said his mother, not knowing how
 28609	to justify herself. âYou have not understood me, NikÃ³lenka. It is
 28610	your happiness I wish for,â she added, feeling that she was telling an
 28611	untruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.
 28612	
 28613	âMamma, donât cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I
 28614	will give my life, anything, to put you at ease,â said Nicholas. âI
 28615	would sacrifice anything for youâeven my feelings.â
 28616	
 28617	But the countess did not want the question put like that: she did not
 28618	want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice
 28619	for him.
 28620	
 28621	âNo, you have not understood me, donât let us talk about it,â she
 28622	replied, wiping away her tears.
 28623	
 28624	âMaybe I do love a poor girl,â said Nicholas to himself. âAm I to
 28625	sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could
 28626	speak so to me. Because SÃ³nya is poor I must not love her,â he
 28627	thought, âmust not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should
 28628	certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can
 28629	always sacrifice my feelings for my familyâs welfare,â he said to
 28630	himself, âbut I canât coerce my feelings. If I love SÃ³nya, that
 28631	feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.â
 28632	
 28633	Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the
 28634	conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and sometimes
 28635	with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and
 28636	the portionless SÃ³nya. Though she blamed herself for it, she could
 28637	not refrain from grumbling at and worrying SÃ³nya, often pulling her up
 28638	without reason, addressing her stiffly as âmy dear,â and using the
 28639	formal âyouâ instead of the intimate âthouâ in speaking to her.
 28640	The kindhearted countess was the more vexed with SÃ³nya because that
 28641	poor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly
 28642	grateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and
 28643	unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for
 28644	finding fault with her.
 28645	
 28646	Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter had
 28647	come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he would have
 28648	been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly
 28649	reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to defer his return till
 28650	the beginning of the new year. NatÃ¡sha was still as much in love with
 28651	her betrothed, found the same comfort in that love, and was still as
 28652	ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at
 28653	the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits
 28654	of depression which she could not master. She felt sorry for herself:
 28655	sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to
 28656	anyoneâwhile she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved.
 28657	
 28658	Things were not cheerful in the RostÃ³vsâ home.
 28659	
 28660	
 28661	
 28662	
 28663	
 28664	CHAPTER IX
 28665	
 28666	Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and
 28667	wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and the
 28668	new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities, though
 28669	the calm frost of twenty degrees RÃ©aumur, the dazzling sunshine by day,
 28670	and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special
 28671	celebration of the season.
 28672	
 28673	On the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the
 28674	inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest time
 28675	of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that morning,
 28676	was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was resting in his
 28677	study. SÃ³nya sat in the drawing room at the round table, copying a
 28678	design for embroidery. The countess was playing patience. NastÃ¡sya
 28679	IvÃ¡novna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old
 28680	ladies. NatÃ¡sha came into the room, went up to SÃ³nya, glanced at
 28681	what she was doing, and then went up to her mother and stood without
 28682	speaking.
 28683	
 28684	âWhy are you wandering about like an outcast?â asked her mother.
 28685	âWhat do you want?â
 28686	
 28687	âHim... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!â said NatÃ¡sha,
 28688	with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.
 28689	
 28690	The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.
 28691	
 28692	âDonât look at me, Mamma! Donât look; I shall cry directly.â
 28693	
 28694	âSit down with me a little,â said the countess.
 28695	
 28696	âMamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?â
 28697	
 28698	Her voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned quickly to
 28699	hide them and left the room.
 28700	
 28701	She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then
 28702	went into the maidsâ room. There an old maidservant was grumbling at
 28703	a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold from
 28704	the serfsâ quarters.
 28705	
 28706	âStop playingâthereâs a time for everything,â said the old
 28707	woman.
 28708	
 28709	âLet her alone, KondrÃ¡tevna,â said NatÃ¡sha. âGo, MavrÃºshka,
 28710	go.â
 28711	
 28712	Having released MavrÃºshka, NatÃ¡sha crossed the dancing hall and went
 28713	to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing
 28714	cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.
 28715	
 28716	âWhat can I do with them?â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 28717	
 28718	âOh, NikÃ­ta, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the
 28719	yard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some
 28720	oats.â
 28721	
 28722	âJust a few oats?â said Misha, cheerfully and readily.
 28723	
 28724	âGo, go quickly,â the old man urged him.
 28725	
 28726	âAnd you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.â
 28727	
 28728	On her way past the butlerâs pantry she told them to set a samovar,
 28729	though it was not at all the time for tea.
 28730	
 28731	FÃ³ka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.
 28732	NatÃ¡sha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and
 28733	asked whether the samovar was really wanted.
 28734	
 28735	âOh dear, what a young lady!â said FÃ³ka, pretending to frown at
 28736	NatÃ¡sha.
 28737	
 28738	No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as
 28739	NatÃ¡sha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send
 28740	them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of them would
 28741	get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no oneâs orders
 28742	so readily as they did hers. âWhat can I do, where can I go?â
 28743	thought she, as she went slowly along the passage.
 28744	
 28745	âNastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna, what sort of children shall I have?â she asked
 28746	the buffoon, who was coming toward her in a womanâs jacket.
 28747	
 28748	âWhy, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,â answered the buffoon.
 28749	
 28750	âO Lord, O Lord, itâs always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What
 28751	am I to do with myself?â And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly
 28752	upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.
 28753	
 28754	Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were
 28755	plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were discussing
 28756	whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. NatÃ¡sha sat down,
 28757	listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air, and then got
 28758	up again.
 28759	
 28760	âThe island of Madagascar,â she said, âMa-da-gas-car,â she
 28761	repeated, articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to
 28762	Madame Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the
 28763	room.
 28764	
 28765	Her brother PÃ©tya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on him
 28766	he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.
 28767	
 28768	âPÃ©tya! PÃ©tya!â she called to him. âCarry me downstairs.â
 28769	
 28770	PÃ©tya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her
 28771	arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.
 28772	
 28773	âNo, donât... the island of Madagascar!â she said, and jumping off
 28774	his back she went downstairs.
 28775	
 28776	Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made
 28777	sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dull,
 28778	NatÃ¡sha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down
 28779	in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over
 28780	the strings in the bass, picking out a passage she recalled from an
 28781	opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew. What she drew from
 28782	the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners, but in her
 28783	imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds.
 28784	She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light
 28785	escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered. She
 28786	was in a mood for brooding on the past.
 28787	
 28788	SÃ³nya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. NatÃ¡sha glanced
 28789	at her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that
 28790	she remembered the light falling through that crack once before and
 28791	SÃ³nya passing with a glass in her hand. âYes it was exactly the
 28792	same,â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 28793	
 28794	âSÃ³nya, what is this?â she cried, twanging a thick string.
 28795	
 28796	âOh, you are there!â said SÃ³nya with a start, and came near and
 28797	listened. âI donât know. A storm?â she ventured timidly, afraid of
 28798	being wrong.
 28799	
 28800	âThere! Thatâs just how she started and just how she came up smiling
 28801	timidly when all this happened before,â thought NatÃ¡sha, âand in
 28802	just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.â
 28803	
 28804	âNo, itâs the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!â and NatÃ¡sha
 28805	sang the air of the chorus so that SÃ³nya should catch it. âWhere were
 28806	you going?â she asked.
 28807	
 28808	âTo change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.â
 28809	
 28810	âYou always find something to do, but I canât,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 28811	âAnd whereâs Nicholas?â
 28812	
 28813	âAsleep, I think.â
 28814	
 28815	âSÃ³nya, go and wake him,â said NatÃ¡sha. âTell him I want him to
 28816	come and sing.â
 28817	
 28818	She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
 28819	before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all regretting
 28820	not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was
 28821	with him and he was looking at her with a loverâs eyes.
 28822	
 28823	âOh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!
 28824	And, worst of all, I am growing oldâthatâs the thing! There wonât
 28825	then be in me what there is now. But perhaps heâll come today, will
 28826	come immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing
 28827	room. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.â She rose,
 28828	put down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.
 28829	
 28830	All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were already
 28831	at the tea table. The servants stood round the tableâbut Prince Andrew
 28832	was not there and life was going on as before.
 28833	
 28834	âAh, here she is!â said the old count, when he saw NatÃ¡sha enter.
 28835	âWell, sit down by me.â But NatÃ¡sha stayed by her mother and
 28836	glanced round as if looking for something.
 28837	
 28838	âMamma!â she muttered, âgive him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,
 28839	quickly!â and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.
 28840	
 28841	She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the
 28842	elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. âMy God, my God!
 28843	The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the
 28844	same way!â thought NatÃ¡sha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion
 28845	rising up in her for the whole household, because they were always the
 28846	same.
 28847	
 28848	After tea, Nicholas, SÃ³nya, and NatÃ¡sha went to the sitting room, to
 28849	their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.
 28850	
 28851	
 28852	
 28853	
 28854	
 28855	CHAPTER X
 28856	
 28857	âDoes it ever happen to you,â said NatÃ¡sha to her brother, when
 28858	they settled down in the sitting room, âdoes it ever happen to you to
 28859	feel as if there were nothing more to comeânothing; that everything
 28860	good is past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?â
 28861	
 28862	âI should think so!â he replied. âI have felt like that when
 28863	everything was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has come
 28864	into my mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must all
 28865	die. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there
 28866	was music... and suddenly I felt so depressed...â
 28867	
 28868	âOh yes, I know, I know, I know!â NatÃ¡sha interrupted him. âWhen
 28869	I was quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when
 28870	I was punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat
 28871	sobbing in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry
 28872	for everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was innocentâthat
 28873	was the chief thing,â said NatÃ¡sha. âDo you remember?â
 28874	
 28875	âI remember,â answered Nicholas. âI remember that I came to you
 28876	afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt ashamed
 28877	to. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and wanted to give
 28878	it to you. Do you remember?â
 28879	
 28880	âAnd do you remember,â NatÃ¡sha asked with a pensive smile, âhow
 28881	once, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us into
 28882	the studyâthat was in the old houseâand it was darkâwe went in and
 28883	suddenly there stood...â
 28884	
 28885	âA Negro,â chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. âOf course
 28886	I remember. Even now I donât know whether there really was a Negro, or
 28887	if we only dreamed it or were told about him.â
 28888	
 28889	âHe was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked
 28890	at us....â
 28891	
 28892	âSÃ³nya, do you remember?â asked Nicholas.
 28893	
 28894	âYes, yes, I do remember something too,â SÃ³nya answered timidly.
 28895	
 28896	âYou know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,â said
 28897	NatÃ¡sha, âand they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you
 28898	remember!â
 28899	
 28900	âOf course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.â
 28901	
 28902	âHow strange it is! Itâs as if it were a dream! I like that.â
 28903	
 28904	âAnd do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom,
 28905	and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was that
 28906	real or not? Do you remember what fun it was?â
 28907	
 28908	âYes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in
 28909	the porch?â
 28910	
 28911	So they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not the sad
 28912	memories of old age, but poetic, youthful onesâthose impressions of
 28913	oneâs most distant past in which dreams and realities blendâand they
 28914	laughed with quiet enjoyment.
 28915	
 28916	SÃ³nya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared
 28917	the same reminiscences.
 28918	
 28919	Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she
 28920	recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. She
 28921	simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.
 28922	
 28923	She only really took part when they recalled SÃ³nyaâs first arrival.
 28924	She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a
 28925	corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too, would be sewn up
 28926	with cords.
 28927	
 28928	âAnd I remember their telling me that you had been born under a
 28929	cabbage,â said NatÃ¡sha, âand I remember that I dared not disbelieve
 28930	it then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.â
 28931	
 28932	While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of
 28933	the sitting room.
 28934	
 28935	âThey have brought the cock, Miss,â she said in a whisper.
 28936	
 28937	âIt isnât wanted, PÃ³lya. Tell them to take it away,â replied
 28938	NatÃ¡sha.
 28939	
 28940	In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and
 28941	went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth
 28942	covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.
 28943	
 28944	âMr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,â came the
 28945	old countessâ voice from the drawing room.
 28946	
 28947	Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to NatÃ¡sha, Nicholas, and SÃ³nya,
 28948	remarked: âHow quiet you young people are!â
 28949	
 28950	âYes, weâre philosophizing,â said NatÃ¡sha, glancing round for a
 28951	moment and then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing
 28952	dreams.
 28953	
 28954	Dimmler began to play; NatÃ¡sha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table,
 28955	took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly
 28956	in her former place. It was dark in the room especially where they were
 28957	sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of
 28958	the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but
 28959	still sat softly running his fingers over the strings, evidently
 28960	uncertain whether to stop or to play something else.
 28961	
 28962	âDo you know,â said NatÃ¡sha in a whisper, moving closer to Nicholas
 28963	and SÃ³nya, âthat when one goes on and on recalling memories, one at
 28964	last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world....â
 28965	
 28966	âThat is metempsychosis,â said SÃ³nya, who had always learned well,
 28967	and remembered everything. âThe Egyptians believed that our souls have
 28968	lived in animals, and will go back into animals again.â
 28969	
 28970	âNo, I donât believe we ever were in animals,â said NatÃ¡sha,
 28971	still in a whisper though the music had ceased. âBut I am certain that
 28972	we were angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we
 28973	remember....â
 28974	
 28975	âMay I join you?â said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat
 28976	down by them.
 28977	
 28978	âIf we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?â said Nicholas.
 28979	âNo, that canât be!â
 28980	
 28981	âNot lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I
 28982	was before?â NatÃ¡sha rejoined with conviction. âThe soul is
 28983	immortalâwell then, if I shall always live I must have lived before,
 28984	lived for a whole eternity.â
 28985	
 28986	âYes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,â remarked Dimmler,
 28987	who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now
 28988	spoke as quietly and seriously as they.
 28989	
 28990	âWhy is it hard to imagine eternity?â said NatÃ¡sha. âIt is now
 28991	today, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, and
 28992	the day before....â
 28993	
 28994	âNatÃ¡sha! Now itâs your turn. Sing me something,â they heard the
 28995	countess say. âWhy are you sitting there like conspirators?â
 28996	
 28997	âMamma, I donât at all want to,â replied NatÃ¡sha, but all the
 28998	same she rose.
 28999	
 29000	None of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break off
 29001	their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but
 29002	NatÃ¡sha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing
 29003	as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the
 29004	resonance was best, NatÃ¡sha began to sing her motherâs favorite song.
 29005	
 29006	She had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had
 29007	sung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The
 29008	count, from his study where he was talking to MÃ­tenka, heard her and,
 29009	like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk
 29010	while giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped, while MÃ­tenka
 29011	stood in front of him also listening and smiling. Nicholas did not take
 29012	his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her. SÃ³nya, as she
 29013	listened, thought of the immense difference there was between herself
 29014	and her friend, and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as
 29015	bewitching as her cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad
 29016	smile and with tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She
 29017	thought of NatÃ¡sha and of her own youth, and of how there was something
 29018	unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of NatÃ¡sha and Prince
 29019	Andrew.
 29020	
 29021	Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with
 29022	closed eyes.
 29023	
 29024	âAh, Countess,â he said at last, âthatâs a European talent, she
 29025	has nothing to learnâwhat softness, tenderness, and strength....â
 29026	
 29027	âAh, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!â said the countess,
 29028	not realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her
 29029	that NatÃ¡sha had too much of something, and that because of this
 29030	she would not be happy. Before NatÃ¡sha had finished singing,
 29031	fourteen-year-old PÃ©tya rushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers
 29032	had arrived.
 29033	
 29034	NatÃ¡sha stopped abruptly.
 29035	
 29036	âIdiot!â she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair, threw
 29037	herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long
 29038	time.
 29039	
 29040	âItâs nothing, Mamma, really itâs nothing; only PÃ©tya startled
 29041	me,â she said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs
 29042	still choked her.
 29043	
 29044	The mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,
 29045	innkeepers, and ladiesâfrightening and funnyâbringing in with
 29046	them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first
 29047	timidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed
 29048	into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily
 29049	and heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas
 29050	games. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their
 29051	costumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom,
 29052	smiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had
 29053	disappeared.
 29054	
 29055	Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
 29056	ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirtâthis was Nicholas. A Turkish
 29057	girl was PÃ©tya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was NatÃ¡sha, and a
 29058	Circassian was SÃ³nya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.
 29059	
 29060	After the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those
 29061	who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their
 29062	costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere.
 29063	
 29064	Nicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to take
 29065	them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them about a
 29066	dozen of the serf mummers and drive to âUncleâs.â
 29067	
 29068	âNo, why disturb the old fellow?â said the countess. âBesides,
 29069	you wouldnât have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the
 29070	MelyukÃ³vsâ.â
 29071	
 29072	MelyukÃ³va was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and
 29073	governesses, lived three miles from the RostÃ³vs.
 29074	
 29075	âThatâs right, my dear,â chimed in the old count, thoroughly
 29076	aroused. âIâll dress up at once and go with them. Iâll make
 29077	Pashette open her eyes.â
 29078	
 29079	But the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all
 29080	these last days. It was decided that the count must not go, but that if
 29081	Louisa IvÃ¡novna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the young ladies
 29082	might go to the MelyukÃ³vsâ, SÃ³nya, generally so timid and shy, more
 29083	urgently than anyone begging Louisa IvÃ¡novna not to refuse.
 29084	
 29085	SÃ³nyaâs costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were
 29086	extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome,
 29087	and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some
 29088	inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and
 29089	in her male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa IvÃ¡novna
 29090	consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and
 29091	small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow,
 29092	drove up to the porch.
 29093	
 29094	NatÃ¡sha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing
 29095	from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all
 29096	came out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to
 29097	one another, laughing, and shouting.
 29098	
 29099	Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the
 29100	old countâs with a trotter from the OrlÃ³v stud as shaft horse,
 29101	the fourth was Nicholasâ own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.
 29102	Nicholas, in his old ladyâs dress over which he had belted his hussar
 29103	overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.
 29104	
 29105	It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal
 29106	harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm
 29107	at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.
 29108	
 29109	NatÃ¡sha, SÃ³nya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholasâ
 29110	sleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and PÃ©tya, into the old countâs, and the
 29111	rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.
 29112	
 29113	âYou go ahead, ZakhÃ¡r!â shouted Nicholas to his fatherâs
 29114	coachman, wishing for a chance to race past him.
 29115	
 29116	The old countâs troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,
 29117	squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its deep-toned
 29118	bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the
 29119	middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar,
 29120	and threw it up.
 29121	
 29122	Nicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others
 29123	moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove at a steady
 29124	trot along the narrow road. While they drove past the garden the shadows
 29125	of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant
 29126	moonlight, but as soon as they were past the fence, the snowy plain
 29127	bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering
 29128	like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the
 29129	first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road, and each of
 29130	the other sleighs jolted in the same way, and rudely breaking the
 29131	frost-bound stillness, the troykas began to speed along the road, one
 29132	after the other.
 29133	
 29134	âA hareâs track, a lot of tracks!â rang out NatÃ¡shaâs voice
 29135	through the frost-bound air.
 29136	
 29137	âHow light it is, Nicholas!â came SÃ³nyaâs voice.
 29138	
 29139	Nicholas glanced round at SÃ³nya, and bent down to see her face closer.
 29140	Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up
 29141	at him from her sable fursâso close and yet so distantâin the
 29142	moonlight.
 29143	
 29144	âThat used to be SÃ³nya,â thought he, and looked at her closer and
 29145	smiled.
 29146	
 29147	âWhat is it, Nicholas?â
 29148	
 29149	âNothing,â said he and turned again to the horses.
 29150	
 29151	When they came out onto the beaten highroadâpolished by sleigh runners
 29152	and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in the
 29153	moonlightâthe horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and
 29154	increased their pace. The near side horse, arching his head and breaking
 29155	into a short canter, tugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed from
 29156	side to side, moving his ears as if asking: âIsnât it time to begin
 29157	now?â In front, already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing
 29158	farther and farther off, the black horses driven by ZakhÃ¡r could be
 29159	clearly seen against the white snow. From that sleigh one could hear the
 29160	shouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.
 29161	
 29162	âGee up, my darlings!â shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one
 29163	side and flourishing the whip.
 29164	
 29165	It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the
 29166	side horses who pulled harderâever increasing their gallopâthat
 29167	one noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With
 29168	screams, squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
 29169	to gallopâthe other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily
 29170	beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and
 29171	ready to put on speed when required.
 29172	
 29173	Nicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and
 29174	coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.
 29175	
 29176	âWhere are we?â thought he. âItâs the KosÃ³y meadow, I suppose.
 29177	But noâthis is something new Iâve never seen before. This isnât
 29178	the KosÃ³y meadow nor the DÃ«mkin hill, and heaven only knows what it
 29179	is! It is something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be...â
 29180	And shouting to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.
 29181	
 29182	ZakhÃ¡r held back his horses and turned his face, which was already
 29183	covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.
 29184	
 29185	Nicholas gave the horses the rein, and ZakhÃ¡r, stretching out his arms,
 29186	clucked his tongue and let his horses go.
 29187	
 29188	âNow, look out, master!â he cried.
 29189	
 29190	Faster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved
 29191	the feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead.
 29192	ZakhÃ¡r, while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the
 29193	reins.
 29194	
 29195	âNo you wonât, master!â he shouted.
 29196	
 29197	Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed ZakhÃ¡r. The horses
 29198	showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleighâbeside
 29199	them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of
 29200	swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing.
 29201	The whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls
 29202	shrieking were heard from different sides.
 29203	
 29204	Again checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were still
 29205	surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with
 29206	stars.
 29207	
 29208	âZakhÃ¡r is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the
 29209	left?â thought Nicholas. âAre we getting to the MelyukÃ³vsâ? Is
 29210	this MelyukÃ³vka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows
 29211	what is happening to usâbut it is very strange and pleasant whatever
 29212	it is.â And he looked round in the sleigh.
 29213	
 29214	âLook, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!â said one of the
 29215	strange, pretty, unfamiliar peopleâthe one with fine eyebrows and
 29216	mustache.
 29217	
 29218	âI think this used to be NatÃ¡sha,â thought Nicholas, âand that
 29219	was Madame Schoss, but perhaps itâs not, and this Circassian with the
 29220	mustache I donât know, but I love her.â
 29221	
 29222	âArenât you cold?â he asked.
 29223	
 29224	They did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh behind
 29225	shouted somethingâprobably something funnyâbut they could not make
 29226	out what he said.
 29227	
 29228	âYes, yes!â some voices answered, laughing.
 29229	
 29230	âBut here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a glitter
 29231	of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy
 29232	buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And if this is really
 29233	MelyukÃ³vka, it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and
 29234	have come to MelyukÃ³vka,â thought Nicholas.
 29235	
 29236	It really was MelyukÃ³vka, and maids and footmen with merry faces came
 29237	running, out to the porch carrying candles.
 29238	
 29239	âWho is it?â asked someone in the porch.
 29240	
 29241	âThe mummers from the countâs. I know by the horses,â replied some
 29242	voices.
 29243	
 29244	
 29245	
 29246	
 29247	
 29248	CHAPTER XI
 29249	
 29250	PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna MelyukÃ³va, a broadly built, energetic woman
 29251	wearing spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded
 29252	by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull. They
 29253	were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows
 29254	the wax figures would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and
 29255	voices of new arrivals in the vestibule.
 29256	
 29257	Hussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their
 29258	throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule,
 29259	came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The
 29260	clownâDimmlerâand the ladyâNicholasâstarted a dance. Surrounded
 29261	by the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and
 29262	disguising their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves
 29263	about the room.
 29264	
 29265	âDear me! thereâs no recognizing them! And NatÃ¡sha! See whom
 29266	she looks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr
 29267	Dimmlerâisnât he good! I didnât know him! And how he dances. Dear
 29268	me, thereâs a Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear SÃ³nya.
 29269	And who is that? Well, you have cheered us up! NikÃ­ta and Vanyaâclear
 29270	away the tables! And we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The
 29271	hussar, the hussar! Just like a boy! And the legs!... I canât look at
 29272	him...â different voices were saying.
 29273	
 29274	NatÃ¡sha, the young MelyukÃ³vsâ favorite, disappeared with them into
 29275	the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments
 29276	were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from
 29277	behind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young MelyukÃ³vs joined the
 29278	mummers.
 29279	
 29280	PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the
 29281	visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,
 29282	went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles, peering
 29283	into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any
 29284	of them. It was not merely Dimmler and the RostÃ³vs she failed to
 29285	recognize, she did not even recognize her own daughters, or her late
 29286	husbandâs, dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put on.
 29287	
 29288	âAnd who is this?â she asked her governess, peering into the face of
 29289	her own daughter dressed up as a KazÃ¡n-Tartar. âI suppose it is one
 29290	of the RostÃ³vs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve in?â
 29291	she asked NatÃ¡sha. âHere, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!â
 29292	she ordered the butler who was handing things round. âThatâs not
 29293	forbidden by his law.â
 29294	
 29295	Sometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the
 29296	dancers, whoâhaving decided once for all that being disguised, no one
 29297	would recognize themâwere not at all shy, PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna hid
 29298	her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with
 29299	irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.
 29300	
 29301	âMy little SÃ¡sha! Look at SÃ¡sha!â she said.
 29302	
 29303	After Russian country dances and chorus dances, PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna
 29304	made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string,
 29305	and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together.
 29306	
 29307	In an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The corked
 29308	eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed,
 29309	and merry faces. PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna began to recognize the mummers,
 29310	admired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they
 29311	suited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained
 29312	her so well. The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room,
 29313	and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom.
 29314	
 29315	âNow to tell oneâs fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!â
 29316	said an old maid who lived with the MelyukÃ³vs, during supper.
 29317	
 29318	âWhy?â said the eldest MelyukÃ³v girl.
 29319	
 29320	âYou wouldnât go, it takes courage....â
 29321	
 29322	âIâll go,â said SÃ³nya.
 29323	
 29324	âTell what happened to the young lady!â said the second MelyukÃ³v
 29325	girl.
 29326	
 29327	âWell,â began the old maid, âa young lady once went out, took a
 29328	cock, laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After sitting
 29329	a while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh drives up with
 29330	harness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in, just in the shape of a
 29331	man, like an officerâcomes in and sits down to table with her.â
 29332	
 29333	âAh! ah!â screamed NatÃ¡sha, rolling her eyes with horror.
 29334	
 29335	âYes? And how... did he speak?â
 29336	
 29337	âYes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began persuading
 29338	her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got
 29339	frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands. Then he
 29340	caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just then....â
 29341	
 29342	âNow, why frighten them?â said PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna.
 29343	
 29344	âMamma, you used to try your fate yourself...â said her daughter.
 29345	
 29346	âAnd how does one do it in a barn?â inquired SÃ³nya.
 29347	
 29348	âWell, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on what
 29349	you hear; hammering and knockingâthatâs bad; but a sound of shifting
 29350	grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.â
 29351	
 29352	âMamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.â
 29353	
 29354	PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna smiled.
 29355	
 29356	âOh, Iâve forgotten...â she replied. âBut none of you would
 29357	go?â
 29358	
 29359	âYes, I will; PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna, let me! Iâll go,â said SÃ³nya.
 29360	
 29361	âWell, why not, if youâre not afraid?â
 29362	
 29363	âLouisa IvÃ¡novna, may I?â asked SÃ³nya.
 29364	
 29365	Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or
 29366	talking as now, Nicholas did not leave SÃ³nyaâs side, and gazed at her
 29367	with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks
 29368	to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her. And
 29369	really, that evening, SÃ³nya was brighter, more animated, and prettier
 29370	than Nicholas had ever seen her before.
 29371	
 29372	âSo thatâs what she is like; what a fool I have been!â he thought
 29373	gazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous
 29374	smile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.
 29375	
 29376	âIâm not afraid of anything,â said SÃ³nya. âMay I go at once?â
 29377	She got up.
 29378	
 29379	They told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen,
 29380	and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and
 29381	shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.
 29382	
 29383	âWhat a darling that girl is!â thought he. âAnd what have I been
 29384	thinking of till now?â
 29385	
 29386	SÃ³nya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went
 29387	hastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people
 29388	really had made the house stuffy.
 29389	
 29390	Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even
 29391	brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with
 29392	so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real
 29393	stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was
 29394	gay.
 29395	
 29396	âI am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?â thought
 29397	Nicholas, and running out from the porch he went round the corner of
 29398	the house and along the path that led to the back porch. He knew SÃ³nya
 29399	would pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and
 29400	across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees
 29401	fell on the snow and on the path. This path led to the barn. The log
 29402	walls of the barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out
 29403	of some precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A tree in the garden
 29404	snapped with the frost, and then all was again perfectly silent. His
 29405	bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and
 29406	gladness.
 29407	
 29408	From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the
 29409	bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard
 29410	the voice of an old maidservant saying, âStraight, straight, along the
 29411	path, Miss. Only, donât look back.â
 29412	
 29413	âI am not afraid,â answered SÃ³nyaâs voice, and along the path
 29414	toward Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of SÃ³nyaâs feet
 29415	in her thin shoes.
 29416	
 29417	SÃ³nya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of paces
 29418	away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had
 29419	known and always slightly feared. He was in a womanâs dress, with
 29420	tousled hair and a happy smile new to SÃ³nya. She ran rapidly toward
 29421	him.
 29422	
 29423	âQuite different and yet the same,â thought Nicholas, looking at her
 29424	face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak
 29425	that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her
 29426	on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork. SÃ³nya
 29427	kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed
 29428	them to his cheeks.
 29429	
 29430	âSÃ³nya!... Nicholas!â... was all they said. They ran to the barn
 29431	and then back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back
 29432	porch.
 29433	
 29434	
 29435	
 29436	
 29437	
 29438	CHAPTER XII
 29439	
 29440	When they all drove back from PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovnaâs, NatÃ¡sha, who
 29441	always saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss
 29442	should go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and SÃ³nya with Nicholas and
 29443	the maids.
 29444	
 29445	On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and
 29446	kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into SÃ³nyaâs
 29447	face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and
 29448	his present SÃ³nya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again.
 29449	He looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new SÃ³nya, and
 29450	being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss,
 29451	inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and, looking at the ground
 29452	flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in
 29453	fairyland.
 29454	
 29455	âSÃ³nya, is it well with thee?â he asked from time to time.
 29456	
 29457	âYes!â she replied. âAnd with thee?â
 29458	
 29459	When halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for
 29460	a moment to NatÃ¡shaâs sleigh and stood on its wing.
 29461	
 29462	âNatÃ¡sha!â he whispered in French, âdo you know I have made up my
 29463	mind about SÃ³nya?â
 29464	
 29465	âHave you told her?â asked NatÃ¡sha, suddenly beaming all over with
 29466	joy.
 29467	
 29468	âOh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...
 29469	NatÃ¡shaâare you glad?â
 29470	
 29471	âI am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I did
 29472	not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she
 29473	has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy
 29474	while SÃ³nya was not,â continued NatÃ¡sha. âNow I am so glad! Well,
 29475	run back to her.â
 29476	
 29477	âNo, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!â cried Nicholas, peering
 29478	into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and
 29479	bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before. âNatÃ¡sha,
 29480	itâs magical, isnât it?â
 29481	
 29482	âYes,â she replied. âYou have done splendidly.â
 29483	
 29484	âHad I seen her before as she is now,â thought Nicholas, âI should
 29485	long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me,
 29486	and all would have been well.â
 29487	
 29488	âSo you are glad and I have done right?â
 29489	
 29490	âOh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it.
 29491	Mamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing! I
 29492	nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of
 29493	SÃ³nya, for there is nothing but good in her.â
 29494	
 29495	âThen itâs all right?â said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the
 29496	expression of his sisterâs face to see if she was in earnest. Then he
 29497	jumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his sleigh.
 29498	The same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and beaming eyes
 29499	looking up from under a sable hood, was still sitting there, and that
 29500	Circassian was SÃ³nya, and that SÃ³nya was certainly his future happy
 29501	and loving wife.
 29502	
 29503	When they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the
 29504	evening at the MelyukÃ³vsâ, the girls went to their bedroom. When they
 29505	had undressed, but without washing off the cork mustaches, they sat a
 29506	long time talking of their happiness. They talked of how they would live
 29507	when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how
 29508	happy they would be. On NatÃ¡shaâs table stood two looking glasses
 29509	which DunyÃ¡sha had prepared beforehand.
 29510	
 29511	âOnly when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too
 29512	good!â said NatÃ¡sha, rising and going to the looking glasses.
 29513	
 29514	âSit down, NatÃ¡sha; perhaps youâll see him,â said SÃ³nya.
 29515	
 29516	NatÃ¡sha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking
 29517	glasses, and sat down.
 29518	
 29519	âI see someone with a mustache,â said NatÃ¡sha, seeing her own face.
 29520	
 29521	âYou mustnât laugh, Miss,â said DunyÃ¡sha.
 29522	
 29523	With SÃ³nyaâs help and the maidâs, NatÃ¡sha got the glass she held
 29524	into the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious
 29525	expression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the
 29526	receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting (from
 29527	tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew, in that
 29528	last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was to take the
 29529	smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin, she saw nothing.
 29530	She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses.
 29531	
 29532	âWhy is it others see things and I donât?â she said. âYou sit
 29533	down now, SÃ³nya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I
 29534	feel so frightened!â
 29535	
 29536	SÃ³nya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began
 29537	looking.
 29538	
 29539	âNow, Miss SÃ³nya is sure to see something,â whispered DunyÃ¡sha;
 29540	âwhile you do nothing but laugh.â
 29541	
 29542	SÃ³nya heard this and NatÃ¡shaâs whisper:
 29543	
 29544	âI know she will. She saw something last year.â
 29545	
 29546	For about three minutes all were silent.
 29547	
 29548	âOf course she will!â whispered NatÃ¡sha, but did not finish...
 29549	suddenly SÃ³nya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her
 29550	eyes with her hand.
 29551	
 29552	âOh, NatÃ¡sha!â she cried.
 29553	
 29554	âDid you see? Did you? What was it?â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha, holding up
 29555	the looking glass.
 29556	
 29557	SÃ³nya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to get
 29558	up when she heard NatÃ¡sha say, âOf course she will!â She did not
 29559	wish to disappoint either DunyÃ¡sha or NatÃ¡sha, but it was hard to sit
 29560	still. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her
 29561	when she covered her eyes.
 29562	
 29563	âYou saw him?â urged NatÃ¡sha, seizing her hand.
 29564	
 29565	âYes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,â SÃ³nya could not help saying, not
 29566	yet knowing whom NatÃ¡sha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.
 29567	
 29568	âBut why shouldnât I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who
 29569	can tell whether I saw anything or not?â flashed through SÃ³nyaâs
 29570	mind.
 29571	
 29572	âYes, I saw him,â she said.
 29573	
 29574	âHow? Standing or lying?â
 29575	
 29576	âNo, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying
 29577	down.â
 29578	
 29579	âAndrew lying? Is he ill?â asked NatÃ¡sha, her frightened eyes fixed
 29580	on her friend.
 29581	
 29582	âNo, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he
 29583	turned to me.â And when saying this she herself fancied she had really
 29584	seen what she described.
 29585	
 29586	âWell, and then, SÃ³nya?...â
 29587	
 29588	âAfter that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and
 29589	red....â
 29590	
 29591	âSÃ³nya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how
 29592	afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!...â NatÃ¡sha
 29593	began, and without replying to SÃ³nyaâs words of comfort she got into
 29594	bed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless,
 29595	gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.
 29596	
 29597	
 29598	
 29599	
 29600	
 29601	CHAPTER XIII
 29602	
 29603	Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love
 29604	for SÃ³nya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who
 29605	had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
 29606	declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
 29607	might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would
 29608	give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time,
 29609	felt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love
 29610	for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son,
 29611	she sent for her husband and, when he came, tried briefly and coldly to
 29612	inform him of the facts, in her sonâs presence, but unable to restrain
 29613	herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room. The old
 29614	count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his
 29615	purpose. Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word, and his
 29616	father, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and
 29617	went in to the countess. In all his encounters with his son, the count
 29618	was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the
 29619	family fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to
 29620	marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless SÃ³nya. On this occasion, he
 29621	was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not
 29622	been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than SÃ³nya could have
 29623	been wished for, and that no one but himself with his MÃ­tenka and
 29624	his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family
 29625	finances.
 29626	
 29627	The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again,
 29628	but a few days later the countess sent for SÃ³nya and, with a cruelty
 29629	neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch
 29630	Nicholas and for ingratitude. SÃ³nya listened silently with downcast
 29631	eyes to the countessâ cruel words, without understanding what
 29632	was required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her
 29633	benefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case
 29634	she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She could
 29635	not help loving the countess and the whole RostÃ³v family, but neither
 29636	could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended
 29637	on that love. She was silent and sad and did not reply. Nicholas felt
 29638	the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his
 29639	mother. He first implored her to forgive him and SÃ³nya and consent to
 29640	their marriage, then he threatened that if she molested SÃ³nya he would
 29641	at once marry her secretly.
 29642	
 29643	The countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her before,
 29644	replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying without his
 29645	fatherâs consent, and he could do the same, but that she would never
 29646	receive that intriguer as her daughter.
 29647	
 29648	Exploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told
 29649	his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
 29650	feelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time.... But he
 29651	had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face
 29652	caused his mother to await with terror, and which would perhaps have
 29653	forever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had not time to say it,
 29654	for NatÃ¡sha, with a pale and set face, entered the room from the door
 29655	at which she had been listening.
 29656	
 29657	âNicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I
 29658	tell you!...â she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.
 29659	
 29660	âMamma darling, itâs not at all so... my poor, sweet darling,â she
 29661	said to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of
 29662	a rupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and
 29663	excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.
 29664	
 29665	âNicholas, Iâll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,â
 29666	said NatÃ¡sha.
 29667	
 29668	Her words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which she
 29669	was aiming.
 29670	
 29671	The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughterâs breast,
 29672	while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.
 29673	
 29674	NatÃ¡sha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded
 29675	that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that SÃ³nya should not
 29676	be troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
 29677	without his parentsâ knowledge.
 29678	
 29679	Firmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,
 29680	to retire from the army and return and marry SÃ³nya, Nicholas, serious,
 29681	sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,
 29682	passionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his
 29683	regiment.
 29684	
 29685	After Nicholas had gone things in the RostÃ³v household were more
 29686	depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.
 29687	
 29688	SÃ³nya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on
 29689	account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward
 29690	her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his
 29691	affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house and
 29692	estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they had to
 29693	go to Moscow. But the countessâ health obliged them to delay their
 29694	departure from day to day.
 29695	
 29696	NatÃ¡sha, who had borne the first period of separation from her
 29697	betrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and
 29698	impatient every day. The thought that her best days, which she would
 29699	have employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no advantage
 29700	to anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters for the most part
 29701	irritated her. It hurt her to think that while she lived only in the
 29702	thought of him, he was living a real life, seeing new places and new
 29703	people that interested him. The more interesting his letters were
 29704	the more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from giving her any
 29705	comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation. She could
 29706	not write, because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing
 29707	sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by
 29708	voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry
 29709	letters, to which she attached no importance herself, and in the rough
 29710	copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.
 29711	
 29712	There was still no improvement in the countessâ health, but it was
 29713	impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. NatÃ¡shaâs
 29714	trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince Andrew
 29715	was expected in Moscow, where old Prince BolkÃ³nski was spending the
 29716	winter, and NatÃ¡sha felt sure he had already arrived.
 29717	
 29718	So the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking SÃ³nya
 29719	and NatÃ¡sha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.

 29731	CHAPTER I
 29732	
 29733	After Prince Andrewâs engagement to NatÃ¡sha, Pierre without any
 29734	apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before.
 29735	Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his
 29736	benefactor, and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to
 29737	which he had devoted himself with such ardorâall the zest of such a
 29738	life vanished after the engagement of Andrew and NatÃ¡sha and the death
 29739	of Joseph AlexÃ©evich, the news of which reached him almost at the same
 29740	time. Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife
 29741	who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance
 29742	with all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities.
 29743	And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He
 29744	ceased keeping a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began going
 29745	to the club again, drank a great deal, and came once more in touch
 29746	with the bachelor sets, leading such a life that the Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 29747	thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre felt that
 29748	she was right, and to avoid compromising her went away to Moscow.
 29749	
 29750	In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
 29751	fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as,
 29752	driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable
 29753	tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the KrÃ©mlin
 29754	Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and
 29755	hovels of the SÃ­vtsev VrazhÃ³k, those old Moscovites who desired
 29756	nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he
 29757	saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he
 29758	felt himself at home in a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at
 29759	home, warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown.
 29760	
 29761	Moscow society, from the old women down to the children, received Pierre
 29762	like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him.
 29763	For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most intellectual,
 29764	merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial nobleman of
 29765	the old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was open to
 29766	everyone.
 29767	
 29768	Benefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent societies,
 29769	gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons,
 29770	churches, and booksâno one and nothing met with a refusal from him,
 29771	and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from
 29772	him and taken him under their protection, he would have given everything
 29773	away. There was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him. As
 29774	soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux
 29775	he was surrounded, and talking, disputing, and joking began. When there
 29776	were quarrels, his kindly smile and well-timed jests reconciled the
 29777	antagonists. The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not
 29778	there.
 29779	
 29780	When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile,
 29781	yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
 29782	with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men.
 29783	At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies, married and
 29784	unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of them, he was
 29785	equally amiable to all, especially after supper. âIl est charmant; il
 29786	nâa pas de sexe,â * they said of him.
 29787	
 29788	    * âHe is charming; he has no sex.â
 29789	
 29790	
 29791	Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were
 29792	hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.
 29793	
 29794	How horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first
 29795	arrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him
 29796	to seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally
 29797	predetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in
 29798	his position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one
 29799	time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia;
 29800	then himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then
 29801	a strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the
 29802	possibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the sinful
 29803	human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection?
 29804	Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs?
 29805	
 29806	But instead of all thatâhere he was, the wealthy husband of an
 29807	unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and
 29808	drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the government
 29809	a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal favorite in
 29810	Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the
 29811	idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting
 29812	he had so despised seven years before.
 29813	
 29814	Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living
 29815	this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how
 29816	many, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily,
 29817	with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single
 29818	tooth or hair remained.
 29819	
 29820	In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to
 29821	him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired
 29822	gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty, stupid,
 29823	contented fellows, satisfied with their position, âwhile I am still
 29824	discontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all these
 29825	comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a
 29826	path in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of
 29827	circumstances, society, and raceâby that elemental force against which
 29828	man is powerlessâto the condition I am in,â said he to himself in
 29829	moments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer
 29830	despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his
 29831	comrades in destiny, as he pitied himself.
 29832	
 29833	Pierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust
 29834	with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such
 29835	acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment.
 29836	âWhat for? Why? What is going on in the world?â he would ask himself
 29837	in perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to reflect
 29838	anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by experience
 29839	that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away
 29840	from them, and took up a book, or hurried off to the club or to ApollÃ³n
 29841	NikolÃ¡evichâs, to exchange the gossip of the town.
 29842	
 29843	âHÃ©lÃ¨ne, who has never cared for anything but her own body and
 29844	is one of the stupidest women in the world,â thought Pierre, âis
 29845	regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they
 29846	pay homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he
 29847	was great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor
 29848	Francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The
 29849	Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their
 29850	victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French,
 29851	also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same
 29852	fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons swear
 29853	by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their
 29854	neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the
 29855	poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers,
 29856	and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody
 29857	needs, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not
 29858	understand. We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries
 29859	and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have built in
 29860	Moscow forty times forty churchesâbut yesterday a deserter was knouted
 29861	to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a
 29862	priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.â So
 29863	thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone
 29864	accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it
 29865	were something new. âI understand the deception and confusion,â he
 29866	thought, âbut how am I to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and
 29867	have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand
 29868	it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears that it must
 29869	be so! But Iâwhat is to become of me?â thought he. He had the
 29870	unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and
 29871	believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the
 29872	evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part
 29873	in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and
 29874	deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and
 29875	falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he
 29876	had to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under
 29877	the burden of these insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to
 29878	any distraction in order to forget them. He frequented every kind of
 29879	society, drank much, bought pictures, engaged in building, and above
 29880	allâread.
 29881	
 29882	He read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home, while
 29883	his valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book and
 29884	began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping to
 29885	gossip in drawing rooms of the club, from gossip to carousals and women;
 29886	from carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking became more
 29887	and more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the doctors
 29888	warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him, he
 29889	drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having poured several
 29890	glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant
 29891	warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his fellows, and a
 29892	readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it
 29893	deeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the
 29894	terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was
 29895	not as dreadful as he had thought. He was always conscious of some
 29896	aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or
 29897	supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read. But under the
 29898	influence of wine he said to himself: âIt doesnât matter. Iâll
 29899	get it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but have no time nowâIâll
 29900	think it all out later on!â But the later on never came.
 29901	
 29902	In the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions appeared as
 29903	insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up a book, and
 29904	if anyone came to see him he was glad.
 29905	
 29906	Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
 29907	entrenched under the enemyâs fire, if they have nothing to do, try
 29908	hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To
 29909	Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life:
 29910	some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women,
 29911	some in toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some
 29912	in wine, and some in governmental affairs. âNothing is trivial, and
 29913	nothing is important, itâs all the sameâonly to save oneself from it
 29914	as best one can,â thought Pierre. âOnly not to see it, that dreadful
 29915	it!â
 29916	
 29917	
 29918	
 29919	
 29920	
 29921	CHAPTER II
 29922	
 29923	At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski and his daughter
 29924	moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alexanderâs
 29925	regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French tendency prevailed
 29926	there, and this, together with his past and his intellect and his
 29927	originality, at once made Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski an object of
 29928	particular respect to the Moscovites and the center of the Moscow
 29929	opposition to the government.
 29930	
 29931	The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of
 29932	senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent
 29933	events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which
 29934	he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of this
 29935	the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful
 29936	venerationâespecially of an evening when he came in to tea in his
 29937	old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone, told his
 29938	abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing
 29939	criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with
 29940	its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and
 29941	the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his
 29942	gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted
 29943	to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors
 29944	did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw
 29945	their host, there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the
 29946	private and intimate life of the house continued.
 29947	
 29948	Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.
 29949	There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasuresâtalks with
 29950	the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hillsâand
 29951	she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not
 29952	go out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her
 29953	go anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out
 29954	himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. She
 29955	had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She saw the coldness
 29956	and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
 29957	young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. She
 29958	had no friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in
 29959	the two who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom
 29960	she had never been able to be quite frank, had now become unpleasant to
 29961	her, and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom
 29962	she had corresponded for the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved
 29963	to be quite alien to her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the
 29964	death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow,
 29965	was in the full whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young
 29966	men who, she fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth.
 29967	Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels
 29968	that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be
 29969	decided now or never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a
 29970	mournful smile that she now had no one to write to, since Julieâwhose
 29971	presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the
 29972	old Ã©migrÃ© who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
 29973	evenings for years, she regretted Julieâs presence and having no one
 29974	to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one to
 29975	whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just then.
 29976	The time for Prince Andrewâs return and marriage was approaching, but
 29977	his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried
 29978	out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless, for at every
 29979	mention of the young Countess RostÃ³va the old prince (who apart from
 29980	that was usually in a bad temper) lost control of himself. Another
 29981	lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old
 29982	nephew. To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to
 29983	little Nicholas some symptoms of her fatherâs irritability. However
 29984	often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her
 29985	nephew, almost every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down to show
 29986	him the French alphabet, she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly
 29987	and easily into the childâwho was already afraid that Auntie might at
 29988	any moment get angryâthat at his slightest inattention she trembled,
 29989	became flustered and heated, raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him
 29990	by the arm and put him in the corner. Having put him in the corner
 29991	she would herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little
 29992	Nicholas, following her example, would sob, and without permission would
 29993	leave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and
 29994	comfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her
 29995	fatherâs irritability, which was always directed against her and had
 29996	of late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to
 29997	the ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water,
 29998	it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but
 29999	this loving despotâthe more cruel because he loved her and for that
 30000	reason tormented himself and herâknew how not merely to hurt and
 30001	humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame
 30002	for everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented
 30003	Princess Mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing
 30004	intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at the first moment
 30005	of receiving the news of his sonâs intentions had occurred to him in
 30006	jestâthat if Andrew got married he himself would marry Bourienneâhad
 30007	evidently pleased him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it
 30008	seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments
 30009	to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by
 30010	demonstrations of love of Bourienne.
 30011	
 30012	One day in Moscow in Princess Maryâs presence (she thought her father
 30013	did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle
 30014	Bourienneâs hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.
 30015	Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later
 30016	Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Maryâs room smiling and
 30017	making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily
 30018	wiped away her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne,
 30019	and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry
 30020	haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: âItâs horrible, vile,
 30021	inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...â She did not finish.
 30022	âLeave my room,â she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.
 30023	
 30024	Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed
 30025	that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be
 30026	served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from
 30027	habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious,
 30028	threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to have him
 30029	conscripted for the army.
 30030	
 30031	âHe doesnât obey... I said it twice... and he doesnât obey! She
 30032	is the first person in this house; sheâs my best friend,â cried
 30033	the prince. âAnd if you allow yourself,â he screamed in a fury,
 30034	addressing Princess Mary for the first time, âto forget yourself again
 30035	before her as you dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master
 30036	in this house. Go! Donât let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!â
 30037	
 30038	Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienneâs pardon, and also her
 30039	fatherâs pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged
 30040	for her intervention.
 30041	
 30042	At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
 30043	soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
 30044	spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or
 30045	would forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with
 30046	his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness,
 30047	or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him
 30048	would suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking
 30049	head sink over his plate. âHe is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn
 30050	him!â she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against
 30051	herself.

 30057	CHAPTER III
 30058	
 30059	In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctorâMÃ©tivierâwho had
 30060	rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable
 30061	as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily clever
 30062	doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but
 30063	as an equal.
 30064	
 30065	Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on
 30066	Mademoiselle Bourienneâs advice had allowed this doctor to visit him
 30067	and had grown accustomed to him. MÃ©tivier came to see the prince about
 30068	twice a week.
 30069	
 30070	On December 6âSt. Nicholasâ Day and the princeâs name dayâall
 30071	Moscow came to the princeâs front door but he gave orders to admit no
 30072	one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave
 30073	to Princess Mary.
 30074	
 30075	MÃ©tivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered
 30076	it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne, * as he told
 30077	Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on that
 30078	morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods. He had
 30079	been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone
 30080	and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be
 30081	understood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed
 30082	querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage, and she
 30083	went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun
 30084	and awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctorâs arrival the
 30085	morning had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor, Princess Mary
 30086	sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she
 30087	could hear all that passed in the study.
 30088	
 30089	    * To force the guard.
 30090	
 30091	At first she heard only MÃ©tivierâs voice, then her fatherâs, then
 30092	both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open,
 30093	and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified
 30094	MÃ©tivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing
 30095	gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes
 30096	rolled downwards.
 30097	
 30098	âYou donât understand?â shouted the prince, âbut I do! French
 30099	spy, slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell
 30100	you...â and he slammed the door.
 30101	
 30102	MÃ©tivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne
 30103	who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.
 30104	
 30105	âThe prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head. Keep
 30106	calm, I will call again tomorrow,â said MÃ©tivier; and putting his
 30107	fingers to his lips he hastened away.
 30108	
 30109	Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:
 30110	âSpies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a momentâs peace in my
 30111	own house!â
 30112	
 30113	After MÃ©tivierâs departure the old prince called his daughter in, and
 30114	the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy
 30115	had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list,
 30116	and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that
 30117	scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he
 30118	could not have a momentâs peace and could not die quietly.
 30119	
 30120	âNo, maâam! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand
 30121	it! I cannot endure any more,â he said, and left the room. Then, as if
 30122	afraid she might find some means of consolation, he returned and trying
 30123	to appear calm added: âAnd donât imagine I have said this in a
 30124	moment of anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and it will be
 30125	carried outâwe must part; so find some place for yourself....â But
 30126	he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one
 30127	who loves is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at
 30128	her and screamed:
 30129	
 30130	âIf only some fool would marry her!â Then he slammed the door, sent
 30131	for Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.
 30132	
 30133	At two oâclock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.
 30134	
 30135	These guestsâthe famous Count RostopchÃ­n, Prince LopukhÃ­n with his
 30136	nephew, General ChatrÃ³v an old war comrade of the princeâs, and
 30137	of the younger generation Pierre and BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³yâawaited the
 30138	prince in the drawing room.
 30139	
 30140	BorÃ­s, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been
 30141	anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski, and had contrived
 30142	to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an
 30143	exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.
 30144	
 30145	The princeâs house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
 30146	society, but his little circleâthough not much talked about in
 30147	townâwas one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.
 30148	BorÃ­s had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in
 30149	his presence invited RostopchÃ­n to dinner on St. Nicholasâ Day, and
 30150	RostopchÃ­n had replied that he could not come:
 30151	
 30152	âOn that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince
 30153	Nicholas BolkÃ³nski.â
 30154	
 30155	âOh, yes, yes!â replied the commander in chief. âHow is he?...â
 30156	
 30157	The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned
 30158	drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of
 30159	a court of justice. All were silent or talked in low tones. Prince
 30160	Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed even quieter
 30161	and more diffident than usual. The guests were reluctant to address
 30162	her, feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation. Count
 30163	RostopchÃ­n alone kept the conversation going, now relating the latest
 30164	town news, and now the latest political gossip.
 30165	
 30166	LopukhÃ­n and the old general occasionally took part in the
 30167	conversation. Prince BolkÃ³nski listened as a presiding judge receives a
 30168	report, only now and then, silently or by a brief word, showing that
 30169	he took heed of what was being reported to him. The tone of the
 30170	conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was
 30171	being done in the political world. Incidents were related evidently
 30172	confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse, but
 30173	whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped,
 30174	or was stopped, at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the
 30175	sovereign himself.
 30176	
 30177	At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleonâs
 30178	seizure of the Duke of Oldenburgâs territory, and the Russian Note,
 30179	hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.
 30180	
 30181	âBonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,â said
 30182	Count RostopchÃ­n, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times
 30183	before. âOne only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the
 30184	crowned heads. Now the Popeâs turn has come and Bonaparte doesnât
 30185	scruple to depose the head of the Catholic Churchâyet all keep silent!
 30186	Our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the Duke
 30187	of Oldenburgâs territory, and even...â Count RostopchÃ­n paused,
 30188	feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was
 30189	impossible.
 30190	
 30191	âOther territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of
 30192	Oldenburg,â said Prince BolkÃ³nski. âHe shifts the Dukes about as
 30193	I might move my serfs from Bald Hills to BoguchÃ¡rovo or my RyazÃ¡n
 30194	estates.â
 30195	
 30196	âThe Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable
 30197	strength of character and resignation,â remarked BorÃ­s, joining in
 30198	respectfully.
 30199	
 30200	He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor
 30201	of being presented to the Duke. Prince BolkÃ³nski glanced at the
 30202	young man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his mind,
 30203	evidently considering him too young.
 30204	
 30205	âI have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised
 30206	how badly the Note was worded,â remarked Count RostopchÃ­n in the
 30207	casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.
 30208	
 30209	Pierre looked at RostopchÃ­n with naÃ¯ve astonishment, not understanding
 30210	why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.
 30211	
 30212	âDoes it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,â he asked, âso
 30213	long as its substance is forcible?â
 30214	
 30215	âMy dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be
 30216	easy to have a good style,â returned Count RostopchÃ­n.
 30217	
 30218	Pierre now understood the countâs dissatisfaction with the wording of
 30219	the Note.
 30220	
 30221	âOne would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,â
 30222	remarked the old prince. âThere in Petersburg they are always
 30223	writingânot notes only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written
 30224	a whole volume of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!â
 30225	and he laughed unnaturally.
 30226	
 30227	There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared
 30228	his throat to draw attention.
 30229	
 30230	âDid you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The
 30231	figure cut by the new French ambassador.â
 30232	
 30233	âEh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His
 30234	Majestyâs presence.â
 30235	
 30236	âHis Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march
 30237	past,â continued the general, âand it seems the ambassador took
 30238	no notice and allowed himself to reply that: âWe in France pay no
 30239	attention to such trifles!â The Emperor did not condescend to reply.
 30240	At the next review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to address
 30241	him.â
 30242	
 30243	All were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was
 30244	impossible to pass any judgment.
 30245	
 30246	âImpudent fellows!â said the prince. âYou know MÃ©tivier? I turned
 30247	him out of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in
 30248	spite of my request that they should let no one in,â he went on,
 30249	glancing angrily at his daughter.
 30250	
 30251	And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and
 30252	the reasons that convinced him that MÃ©tivier was a spy. Though these
 30253	reasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.
 30254	
 30255	After the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate
 30256	the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.
 30257	
 30258	He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,
 30259	clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told
 30260	her that he had not forgotten the morningâs talk, that his decision
 30261	remained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his
 30262	speaking of it to her now.
 30263	
 30264	When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the old
 30265	men sat together.
 30266	
 30267	Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the
 30268	impending war.
 30269	
 30270	He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we
 30271	sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European
 30272	affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit. âWe
 30273	ought not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political
 30274	interests are all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing
 30275	is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will never dare
 30276	to cross the Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!â
 30277	
 30278	âHow can we fight the French, Prince?â said Count RostopchÃ­n.
 30279	âCan we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at
 30280	our youths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our
 30281	Kingdom of Heaven.â
 30282	
 30283	He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.
 30284	
 30285	âFrench dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned
 30286	MÃ©tivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and
 30287	a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to
 30288	a party last night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman
 30289	Catholics and had the Popeâs indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays.
 30290	And they themselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our
 30291	Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, when one looks at our young people,
 30292	Prince, one would like to take Peter the Greatâs old cudgel out of the
 30293	museum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps
 30294	out of them.â
 30295	
 30296	All were silent. The old prince looked at RostopchÃ­n with a smile and
 30297	wagged his head approvingly.
 30298	
 30299	âWell, good-by, your excellency, keep well!â said RostopchÃ­n,
 30300	getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the
 30301	prince.
 30302	
 30303	âGood-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of
 30304	hearing him!â said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and
 30305	offering his cheek to be kissed.
 30306	
 30307	Following RostopchÃ­nâs example the others also rose.
 30308	
 30309	
 30310	
 30311	
 30312	
 30313	CHAPTER IV
 30314	
 30315	Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old menâs talk and
 30316	faultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered
 30317	whether the guests had all observed her fatherâs hostile attitude
 30318	toward her. She did not even notice the special attentions and
 30319	amiabilities shown her during dinner by BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, who was
 30320	visiting them for the third time already.
 30321	
 30322	Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who
 30323	hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to
 30324	approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone
 30325	in the drawing room.
 30326	
 30327	âMay I stay a little longer?â he said, letting his stout body sink
 30328	into an armchair beside her.
 30329	
 30330	âOh yes,â she answered. âYou noticed nothing?â her look asked.
 30331	
 30332	Pierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight before
 30333	him and smiled quietly.
 30334	
 30335	âHave you known that young man long, Princess?â he asked.
 30336	
 30337	âWho?â
 30338	
 30339	âDrubetskÃ³y.â
 30340	
 30341	âNo, not long....â
 30342	
 30343	âDo you like him?â
 30344	
 30345	âYes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?â said
 30346	Princess Mary, still thinking of that morningâs conversation with her
 30347	father.
 30348	
 30349	âBecause I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from
 30350	Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
 30351	heiress.â
 30352	
 30353	âYou have observed that?â said Princess Mary.
 30354	
 30355	âYes,â returned Pierre with a smile, âand this young man now
 30356	manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is
 30357	too. I can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay
 30358	siege toâyou or Mademoiselle Julie KarÃ¡gina. He is very attentive to
 30359	her.â
 30360	
 30361	âHe visits them?â
 30362	
 30363	âYes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?â said
 30364	Pierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good
 30365	humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary.
 30366	
 30367	âNo,â replied Princess Mary.
 30368	
 30369	âTo please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is very
 30370	melancholy with Mademoiselle KarÃ¡gina,â said Pierre.
 30371	
 30372	âReally?â asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierreâs kindly
 30373	face and still thinking of her own sorrow. âIt would be a relief,â
 30374	thought she, âif I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone.
 30375	I should like to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It
 30376	would be a relief. He would give me advice.â
 30377	
 30378	âWould you marry him?â
 30379	
 30380	âOh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!â
 30381	she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice.
 30382	âAh, how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel
 30383	that...â she went on in a trembling voice, âthat you can do nothing
 30384	for him but grieve him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then
 30385	there is only one thing leftâto go away, but where could I go?â
 30386	
 30387	âWhat is wrong? What is it, Princess?â
 30388	
 30389	But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into
 30390	tears.
 30391	
 30392	âI donât know what is the matter with me today. Donât take any
 30393	noticeâforget what I have said!â
 30394	
 30395	Pierreâs gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the
 30396	princess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but
 30397	she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that
 30398	she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble
 30399	except the one he knew ofâthat Prince Andrewâs marriage threatened
 30400	to cause a rupture between father and son.
 30401	
 30402	âHave you any news of the RostÃ³vs?â she asked, to change the
 30403	subject. âI was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew
 30404	any day. I should like them to meet here.â
 30405	
 30406	âAnd how does he now regard the matter?â asked Pierre, referring to
 30407	the old prince.
 30408	
 30409	Princess Mary shook her head.
 30410	
 30411	âWhat is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The thing
 30412	is impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments.
 30413	I wish they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her. You have
 30414	known them a long time,â said Princess Mary. âTell me honestly
 30415	the whole truth: what sort of girl is she, and what do you think of
 30416	her?âThe real truth, because you know Andrew is risking so much doing
 30417	this against his fatherâs will that I should like to know....â
 30418	
 30419	An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and
 30420	repeated requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on
 30421	the princessâ part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that
 30422	he should disapprove of Andrewâs choice; but in reply he said what he
 30423	felt rather than what he thought.
 30424	
 30425	âI donât know how to answer your question,â he said, blushing
 30426	without knowing why. âI really donât know what sort of girl she is;
 30427	I canât analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I
 30428	donât know. That is all one can say about her.â
 30429	
 30430	Princess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: âYes,
 30431	thatâs what I expected and feared.â
 30432	
 30433	âIs she clever?â she asked.
 30434	
 30435	Pierre considered.
 30436	
 30437	âI think not,â he said, âand yetâyes. She does not deign to be
 30438	clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.â
 30439	
 30440	Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.
 30441	
 30442	âAh, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.â
 30443	
 30444	âI hear they are expected very soon,â said Pierre.
 30445	
 30446	Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
 30447	sister-in-law as soon as the RostÃ³vs arrived and to try to accustom the
 30448	old prince to her.

 30454	CHAPTER V
 30455	
 30456	BorÃ­s had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, so
 30457	with the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered between
 30458	the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though Princess
 30459	Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he,
 30460	without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her. When they
 30461	had last met on the old princeâs name day, she had answered at random
 30462	all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what
 30463	he was saying.
 30464	
 30465	Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a
 30466	manner peculiar to herself.
 30467	
 30468	She was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become
 30469	very wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself not
 30470	merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She
 30471	was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very
 30472	wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less
 30473	dangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could associate
 30474	with her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and the animated
 30475	company that assembled at her house, without incurring any obligation.
 30476	A man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day
 30477	to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of
 30478	compromising her and committing himself, would now go boldly every day
 30479	and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.
 30480	
 30481	That winter the KarÃ¡ginsâ house was the most agreeable and hospitable
 30482	in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large
 30483	company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight
 30484	and staying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a
 30485	promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion.
 30486	But in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and
 30487	told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love,
 30488	or any of the joys of life, and expected peace only âyonder.â She
 30489	adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment, like a
 30490	girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by
 30491	him. Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in
 30492	that light, and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered
 30493	much in life. This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing
 30494	herself, did not hinder the young people who came to her house from
 30495	passing the time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid
 30496	his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused
 30497	himself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts
 30498	rimÃ©s, which were in vogue at the KarÃ¡ginsâ. Only a few of these
 30499	young men, among them BorÃ­s, entered more deeply into Julieâs
 30500	melancholy, and with these she had prolonged conversations in private
 30501	on the vanity of all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums
 30502	filled with mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.
 30503	
 30504	To BorÃ­s, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early
 30505	disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of friendship
 30506	as she who had herself suffered so much could render, and showed him
 30507	her album. BorÃ­s sketched two trees in the album and wrote: âRustic
 30508	trees, your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.â
 30509	
 30510	On another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:
 30511	
 30512	    La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.
 30513	    Ah! contre les douleurs il nây a pas dâautre asile. *
 30514	
 30515	    * Death gives relief and death is peaceful.
 30516	      Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.
 30517	
 30518	Julie said this was charming
 30519	
 30520	âThere is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,â she
 30521	said to BorÃ­s, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a
 30522	book. âIt is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness
 30523	and despair, showing the possibility of consolation.â
 30524	
 30525	In reply BorÃ­s wrote these lines:
 30526	
 30527	    Aliment de poison dâune Ã¢me trop sensible,
 30528	    Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,
 30529	    Tendre mÃ©lancholie, ah, viens me consoler,
 30530	    Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,
 30531	    Et mÃªle une douceur secrÃ¨te
 30532	    A ces pleurs que je sens couler. *
 30533	
 30534	      *Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,
 30535	     Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,
 30536	     Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,
 30537	     Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,
 30538	     And mingle a secret sweetness
 30539	     With these tears that I feel to be flowing.
 30540	
 30541	For BorÃ­s, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. BorÃ­s
 30542	read Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the reading
 30543	because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large gatherings
 30544	Julie and BorÃ­s looked on one another as the only souls who understood
 30545	one another in a world of indifferent people.
 30546	
 30547	Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, who often visited the KarÃ¡gins, while playing cards
 30548	with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julieâs dowry (she was
 30549	to have two estates in PÃ©nza and the NizhegÃ³rod forests). Anna
 30550	MikhÃ¡ylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the
 30551	wealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.
 30552	
 30553	âYou are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,â she said to
 30554	the daughter. âBorÃ­s says his soul finds repose at your house. He has
 30555	suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,â said she to
 30556	the mother. âAh, my dear, I canât tell you how fond I have grown
 30557	of Julie latterly,â she said to her son. âBut who could help loving
 30558	her? She is an angelic being! Ah, BorÃ­s, BorÃ­s!ââshe paused.
 30559	âAnd how I pity her mother,â she went on; âtoday she showed me her
 30560	accounts and letters from PÃ©nza (they have enormous estates there), and
 30561	she, poor thing, has no one to help her, and they do cheat her so!â
 30562	
 30563	BorÃ­s smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. He
 30564	laughed blandly at her naÃ¯ve diplomacy but listened to what she had
 30565	to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the PÃ©nza and
 30566	NizhegÃ³rod estates.
 30567	
 30568	Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and
 30569	was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion for her,
 30570	for her passionate desire to get married, for her artificiality, and
 30571	a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still
 30572	restrained BorÃ­s. His leave was expiring. He spent every day and whole
 30573	days at the KarÃ¡ginsâ, and every day on thinking the matter over
 30574	told himself that he would propose tomorrow. But in Julieâs presence,
 30575	looking at her red face and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist
 30576	eyes, and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from
 30577	melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss, BorÃ­s could not
 30578	utter the decisive words, though in imagination he had long regarded
 30579	himself as the possessor of those PÃ©nza and NizhegÃ³rod estates and
 30580	had apportioned the use of the income from them. Julie saw BorÃ­sâ
 30581	indecision, and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was
 30582	repulsive to him, but her feminine self-deception immediately supplied
 30583	her with consolation, and she told herself that he was only shy from
 30584	love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to irritability, and not
 30585	long before BorÃ­sâ departure she formed a definite plan of action.
 30586	Just as BorÃ­sâ leave of absence was expiring, Anatole KurÃ¡gin made
 30587	his appearance in Moscow, and of course in the KarÃ¡ginsâ drawing
 30588	room, and Julie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and
 30589	very attentive to KurÃ¡gin.
 30590	
 30591	âMy dear,â said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna to her son, âI know from a
 30592	reliable source that Prince VasÃ­li has sent his son to Moscow to get
 30593	him married to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for
 30594	her. What do you think of it, my dear?â
 30595	
 30596	The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole
 30597	month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all
 30598	the revenue from the PÃ©nza estates which he had already mentally
 30599	apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another, and
 30600	especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained BorÃ­s. He drove
 30601	to the KarÃ¡ginsâ with the firm intention of proposing. Julie met
 30602	him in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of how she had enjoyed
 30603	yesterdayâs ball, and asked when he was leaving. Though BorÃ­s had
 30604	come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be
 30605	tender, he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy, of how
 30606	easily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how their moods depend
 30607	solely on who happens to be paying court to them. Julie was offended and
 30608	replied that it was true that a woman needs variety, and the same thing
 30609	over and over again would weary anyone.
 30610	
 30611	âThen I should advise you...â BorÃ­s began, wishing to sting her;
 30612	but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might
 30613	have to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have
 30614	vainly wasted his effortsâwhich was a thing he never allowed to
 30615	happen.
 30616	
 30617	He checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to
 30618	avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:
 30619	
 30620	âI did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...â
 30621	
 30622	He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability had
 30623	suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were fixed on
 30624	him with greedy expectation. âI can always arrange so as not to see
 30625	her often,â thought BorÃ­s. âThe affair has been begun and must be
 30626	finished!â He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and said:
 30627	
 30628	âYou know my feelings for you!â
 30629	
 30630	There was no need to say more: Julieâs face shone with triumph and
 30631	self-satisfaction; but she forced BorÃ­s to say all that is said on such
 30632	occasionsâthat he loved her and had never loved any other woman more
 30633	than her. She knew that for the PÃ©nza estates and NizhegÃ³rod forests
 30634	she could demand this, and she received what she demanded.
 30635	
 30636	The affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and
 30637	melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house in
 30638	Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding.
 30639	
 30640	
 30641	
 30642	
 30643	
 30644	CHAPTER VI
 30645	
 30646	At the end of January old Count RostÃ³v went to Moscow with NatÃ¡sha and
 30647	SÃ³nya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was
 30648	impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in
 30649	Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
 30650	Moscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his
 30651	future daughter-in-law to old Prince BolkÃ³nski while he was in Moscow
 30652	could not be missed. The RostÃ³vsâ Moscow house had not been heated
 30653	that winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the countess
 30654	was not with them, the count decided to stay with MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
 30655	AkhrosÃ­mova, who had long been pressing her hospitality on them.
 30656	
 30657	Late one evening the RostÃ³vsâ four sleighs drove into MÃ¡rya
 30658	DmÃ­trievnaâs courtyard in the old KonyÃºsheny street. MÃ¡rya
 30659	DmÃ­trievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter, and
 30660	her sons were all in the service.
 30661	
 30662	She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,
 30663	loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach
 30664	to others for any weakness, passion, or temptationâthe possibility of
 30665	which she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing
 30666	jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:
 30667	on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on
 30668	affairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after
 30669	dressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there
 30670	were always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal
 30671	at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she played
 30672	a game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read
 30673	to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception and went out to
 30674	pay visits, and then only to the most important persons in the town.
 30675	
 30676	She had not yet gone to bed when the RostÃ³vs arrived and the pulley of
 30677	the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the RostÃ³vs and their
 30678	servants. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, with her spectacles hanging down on her
 30679	nose and her head flung back, stood in the hall doorway looking with
 30680	a stern, grim face at the new arrivals. One might have thought she was
 30681	angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out, had she
 30682	not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants
 30683	for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings.
 30684	
 30685	âThe countâs things? Bring them here,â she said, pointing to the
 30686	portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. âThe young ladiesâ? There
 30687	to the left. Now what are you dawdling for?â she cried to the maids.
 30688	âGet the samovar ready!... Youâve grown plumper and prettier,â she
 30689	remarked, drawing NatÃ¡sha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold)
 30690	to her by the hood. âFoo! You are cold! Now take off your things,
 30691	quick!â she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand.
 30692	âYouâre half frozen, Iâm sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour,
 30693	SÃ³nya dear!â she added, turning to SÃ³nya and indicating by this
 30694	French greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude
 30695	toward her.
 30696	
 30697	When they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and
 30698	tidied themselves up after their journey, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna kissed them
 30699	all in due order.
 30700	
 30701	âIâm heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was
 30702	high time,â she said, giving NatÃ¡sha a significant look. âThe old
 30703	man is here and his sonâs expected any day. Youâll have to make his
 30704	acquaintance. But weâll speak of that later on,â she added, glancing
 30705	at SÃ³nya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her
 30706	presence. âNow listen,â she said to the count. âWhat do you want
 30707	tomorrow? Whom will you send for? ShinshÃ­n?â she crooked one of her
 30708	fingers. âThe sniveling Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna? Thatâs two. Sheâs here
 30709	with her son. The son is getting married! Then BezÃºkhov, eh? He is here
 30710	too, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping after
 30711	him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for themââand she pointed to
 30712	the girlsââtomorrow Iâll take them first to the Iberian shrine
 30713	of the Mother of God, and then weâll drive to the Super-Rogueâs.
 30714	I suppose youâll have everything new. Donât judge by me: sleeves
 30715	nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess IrÃ­na VasÃ­levna
 30716	came to see me; she was an awful sightâlooked as if she had put two
 30717	barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without some new
 30718	fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?â she asked the count
 30719	sternly.
 30720	
 30721	âOne thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a
 30722	purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If you
 30723	will be so kind, Iâll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
 30724	day, and leave my lassies with you.â
 30725	
 30726	âAll right. All right. Theyâll be safe with me, as safe as in
 30727	Chancery! Iâll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and
 30728	pet them a bit,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, touching her goddaughter and
 30729	favorite, NatÃ¡sha, on the cheek with her large hand.
 30730	
 30731	Next morning MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna took the young ladies to the Iberian
 30732	shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so
 30733	afraid of MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna that she always let her have costumes at
 30734	a loss merely to get rid of her. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna ordered almost the
 30735	whole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the room
 30736	except NatÃ¡sha, and then called her pet to her armchair.
 30737	
 30738	âWell, now weâll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed.
 30739	Youâve hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and Iâve known
 30740	him since he was so high.â She held her hand a couple of feet from the
 30741	ground. NatÃ¡sha blushed happily. âI like him and all his family.
 30742	Now listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his sonâs
 30743	marrying. The old fellowâs crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not
 30744	a child and can shift without him, but itâs not nice to enter a family
 30745	against a fatherâs will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.
 30746	Youâre a clever girl and youâll know how to manage. Be kind, and use
 30747	your wits. Then all will be well.â
 30748	
 30749	NatÃ¡sha remained silent, from shyness MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna supposed, but
 30750	really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love
 30751	of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs
 30752	that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he
 30753	loved her only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She
 30754	wanted nothing more.
 30755	
 30756	âYou see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your
 30757	future sister-in-law. âHusbandsâ sisters bring up blisters,â
 30758	but this one wouldnât hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two
 30759	together. Tomorrow youâll go with your father to see her. Be very
 30760	nice and affectionate to her: youâre younger than she. When he comes,
 30761	heâll find you already know his sister and father and are liked by
 30762	them. Am I right or not? Wonât that be best?â
 30763	
 30764	âYes, it will,â NatÃ¡sha answered reluctantly.
 30765	
 30766	
 30767	
 30768	
 30769	
 30770	CHAPTER VII
 30771	
 30772	Next day, by MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs advice, Count RostÃ³v took NatÃ¡sha
 30773	to call on Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski. The count did not set out
 30774	cheerfully on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well remembered
 30775	the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the
 30776	enrollment, when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to
 30777	listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of
 30778	men. NatÃ¡sha, on the other hand, having put on her best gown, was in
 30779	the highest spirits. âThey canât help liking me,â she thought.
 30780	âEverybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to do anything
 30781	they wish, so ready to be fond of himâfor being his fatherâand of
 30782	herâfor being his sisterâthat there is no reason for them not to
 30783	like me....â
 30784	
 30785	They drove up to the gloomy old house on the VozdvÃ­zhenka and entered
 30786	the vestibule.
 30787	
 30788	âWell, the Lord have mercy on us!â said the count, half in jest,
 30789	half in earnest; but NatÃ¡sha noticed that her father was flurried on
 30790	entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince
 30791	and princess were at home.
 30792	
 30793	When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
 30794	servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
 30795	another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a
 30796	maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning
 30797	the princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced
 30798	to the RostÃ³vs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess
 30799	begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors
 30800	was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter
 30801	with special politeness and showed them to the princessâ room. The
 30802	princess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran
 30803	in to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear
 30804	cordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess Mary did not like
 30805	NatÃ¡sha. She thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and
 30806	vain. She did not at all realize that before having seen her future
 30807	sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her
 30808	beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by jealousy of her brotherâs
 30809	love for her. Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess
 30810	Mary was agitated just then because on the RostÃ³vsâ being announced,
 30811	the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them, that
 30812	Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but they were not to be admitted
 30813	to him. She had decided to receive them, but feared lest the prince
 30814	might at any moment indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by
 30815	the RostÃ³vsâ visit.
 30816	
 30817	âThere, my dear princess, Iâve brought you my songstress,â said
 30818	the count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince
 30819	might appear. âI am so glad you should get to know one another... very
 30820	sorry the prince is still ailing,â and after a few more commonplace
 30821	remarks he rose. âIf youâll allow me to leave my NatÃ¡sha in your
 30822	hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, Iâll drive round to see Anna
 30823	SemÃ«novna, itâs quite near in the Dogsâ Square, and then Iâll
 30824	come back for her.â
 30825	
 30826	The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his
 30827	daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk
 30828	to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of
 30829	encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention
 30830	this to his daughter, but NatÃ¡sha noticed her fatherâs nervousness
 30831	and anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still
 30832	angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and
 30833	defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The
 30834	princess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him
 30835	to stay longer at Anna SemÃ«novnaâs, and he departed.
 30836	
 30837	Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Maryâwho wished
 30838	to have a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with NatÃ¡shaâMademoiselle Bourienne
 30839	remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and
 30840	theaters. NatÃ¡sha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in
 30841	the anteroom, by her fatherâs nervousness, and by the unnatural manner
 30842	of the princess whoâshe thoughtâwas making a favor of receiving her,
 30843	and so everything displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom
 30844	she thought very plain, affected, and dry. NatÃ¡sha suddenly shrank
 30845	into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated
 30846	Princess Mary still more. After five minutes of irksome, constrained
 30847	conversation, they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly
 30848	approaching. Princess Mary looked frightened.
 30849	
 30850	The door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white
 30851	nightcap, came in.
 30852	
 30853	âAh, madam!â he began. âMadam, Countess... Countess RostÃ³va, if
 30854	I am not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not
 30855	know, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with
 30856	a visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg you
 30857	to excuse me... God is my witness, I didnât knowââ he repeated,
 30858	stressing the word âGodâ so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
 30859	Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
 30860	father or at NatÃ¡sha.
 30861	
 30862	Nor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.
 30863	Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.
 30864	
 30865	âI beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not
 30866	know,â muttered the old man, and after looking NatÃ¡sha over from head
 30867	to foot he went out.
 30868	
 30869	Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
 30870	apparition and began speaking about the princeâs indisposition.
 30871	NatÃ¡sha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the
 30872	longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater
 30873	grew their antipathy to one another.
 30874	
 30875	When the count returned, NatÃ¡sha was impolitely pleased and hastened
 30876	to get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who
 30877	could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
 30878	hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. âI couldnât
 30879	begin talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman,â thought
 30880	NatÃ¡sha. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She
 30881	knew what she ought to have said to NatÃ¡sha, but she had been unable
 30882	to say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because,
 30883	without knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of the
 30884	marriage. When the count was already leaving the room, Princess Mary
 30885	went up hurriedly to NatÃ¡sha, took her by the hand, and said with a
 30886	deep sigh:
 30887	
 30888	âWait, I must...â
 30889	
 30890	NatÃ¡sha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.
 30891	
 30892	âDear Natalie,â said Princess Mary, âI want you to know that I am
 30893	glad my brother has found happiness....â
 30894	
 30895	She paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. NatÃ¡sha noticed
 30896	this and guessed its reason.
 30897	
 30898	âI think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,â
 30899	she said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears
 30900	choking her.
 30901	
 30902	âWhat have I said and what have I done?â thought she, as soon as she
 30903	was out of the room.
 30904	
 30905	They waited a long time for NatÃ¡sha to come to dinner that day. She sat
 30906	in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. SÃ³nya
 30907	stood beside her, kissing her hair.
 30908	
 30909	âNatÃ¡sha, what is it about?â she asked. âWhat do they matter to
 30910	you? It will all pass, NatÃ¡sha.â
 30911	
 30912	âBut if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...â
 30913	
 30914	âDonât talk about it, NatÃ¡sha. It wasnât your fault so why should
 30915	you mind? Kiss me,â said SÃ³nya.
 30916	
 30917	NatÃ¡sha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed
 30918	her wet face against her.
 30919	
 30920	âI canât tell you, I donât know. No oneâs to blame,â said
 30921	NatÃ¡shaââItâs my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why
 30922	doesnât he come?...â
 30923	
 30924	She came in to dinner with red eyes. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, who knew how
 30925	the prince had received the RostÃ³vs, pretended not to notice how upset
 30926	NatÃ¡sha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count
 30927	and the other guests.
 30928	
 30929	
 30930	
 30931	
 30932	
 30933	CHAPTER VIII
 30934	
 30935	That evening the RostÃ³vs went to the Opera, for which MÃ¡rya
 30936	DmÃ­trievna had taken a box.
 30937	
 30938	NatÃ¡sha did not want to go, but could not refuse MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs
 30939	kind offer which was intended expressly for her. When she came ready
 30940	dressed into the ballroom to await her father, and looking in the large
 30941	mirror there saw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt even more
 30942	sad, but it was a sweet, tender sadness.
 30943	
 30944	âO God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but
 30945	differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply
 30946	embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching
 30947	inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I
 30948	would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyesâhow I see those
 30949	eyes!â thought NatÃ¡sha. âAnd what do his father and sister matter
 30950	to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with
 30951	his smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not think of
 30952	him; not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present.
 30953	I canât bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!â and she
 30954	turned away from the glass, making an effort not to cry. âAnd how
 30955	can SÃ³nya love Nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so
 30956	patiently?â thought she, looking at SÃ³nya, who also came in quite
 30957	ready, with a fan in her hand. âNo, sheâs altogether different. I
 30958	canât!â
 30959	
 30960	NatÃ¡sha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
 30961	enough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at
 30962	once, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of
 30963	love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside her
 30964	father, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on
 30965	the frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in love, and forgot
 30966	where she was going and with whom. Having fallen into the line of
 30967	carriages, the RostÃ³vsâ carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels
 30968	squeaking over the snow. NatÃ¡sha and SÃ³nya, holding up their dresses,
 30969	jumped out quickly. The count got out helped by the footmen, and,
 30970	passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers,
 30971	they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes.
 30972	Through the closed doors the music was already audible.
 30973	
 30974	âNatÃ¡sha, your hair!...â whispered SÃ³nya.
 30975	
 30976	An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
 30977	opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the
 30978	door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
 30979	shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before
 30980	their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy
 30981	at NatÃ¡sha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being
 30982	played. NatÃ¡sha, smoothing her gown, went in with SÃ³nya and sat down,
 30983	scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not
 30984	experienced for a long timeâthat of hundreds of eyes looking at
 30985	her bare arms and neckâsuddenly affected her both agreeably and
 30986	disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and
 30987	emotions associated with that feeling.
 30988	
 30989	The two remarkably pretty girls, NatÃ¡sha and SÃ³nya, with Count RostÃ³v
 30990	who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general
 30991	attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of NatÃ¡shaâs engagement
 30992	to Prince Andrew, and knew that the RostÃ³vs had lived in the country
 30993	ever since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancÃ©e who was making
 30994	one of the best matches in Russia.
 30995	
 30996	NatÃ¡shaâs looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country,
 30997	and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty.
 30998	She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty,
 30999	combined with her indifference to everything about her. Her black eyes
 31000	looked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare
 31001	to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently
 31002	unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music,
 31003	crumpling her program. âLook, thereâs AlÃ©nina,â said SÃ³nya,
 31004	âwith her mother, isnât it?â
 31005	
 31006	âDear me, Michael KirÃ­lovich has grown still stouter!â remarked the
 31007	count.
 31008	
 31009	âLook at our Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâwhat a headdress she has on!â
 31010	
 31011	âThe KarÃ¡gins, Julieâand BorÃ­s with them. One can see at once that
 31012	theyâre engaged....â
 31013	
 31014	âDrubetskÃ³y has proposed?â
 31015	
 31016	âOh yes, I heard it today,â said ShinshÃ­n, coming into the
 31017	RostÃ³vsâ box.
 31018	
 31019	NatÃ¡sha looked in the direction in which her fatherâs eyes were
 31020	turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her
 31021	face and a string of pearls round her thick red neckâwhich NatÃ¡sha
 31022	knew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning
 31023	over with an ear to Julieâs mouth, was BorÃ­sâ handsome smoothly
 31024	brushed head. He looked at the RostÃ³vs from under his brows and said
 31025	something, smiling, to his betrothed.
 31026	
 31027	âThey are talking about us, about me and him!â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 31028	âAnd he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They neednât trouble
 31029	themselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of
 31030	them.â
 31031	
 31032	Behind them sat Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna wearing a green headdress and with a
 31033	happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their box was
 31034	pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which NatÃ¡sha knew
 31035	so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly remembered all
 31036	that had been so humiliating in her morningâs visit.
 31037	
 31038	âWhat right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh,
 31039	better not think of itânot till he comes back!â she told herself,
 31040	and began looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in
 31041	the stalls. In the front, in the very center, leaning back against
 31042	the orchestra rail, stood DÃ³lokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair
 31043	brushed up into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience,
 31044	well aware that he was attracting everyoneâs attention, yet as much at
 31045	ease as though he were in his own room. Around him thronged Moscowâs
 31046	most brilliant young men, whom he evidently dominated.
 31047	
 31048	The count, laughing, nudged the blushing SÃ³nya and pointed to her
 31049	former adorer.
 31050	
 31051	âDo you recognize him?â said he. âAnd where has he sprung from?â
 31052	he asked, turning to ShinshÃ­n. âDidnât he vanish somewhere?â
 31053	
 31054	âHe did,â replied ShinshÃ­n. âHe was in the Caucasus and ran
 31055	away from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling
 31056	prince in Persia, where he killed the Shahâs brother. Now all the
 31057	Moscow ladies are mad about him! Itâs âDÃ³lokhov the Persianâ that
 31058	does it! We never hear a word but DÃ³lokhov is mentioned. They swear
 31059	by him, they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet.
 31060	DÃ³lokhov and Anatole KurÃ¡gin have turned all our ladiesâ heads.â
 31061	
 31062	A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed
 31063	plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of
 31064	large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress
 31065	and took a long time settling into her place.
 31066	
 31067	NatÃ¡sha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and pearls
 31068	and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls.
 31069	While NatÃ¡sha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady
 31070	looked round and, meeting the countâs eyes, nodded to him and smiled.
 31071	She was the Countess BezÃºkhova, Pierreâs wife, and the count, who
 31072	knew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.
 31073	
 31074	âHave you been here long, Countess?â he inquired. âIâll call,
 31075	Iâll call to kiss your hand. Iâm here on business and have brought
 31076	my girls with me. They say SemÃ«nova acts marvelously. Count Pierre
 31077	never used to forget us. Is he here?â
 31078	
 31079	âYes, he meant to look in,â answered HÃ©lÃ¨ne, and glanced
 31080	attentively at NatÃ¡sha.
 31081	
 31082	Count RostÃ³v resumed his seat.
 31083	
 31084	âHandsome, isnât she?â he whispered to NatÃ¡sha.
 31085	
 31086	âWonderful!â answered NatÃ¡sha. âSheâs a woman one could easily
 31087	fall in love with.â
 31088	
 31089	Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor
 31090	tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls,
 31091	and the curtain rose.
 31092	
 31093	As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent, and
 31094	all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and all the
 31095	women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention with
 31096	eager curiosity to the stage. NatÃ¡sha too began to look at it.
 31097	
 31098	
 31099	
 31100	
 31101	
 31102	CHAPTER IX
 31103	
 31104	The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was
 31105	some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth
 31106	stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls in red
 31107	bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat
 31108	apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard
 31109	was glued. They all sang something. When they had finished their song
 31110	the girl in white went up to the prompterâs box and a man with tight
 31111	silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger,
 31112	went up to her and began singing, waving his arms about.
 31113	
 31114	First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they
 31115	both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand
 31116	of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with
 31117	her. They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping
 31118	and shouting, while the man and woman on the stageâwho represented
 31119	loversâbegan smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.
 31120	
 31121	After her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this
 31122	seemed grotesque and amazing to NatÃ¡sha. She could not follow the opera
 31123	nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the
 31124	queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in
 31125	that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but
 31126	it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
 31127	for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the
 31128	audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she
 31129	herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
 31130	on the stage, and expressed delight which to NatÃ¡sha seemed feigned.
 31131	âI suppose it has to be like this!â she thought. She kept looking
 31132	round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at
 31133	the seminude women in the boxes, especially at HÃ©lÃ¨ne in the next box,
 31134	whoâapparently quite unclothedâsat with a quiet tranquil smile, not
 31135	taking her eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded
 31136	the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, NatÃ¡sha little
 31137	by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not
 31138	experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she
 31139	was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the
 31140	strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her
 31141	mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and
 31142	singing the aria the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with
 31143	her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to
 31144	HÃ©lÃ¨ne and tickle her.
 31145	
 31146	At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a door
 31147	leading to the stalls on the side nearest the RostÃ³vsâ box creaked,
 31148	and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. âThereâs KurÃ¡gin!â
 31149	whispered ShinshÃ­n. Countess BezÃºkhova turned smiling to the newcomer,
 31150	and NatÃ¡sha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally
 31151	handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet
 31152	courteous bearing. This was Anatole KurÃ¡gin whom she had seen
 31153	and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an
 31154	adjutantâs uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with
 31155	a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been
 31156	so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression
 31157	of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was
 31158	proceeding, he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword
 31159	and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high.
 31160	Having looked at NatÃ¡sha he approached his sister, laid his well gloved
 31161	hand on the edge of her box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a
 31162	question, with a motion toward NatÃ¡sha.
 31163	
 31164	âMais charmante!â said he, evidently referring to NatÃ¡sha, who did
 31165	not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his
 31166	lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down
 31167	beside DÃ³lokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way
 31168	that DÃ³lokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily,
 31169	smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.
 31170	
 31171	âHow like the brother is to the sister,â remarked the count. âAnd
 31172	how handsome they both are!â
 31173	
 31174	ShinshÃ­n, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue
 31175	of KurÃ¡ginâs in Moscow, and NatÃ¡sha tried to overhear it just
 31176	because he had said she was âcharmante.â
 31177	
 31178	The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about, going
 31179	out and coming in.
 31180	
 31181	BorÃ­s came to the RostÃ³vsâ box, received their congratulations very
 31182	simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to
 31183	NatÃ¡sha and SÃ³nya his fiancÃ©eâs invitation to her wedding, and
 31184	went away. NatÃ¡sha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and
 31185	congratulated on his approaching wedding that same BorÃ­s with whom
 31186	she had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,
 31187	everything seemed simple and natural.
 31188	
 31189	The scantily clad HÃ©lÃ¨ne smiled at everyone in the same way, and
 31190	NatÃ¡sha gave BorÃ­s a similar smile.
 31191	
 31192	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
 31193	distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another
 31194	in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.
 31195	
 31196	During the whole of that entrâacte KurÃ¡gin stood with DÃ³lokhov
 31197	in front of the orchestra partition, looking at the RostÃ³vsâ box.
 31198	NatÃ¡sha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure.
 31199	She even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought
 31200	was its most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act
 31201	Pierre appeared in the stalls. The RostÃ³vs had not seen him since
 31202	their arrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since
 31203	NatÃ¡sha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing
 31204	anyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at and
 31205	indicating the RostÃ³vsâ box. On seeing NatÃ¡sha Pierre grew animated
 31206	and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box. When he
 31207	got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long
 31208	time. While conversing with Pierre, NatÃ¡sha heard a manâs voice in
 31209	Countess BezÃºkhovaâs box and something told her it was KurÃ¡gin. She
 31210	turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her
 31211	eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be
 31212	so near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he admired her, and
 31213	not to be acquainted with him.
 31214	
 31215	In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a
 31216	round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over
 31217	the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many
 31218	people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding
 31219	things like daggers in their hands. They began waving their arms. Then
 31220	some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been
 31221	in white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once,
 31222	but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and
 31223	behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and
 31224	everyone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly
 31225	interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.
 31226	
 31227	During this act every time NatÃ¡sha looked toward the stalls she saw
 31228	Anatole KurÃ¡gin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,
 31229	staring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and
 31230	it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.
 31231	
 31232	When the second act was over Countess BezÃºkhova rose, turned to the
 31233	RostÃ³vsâ boxâher whole bosom completely exposedâbeckoned the old
 31234	count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had
 31235	entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.
 31236	
 31237	âDo make me acquainted with your charming daughters,â said she.
 31238	âThe whole town is singing their praises and I donât even know
 31239	them!â
 31240	
 31241	NatÃ¡sha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so pleased
 31242	by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.
 31243	
 31244	âI want to become a Moscovite too, now,â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âHow is it
 31245	youâre not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?â
 31246	
 31247	Countess BezÃºkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating
 31248	woman. She could say what she did not thinkâespecially what was
 31249	flatteringâquite simply and naturally.
 31250	
 31251	âDear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I am
 31252	not staying here long this timeânor are youâI will try to amuse
 31253	them. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get
 31254	to know you,â said she to NatÃ¡sha with her stereotyped and lovely
 31255	smile. âI had heard about you from my page, DrubetskÃ³y. Have you
 31256	heard he is getting married? And also from my husbandâs friend
 31257	BolkÃ³nski, Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski,â she went on with special
 31258	emphasis, implying that she knew of his relation to NatÃ¡sha. To get
 31259	better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come
 31260	into her box for the rest of the performance, and NatÃ¡sha moved over to
 31261	it.
 31262	
 31263	The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
 31264	were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
 31265	walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The
 31266	king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly
 31267	and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white
 31268	and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the
 31269	throne with her hair down. She sang something mournfully, addressing the
 31270	queen, but the king waved his arm severely, and men and women with bare
 31271	legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together. Then the
 31272	violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick
 31273	bare legs and thin arms, separating from the others, went behind the
 31274	wings, adjusted her bodice, returned to the middle of the stage, and
 31275	began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other. In the
 31276	stalls everyone clapped and shouted âbravo!â Then one of the men
 31277	went into a corner of the stage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra
 31278	struck up more loudly, and this man with bare legs jumped very high and
 31279	waved his feet about very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty
 31280	thousand rubles a year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes,
 31281	and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the
 31282	man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men
 31283	and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the
 31284	sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm
 31285	came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
 31286	orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away,
 31287	and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise and
 31288	clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began
 31289	shouting: âDuport! Duport! Duport!â NatÃ¡sha no longer thought this
 31290	strange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.
 31291	
 31292	âIsnât Duport delightful?â HÃ©lÃ¨ne asked her.
 31293	
 31294	âOh, yes,â replied NatÃ¡sha.
 31295	
 31296	
 31297	
 31298	
 31299	
 31300	CHAPTER X
 31301	
 31302	During the entrâacte a whiff of cold air came into HÃ©lÃ¨neâs box,
 31303	the door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush
 31304	against anyone.
 31305	
 31306	âLet me introduce my brother to you,â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne, her eyes
 31307	shifting uneasily from NatÃ¡sha to Anatole.
 31308	
 31309	NatÃ¡sha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer
 31310	and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as handsome
 31311	at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he
 31312	had long wished to have this happinessâever since the NarÃ½shkinsâ
 31313	ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing
 31314	her. KurÃ¡gin was much more sensible and simple with women than among
 31315	men. He talked boldly and naturally, and NatÃ¡sha was strangely and
 31316	agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this
 31317	man about whom there was so much talk, but that on the contrary his
 31318	smile was most naÃ¯ve, cheerful, and good-natured.
 31319	
 31320	KurÃ¡gin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
 31321	previous performance SemÃ«nova had fallen down on the stage.
 31322	
 31323	âAnd do you know, Countess,â he said, suddenly addressing her as an
 31324	old, familiar acquaintance, âwe are getting up a costume tournament;
 31325	you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at
 31326	the KarÃ¡ginsâ! Please come! No! Really, eh?â said he.
 31327	
 31328	While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face,
 31329	her neck, and her bare arms. NatÃ¡sha knew for certain that he was
 31330	enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel
 31331	constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that
 31332	he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye
 31333	so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking into his
 31334	eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of
 31335	modesty she had always felt between herself and other men. She did not
 31336	know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself
 31337	terribly near to this man. When she turned away she feared he might
 31338	seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck. They
 31339	spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that they were closer to
 31340	one another than she had ever been to any man. NatÃ¡sha kept turning to
 31341	HÃ©lÃ¨ne and to her father, as if asking what it all meant, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne
 31342	was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her
 31343	look, and her fatherâs eyes said nothing but what they always said:
 31344	âHaving a good time? Well, Iâm glad of it!â
 31345	
 31346	During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatoleâs
 31347	prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, NatÃ¡sha, to break
 31348	the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the question and
 31349	blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing
 31350	something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.
 31351	
 31352	âAt first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant
 31353	ce sont les jolies femmes, * isnât that so? But now I like it very
 31354	much indeed,â he said, looking at her significantly. âYouâll come
 31355	to the costume tournament, Countess? Do come!â and putting out his
 31356	hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, âYou will be the
 31357	prettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a
 31358	pledge!â
 31359	
 31360	    * Are the pretty women.
 31361	
 31362	NatÃ¡sha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
 31363	himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
 31364	intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
 31365	not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that
 31366	he was there, behind, so close behind her.
 31367	
 31368	âHow is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?â she
 31369	asked herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked
 31370	straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the
 31371	good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just
 31372	as he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt with
 31373	horror that no barrier lay between him and her.
 31374	
 31375	The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay. NatÃ¡sha
 31376	went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive to the
 31377	world she found herself in. All that was going on before her now seemed
 31378	quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her
 31379	betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country did not once
 31380	recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past.
 31381	
 31382	In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm
 31383	about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared
 31384	down below. That was the only part of the fourth act that NatÃ¡sha saw.
 31385	She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was KurÃ¡gin whom
 31386	she could not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole
 31387	came up to them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was
 31388	putting NatÃ¡sha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and
 31389	flushed she turned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes,
 31390	smiling tenderly.
 31391	
 31392	
 31393	Only after she had reached home was NatÃ¡sha able clearly to think over
 31394	what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she
 31395	was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she
 31396	gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.
 31397	
 31398	âO God! I am lost!â she said to herself. âHow could I let him?â
 31399	She sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to
 31400	realize what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand
 31401	what had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure,
 31402	and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater where the
 31403	bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the
 31404	music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the nearly
 31405	naked HÃ©lÃ¨ne with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried
 31406	âbravo!ââthere in the presence of that HÃ©lÃ¨ne it had all seemed
 31407	clear and simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible.
 31408	âWhat is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this gnawing
 31409	of conscience I am feeling now?â she thought.
 31410	
 31411	Only to the old countess at night in bed could NatÃ¡sha have told all
 31412	she was feeling. She knew that SÃ³nya with her severe and simple views
 31413	would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such
 31414	a confession. So NatÃ¡sha tried to solve what was torturing her by
 31415	herself.
 31416	
 31417	âAm I spoiled for Andrewâs love or not?â she asked herself, and
 31418	with soothing irony replied: âWhat a fool I am to ask that! What did
 31419	happen to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didnât lead him on
 31420	at all. Nobody will know and I shall never see him again,â she told
 31421	herself. âSo it is plain that nothing has happened and there is
 31422	nothing to repent of, and Andrew can love me still. But why âstill?â
 31423	O God, why isnât he here?â NatÃ¡sha quieted herself for a moment,
 31424	but again some instinct told her that though all this was true, and
 31425	though nothing had happened, yet the former purity of her love for
 31426	Prince Andrew had perished. And again in imagination she went over her
 31427	whole conversation with KurÃ¡gin, and again saw the face, gestures, and
 31428	tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.
 31429	
 31430	
 31431	
 31432	
 31433	
 31434	CHAPTER XI
 31435	
 31436	Anatole KurÃ¡gin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him
 31437	away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
 31438	a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his
 31439	creditors demanded from his father.
 31440	
 31441	His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the
 31442	last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to
 31443	the commander in chiefâa post his father had procured for himâand
 31444	would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to him
 31445	Princess Mary and Julie KarÃ¡gina.
 31446	
 31447	Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierreâs
 31448	house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him
 31449	after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave
 31450	him money under the guise of loans.
 31451	
 31452	As ShinshÃ­n had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had
 31453	turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that
 31454	he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French
 31455	actressesâwith the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to
 31456	be on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at DanÃ­lovâs
 31457	or other Moscow revelersâ, drank whole nights through, outvying
 31458	everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the best society.
 31459	There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted
 31460	with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried
 31461	girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain.
 31462	There was a special reason for this, as he had got married two years
 31463	beforeâa fact known only to his most intimate friends. At that time
 31464	while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had
 31465	forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole had very soon abandoned his
 31466	wife and, for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law,
 31467	had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.
 31468	
 31469	Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with
 31470	others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
 31471	impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
 31472	never in his life done anything base. He was incapable of considering
 31473	how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or
 31474	that action of his might be. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made
 31475	that it must live in water, so God had made him such that he must spend
 31476	thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in
 31477	society. He believed this so firmly that others, looking at him, were
 31478	persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place
 31479	in society or money, which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and
 31480	evidently would not repay.
 31481	
 31482	He was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was
 31483	not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could
 31484	he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by
 31485	spoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He
 31486	was not mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared
 31487	about was gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas there
 31488	was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of
 31489	considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others,
 31490	he honestly considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues
 31491	and bad people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.
 31492	
 31493	Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence
 31494	similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of
 31495	forgiveness. âAll will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all
 31496	will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.â
 31497	
 31498	DÃ³lokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and
 31499	his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and
 31500	dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade KurÃ¡gin and
 31501	made use of him for his own ends.
 31502	
 31503	Anatole was sincerely fond of DÃ³lokhov for his cleverness and
 31504	audacity. DÃ³lokhov, who needed Anatole KurÃ¡ginâs name, position, and
 31505	connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made
 31506	use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other
 31507	feel it. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole, the very
 31508	process of dominating anotherâs will was in itself a pleasure, a
 31509	habit, and a necessity to DÃ³lokhov.
 31510	
 31511	NatÃ¡sha had made a strong impression on KurÃ¡gin. At supper after
 31512	the opera he described to DÃ³lokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
 31513	attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his
 31514	intention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was incapable
 31515	of considering what might come of such love-making, as he never had any
 31516	notion of the outcome of any of his actions.
 31517	
 31518	âSheâs first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,â replied
 31519	DÃ³lokhov.
 31520	
 31521	âI will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,â said Anatole.
 31522	âEh?â
 31523	
 31524	âYouâd better wait till sheâs married....â
 31525	
 31526	âYou know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,â
 31527	pursued Anatole.
 31528	
 31529	âYou have been caught once already by a âlittle girl,ââ said
 31530	DÃ³lokhov who knew of KurÃ¡ginâs marriage. âTake care!â
 31531	
 31532	âWell, that canât happen twice! Eh?â said Anatole, with a
 31533	good-humored laugh.
 31534	
 31535	
 31536

 31539	CHAPTER XII
 31540	
 31541	The day after the opera the RostÃ³vs went nowhere and nobody came to see
 31542	them. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna talked to the count about something which they
 31543	concealed from NatÃ¡sha. NatÃ¡sha guessed they were talking about the
 31544	old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her.
 31545	She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a
 31546	manservant to the VozdvÃ­zhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had
 31547	not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.
 31548	To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
 31549	recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince,
 31550	and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She
 31551	continually fancied that either he would never come or that something
 31552	would happen to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by
 31553	herself calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she
 31554	began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of Princess
 31555	Mary, of the theater, and of KurÃ¡gin mingled with her thoughts. The
 31556	question again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she
 31557	had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found
 31558	herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and
 31559	every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had
 31560	been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
 31561	feeling. To the family NatÃ¡sha seemed livelier than usual, but she was
 31562	far less tranquil and happy than before.
 31563	
 31564	On Sunday morning MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna invited her visitors to Mass at her
 31565	parish churchâthe Church of the Assumption built over the graves of
 31566	victims of the plague.
 31567	
 31568	âI donât like those fashionable churches,â she said, evidently
 31569	priding herself on her independence of thought. âGod is the same
 31570	everywhere. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service
 31571	decently and with dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is
 31572	there in giving concerts in the choir? I donât like it, itâs just
 31573	self-indulgence!â
 31574	
 31575	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her whole
 31576	house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the
 31577	servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church. At
 31578	her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had vodka
 31579	and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was the
 31580	holiday so noticeable as in MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs broad, stern face,
 31581	which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.
 31582	
 31583	After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room
 31584	where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant
 31585	announced that the carriage was ready, and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna rose with
 31586	a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and
 31587	announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski to have
 31588	an explanation with him about NatÃ¡sha.
 31589	
 31590	After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on
 31591	the RostÃ³vs, and NatÃ¡sha, very glad of this diversion, having shut
 31592	herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying
 31593	on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and
 31594	only tacked together, and was turning her head to see in the glass how
 31595	the back fitted, she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds
 31596	of her fatherâs voice and anotherâsâa womanâsâthat made her
 31597	flush. It was HÃ©lÃ¨ne. NatÃ¡sha had not time to take off the bodice
 31598	before the door opened and Countess BezÃºkhova, dressed in a purple
 31599	velvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with
 31600	good-humored amiable smiles.
 31601	
 31602	âOh, my enchantress!â she cried to the blushing NatÃ¡sha.
 31603	âCharming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,â said
 31604	she to Count RostÃ³v who had followed her in. âHow can you live in
 31605	Moscow and go nowhere? No, I wonât let you off! Mademoiselle George
 31606	will recite at my house tonight and thereâll be some people, and if
 31607	you donât bring your lovely girlsâwho are prettier than Mademoiselle
 31608	GeorgeâI wonât know you! My husband is away in Tver or I would send
 31609	him to fetch you. You must come. You positively must! Between eight and
 31610	nine.â
 31611	
 31612	She nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied
 31613	respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the
 31614	looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. She
 31615	did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising
 31616	NatÃ¡shaâs beauty. She looked at NatÃ¡shaâs dresses and praised
 31617	them, as well as a new dress of her own made of âmetallic gauze,â
 31618	which she had received from Paris, and advised NatÃ¡sha to have one like
 31619	it.
 31620	
 31621	âBut anything suits you, my charmer!â she remarked.
 31622	
 31623	A smile of pleasure never left NatÃ¡shaâs face. She felt happy and as
 31624	if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess BezÃºkhova
 31625	who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was
 31626	now so kind to her. NatÃ¡sha brightened up and felt almost in love with
 31627	this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind. HÃ©lÃ¨ne for her part was
 31628	sincerely delighted with NatÃ¡sha and wished to give her a good time.
 31629	Anatole had asked her to bring him and NatÃ¡sha together, and she was
 31630	calling on the RostÃ³vs for that purpose. The idea of throwing her
 31631	brother and NatÃ¡sha together amused her.
 31632	
 31633	Though at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with NatÃ¡sha
 31634	for drawing BorÃ­s away, she did not think of that now, and in her own
 31635	way heartily wished NatÃ¡sha well. As she was leaving the RostÃ³vs she
 31636	called her protÃ©gÃ©e aside.
 31637	
 31638	âMy brother dined with me yesterdayâwe nearly died of laughterâhe
 31639	ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite
 31640	madly, in love with you, my dear.â
 31641	
 31642	NatÃ¡sha blushed scarlet when she heard this.
 31643	
 31644	âHow she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne. âYou
 31645	must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a
 31646	reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your
 31647	fiancÃ© would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to
 31648	death.â
 31649	
 31650	âSo she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierreâthat good
 31651	Pierreâhave talked and laughed about this. So itâs all right.â And
 31652	again, under HÃ©lÃ¨neâs influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed
 31653	simple and natural. âAnd she is such a grande dame, so kind, and
 31654	evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?â thought
 31655	NatÃ¡sha, gazing at HÃ©lÃ¨ne with wide-open, wondering eyes.
 31656	
 31657	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having
 31658	evidently suffered a defeat at the old princeâs. She was still too
 31659	agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly. In
 31660	answer to the countâs inquiries she replied that things were all
 31661	right and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of Countess
 31662	BezÃºkhovaâs visit and the invitation for that evening, MÃ¡rya
 31663	DmÃ­trievna remarked:
 31664	
 31665	âI donât care to have anything to do with BezÃºkhova and donât
 31666	advise you to; however, if youâve promisedâgo. It will divert your
 31667	thoughts,â she added, addressing NatÃ¡sha.
 31668	
 31669	
 31670	
 31671	
 31672	
 31673	CHAPTER XIII
 31674	
 31675	Count RostÃ³v took the girls to Countess BezÃºkhovaâs. There were
 31676	a good many people there, but nearly all strangers to NatÃ¡sha. Count
 31677	RostÃ³v was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely
 31678	of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct. Mademoiselle
 31679	George was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young
 31680	men. There were several Frenchmen present, among them MÃ©tivier who from
 31681	the time HÃ©lÃ¨ne reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house. The
 31682	count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight
 31683	and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle Georgeâs performance was over.
 31684	
 31685	Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the RostÃ³vs.
 31686	Immediately after greeting the count he went up to NatÃ¡sha and followed
 31687	her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
 31688	had at the operaâgratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
 31689	the absence of a moral barrier between them.
 31690	
 31691	HÃ©lÃ¨ne welcomed NatÃ¡sha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her
 31692	beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went
 31693	out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people began
 31694	arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a chair for
 31695	NatÃ¡sha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count, who never
 31696	lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down behind her.
 31697	
 31698	Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl
 31699	draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and
 31700	assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was audible.
 31701	
 31702	Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and
 31703	began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her
 31704	son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered,
 31705	lifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse
 31706	sounds, rolling her eyes.
 31707	
 31708	âAdorable! divine! delicious!â was heard from every side.
 31709	
 31710	NatÃ¡sha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor
 31711	understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself
 31712	again completely borne away into this strange senseless worldâso
 31713	remote from her old worldâa world in which it was impossible to know
 31714	what was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole,
 31715	and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
 31716	expectancy.
 31717	
 31718	After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
 31719	Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.
 31720	
 31721	âHow beautiful she is!â NatÃ¡sha remarked to her father who had also
 31722	risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.
 31723	
 31724	âI donât think so when I look at you!â said Anatole, following
 31725	NatÃ¡sha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him. âYou
 31726	are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased...â
 31727	
 31728	âCome, come, NatÃ¡sha!â said the count, as he turned back for his
 31729	daughter. âHow beautiful she is!â NatÃ¡sha without saying anything
 31730	stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
 31731	eyes.
 31732	
 31733	After giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and Countess
 31734	BezÃºkhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.
 31735	
 31736	The count wished to go home, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne entreated him not to spoil her
 31737	improvised ball, and the RostÃ³vs stayed on. Anatole asked NatÃ¡sha for
 31738	a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her
 31739	she was bewitching and that he loved her. During the Ã©cossaise, which
 31740	she also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when they happened to be
 31741	by themselves, but merely gazed at her. NatÃ¡sha lifted her frightened
 31742	eyes to him, but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate
 31743	look and smile that she could not, whilst looking at him, say what she
 31744	had to say. She lowered her eyes.
 31745	
 31746	âDonât say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,â
 31747	she said rapidly.... She glanced at him.
 31748	
 31749	Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.
 31750	
 31751	âDonât speak to me of that! What can I do?â said he. âI tell
 31752	you I am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are
 31753	enchanting?... Itâs our turn to begin.â
 31754	
 31755	NatÃ¡sha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open
 31756	frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly
 31757	anything that went on that evening. They danced the Ã©cossaise and the
 31758	Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain.
 31759	Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt his eyes
 31760	upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let
 31761	her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that HÃ©lÃ¨ne had
 31762	followed her and spoken laughingly of her brotherâs love, and that she
 31763	again met Anatole in the little sitting room. HÃ©lÃ¨ne had disappeared
 31764	leaving them alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender
 31765	voice:
 31766	
 31767	âI cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see
 31768	you? I love you madly. Can I never...?â and, blocking her path, he
 31769	brought his face close to hers.
 31770	
 31771	His large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw
 31772	nothing but them.
 31773	
 31774	âNatalie?â he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
 31775	painfully pressed. âNatalie?â
 31776	
 31777	âI donât understand. I have nothing to say,â her eyes replied.
 31778	
 31779	Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she felt
 31780	herself released, and HÃ©lÃ¨neâs footsteps and the rustle of her dress
 31781	were heard in the room. NatÃ¡sha looked round at her, and then, red
 31782	and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved
 31783	toward the door.
 31784	
 31785	âOne word, just one, for Godâs sake!â cried Anatole.
 31786	
 31787	She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what
 31788	had happened and to which she could find no answer.
 31789	
 31790	âNatalie, just a word, only one!â he kept repeating, evidently not
 31791	knowing what to say and he repeated it till HÃ©lÃ¨ne came up to them.
 31792	
 31793	HÃ©lÃ¨ne returned with NatÃ¡sha to the drawing room. The RostÃ³vs went
 31794	away without staying for supper.
 31795	
 31796	After reaching home NatÃ¡sha did not sleep all night. She was tormented
 31797	by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew.
 31798	She loved Prince Andrewâshe remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
 31799	him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. âElse how
 31800	could all this have happened?â thought she. âIf, after that, I could
 31801	return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to
 31802	that, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is
 31803	kind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I to
 31804	do if I love him and the other one too?â she asked herself, unable to
 31805	find an answer to these terrible questions.
 31806	
 31807	
 31808	
 31809	
 31810	
 31811	CHAPTER XIV
 31812	
 31813	Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began
 31814	to move about and talk, dressmakers came again. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
 31815	appeared, and they were called to breakfast. NatÃ¡sha kept looking
 31816	uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept
 31817	every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.
 31818	
 31819	After breakfast, which was her best time, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna sat down in
 31820	her armchair and called NatÃ¡sha and the count to her.
 31821	
 31822	âWell, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is
 31823	my advice,â she began. âYesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince
 31824	BolkÃ³nski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to
 31825	begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had
 31826	to say!â
 31827	
 31828	âWell, and he?â asked the count.
 31829	
 31830	âHe? Heâs crazy... he did not want to listen. But whatâs the use
 31831	of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,â said MÃ¡rya
 31832	DmÃ­trievna. âMy advice to you is finish your business and go back
 31833	home to OtrÃ¡dnoe... and wait there.â
 31834	
 31835	âOh, no!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha.
 31836	
 31837	âYes, go back,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, âand wait there. If your
 31838	betrothed comes here nowâthere will be no avoiding a quarrel; but
 31839	alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to
 31840	you.â
 31841	
 31842	Count RostÃ³v approved of this suggestion, appreciating its
 31843	reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better to
 31844	visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding,
 31845	against his wishes, could only be arranged at OtrÃ¡dnoe.
 31846	
 31847	âThat is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took
 31848	her,â said the old count.
 31849	
 31850	âNo, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he
 31851	wonâtâthatâs his affair,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, looking for
 31852	something in her reticule. âBesides, the trousseau is ready, so there
 31853	is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready Iâll send after you.
 31854	Though I donât like letting you go, it is the best way. So go, with
 31855	Godâs blessing!â
 31856	
 31857	Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to
 31858	NatÃ¡sha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.
 31859	
 31860	âShe has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! Sheâs
 31861	afraid you might think that she does not like you.â
 31862	
 31863	âBut she doesnât like me,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 31864	
 31865	âDonât talk nonsense!â cried MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
 31866	
 31867	âI shanât believe anyone, I know she doesnât like me,â replied
 31868	NatÃ¡sha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold
 31869	and angry resolution that caused MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna to look at her more
 31870	intently and to frown.
 31871	
 31872	âDonât answer like that, my good girl!â she said. âWhat I say is
 31873	true! Write an answer!â
 31874	
 31875	NatÃ¡sha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess
 31876	Maryâs letter.
 31877	
 31878	Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that
 31879	had occurred between them. Whatever her fatherâs feelings might be,
 31880	she begged NatÃ¡sha to believe that she could not help loving her as
 31881	the one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to
 31882	sacrifice everything.
 31883	
 31884	âDo not think, however,â she wrote, âthat my father is
 31885	ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be
 31886	forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his
 31887	son happy.â Princess Mary went on to ask NatÃ¡sha to fix a time when
 31888	she could see her again.
 31889	
 31890	After reading the letter NatÃ¡sha sat down at the writing table
 31891	to answer it. âDear Princess,â she wrote in French quickly and
 31892	mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all that
 31893	had happened the evening before? âYes, yes! All that has happened, and
 31894	now all is changed,â she thought as she sat with the letter she had
 31895	begun before her. âMust I break off with him? Must I really? Thatâs
 31896	awful...â and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to
 31897	SÃ³nya and began sorting patterns with her.
 31898	
 31899	After dinner NatÃ¡sha went to her room and again took up Princess
 31900	Maryâs letter. âCan it be that it is all over?â she thought.
 31901	âCan it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all
 31902	that went before?â She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its
 31903	former strength, and at the same time felt that she loved KurÃ¡gin. She
 31904	vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrewâs wife, and the scenes of
 31905	happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and
 31906	at the same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of
 31907	yesterdayâs interview with Anatole.
 31908	
 31909	âWhy could that not be as well?â she sometimes asked herself in
 31910	complete bewilderment. âOnly so could I be completely happy; but now I
 31911	have to choose, and I canât be happy without either of them. Only,â
 31912	she thought, âto tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide
 31913	it from him are both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is
 31914	spoiled. But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrewâs
 31915	love, in which I have lived so long?â
 31916	
 31917	âPlease, Miss!â whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
 31918	air. âA man told me to give you thisââ and she handed NatÃ¡sha a
 31919	letter.
 31920	
 31921	âOnly, for Christâs sake...â the girl went on, as NatÃ¡sha,
 31922	without thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter
 31923	from Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only
 31924	that it was a letter from himâfrom the man she loved. Yes, she loved
 31925	him, or else how could that have happened which had happened? And how
 31926	could she have a love letter from him in her hand?
 31927	
 31928	With trembling hands NatÃ¡sha held that passionate love letter which
 31929	DÃ³lokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she found in it
 31930	an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.
 31931	
 31932	âSince yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you
 31933	or to die. There is no other way for me,â the letter began. Then he
 31934	went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to himâfor
 31935	this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to herâbut that if
 31936	she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power could
 31937	hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and
 31938	carry her off to the ends of the earth.
 31939	
 31940	âYes, yes! I love him!â thought NatÃ¡sha, reading the letter for the
 31941	twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
 31942	it.
 31943	
 31944	That evening MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna was going to the AkhÃ¡rovsâ and
 31945	proposed to take the girls with her. NatÃ¡sha, pleading a headache,
 31946	remained at home.
 31947	
 31948	
 31949	
 31950	
 31951	
 31952	CHAPTER XV
 31953	
 31954	On returning late in the evening SÃ³nya went to NatÃ¡shaâs room, and
 31955	to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open on
 31956	the table, beside her lay Anatoleâs letter. SÃ³nya picked it up and
 31957	read it.
 31958	
 31959	As she read she glanced at the sleeping NatÃ¡sha, trying to find in her
 31960	face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find it. Her
 31961	face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep herself
 31962	from choking, SÃ³nya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat
 31963	down in an armchair and burst into tears.
 31964	
 31965	âHow was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have
 31966	left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let KurÃ¡gin go to
 31967	such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, thatâs plain! What will
 31968	Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is
 31969	the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before
 31970	yesterday, yesterday, and today,â thought SÃ³nya. âBut it canât be
 31971	that she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who
 31972	it was from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a
 31973	thing!â
 31974	
 31975	SÃ³nya wiped away her tears and went up to NatÃ¡sha, again scanning her
 31976	face.
 31977	
 31978	âNatÃ¡sha!â she said, just audibly.
 31979	
 31980	NatÃ¡sha awoke and saw SÃ³nya.
 31981	
 31982	âAh, youâre back?â
 31983	
 31984	And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of
 31985	awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing SÃ³nyaâs look of
 31986	embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.
 31987	
 31988	âSÃ³nya, youâve read that letter?â she demanded.
 31989	
 31990	âYes,â answered SÃ³nya softly.
 31991	
 31992	NatÃ¡sha smiled rapturously.
 31993	
 31994	âNo, SÃ³nya, I canât any longer!â she said. âI canât hide it
 31995	from you any longer. You know, we love one another! SÃ³nya, darling, he
 31996	writes... SÃ³nya...â
 31997	
 31998	SÃ³nya stared open-eyed at NatÃ¡sha, unable to believe her ears.
 31999	
 32000	âAnd BolkÃ³nski?â she asked.
 32001	
 32002	âAh, SÃ³nya, if you only knew how happy I am!â cried NatÃ¡sha.
 32003	âYou donât know what love is....â
 32004	
 32005	âBut, NatÃ¡sha, can that be all over?â
 32006	
 32007	NatÃ¡sha looked at SÃ³nya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp
 32008	the question.
 32009	
 32010	âWell, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?â said SÃ³nya.
 32011	
 32012	âOh, you donât understand anything! Donât talk nonsense, just
 32013	listen!â said NatÃ¡sha, with momentary vexation.
 32014	
 32015	âBut I canât believe it,â insisted SÃ³nya. âI donât
 32016	understand. How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and
 32017	suddenly... Why, you have only seen him three times! NatÃ¡sha, I donât
 32018	believe you, youâre joking! In three days to forget everything and
 32019	so...â
 32020	
 32021	âThree days?â said NatÃ¡sha. âIt seems to me Iâve loved him a
 32022	hundred years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You
 32023	canât understand it.... SÃ³nya, wait a bit, sit here,â and NatÃ¡sha
 32024	embraced and kissed her.
 32025	
 32026	âI had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it
 32027	too, but itâs only now that I feel such love. Itâs not the same as
 32028	before. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave,
 32029	and that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders
 32030	I shall do. You donât understand that. What can I do? What can I do,
 32031	SÃ³nya?â cried NatÃ¡sha with a happy yet frightened expression.
 32032	
 32033	âBut think what you are doing,â cried SÃ³nya. âI canât leave
 32034	it like this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so
 32035	far?â she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.
 32036	
 32037	âI told you that I have no will,â NatÃ¡sha replied. âWhy canât
 32038	you understand? I love him!â
 32039	
 32040	âThen I wonât let it come to that... I shall tell!â cried SÃ³nya,
 32041	bursting into tears.
 32042	
 32043	âWhat do you mean? For Godâs sake... If you tell, you are my
 32044	enemy!â declared NatÃ¡sha. âYou want me to be miserable, you want us
 32045	to be separated....â
 32046	
 32047	When she saw NatÃ¡shaâs fright, SÃ³nya shed tears of shame and pity
 32048	for her friend.
 32049	
 32050	âBut what has happened between you?â she asked. âWhat has he said
 32051	to you? Why doesnât he come to the house?â
 32052	
 32053	NatÃ¡sha did not answer her questions.
 32054	
 32055	âFor Godâs sake, SÃ³nya, donât tell anyone, donât torture
 32056	me,â NatÃ¡sha entreated. âRemember no one ought to interfere in such
 32057	matters! I have confided in you....â
 32058	
 32059	âBut why this secrecy? Why doesnât he come to the house?â asked
 32060	SÃ³nya. âWhy doesnât he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince
 32061	Andrew gave you complete freedomâif it is really so; but I donât
 32062	believe it! NatÃ¡sha, have you considered what these secret reasons can
 32063	be?â
 32064	
 32065	NatÃ¡sha looked at SÃ³nya with astonishment. Evidently this question
 32066	presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how
 32067	to answer it.
 32068	
 32069	âI donât know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!â
 32070	
 32071	SÃ³nya sighed and shook her head incredulously.
 32072	
 32073	âIf there were reasons...â she began.
 32074	
 32075	But NatÃ¡sha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.
 32076	
 32077	âSÃ³nya, one canât doubt him! One canât, one canât! Donât you
 32078	understand?â she cried.
 32079	
 32080	âDoes he love you?â
 32081	
 32082	âDoes he love me?â NatÃ¡sha repeated with a smile of pity at her
 32083	friendâs lack of comprehension. âWhy, you have read his letter and
 32084	you have seen him.â
 32085	
 32086	âBut if he is dishonorable?â
 32087	
 32088	âHe! dishonorable? If you only knew!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha.
 32089	
 32090	âIf he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or
 32091	cease seeing you; and if you wonât do this, I will. I will write to
 32092	him, and I will tell Papa!â said SÃ³nya resolutely.
 32093	
 32094	âBut I canât live without him!â cried NatÃ¡sha.
 32095	
 32096	âNatÃ¡sha, I donât understand you. And what are you saying! Think of
 32097	your father and of Nicholas.â
 32098	
 32099	âI donât want anyone, I donât love anyone but him. How dare you
 32100	say he is dishonorable? Donât you know that I love him?â screamed
 32101	NatÃ¡sha. âGo away, SÃ³nya! I donât want to quarrel with you, but
 32102	go, for Godâs sake go! You see how I am suffering!â NatÃ¡sha cried
 32103	angrily, in a voice of despair and repressed irritation. SÃ³nya burst
 32104	into sobs and ran from the room.
 32105	
 32106	NatÃ¡sha went to the table and without a momentâs reflection wrote
 32107	that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all
 32108	the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their
 32109	misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the
 32110	magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
 32111	freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her
 32112	if she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his
 32113	wife. At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to
 32114	NatÃ¡sha.
 32115	
 32116	
 32117	On Friday the RostÃ³vs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday
 32118	the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.
 32119	
 32120	On the day the count left, SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha were invited to a big
 32121	dinner party at the KarÃ¡ginsâ, and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna took them
 32122	there. At that party NatÃ¡sha again met Anatole, and SÃ³nya noticed
 32123	that she spoke to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through
 32124	dinner she was more agitated than ever. When they got home NatÃ¡sha was
 32125	the first to begin the explanation SÃ³nya expected.
 32126	
 32127	âThere, SÃ³nya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,â
 32128	NatÃ¡sha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be
 32129	praised. âWe have had an explanation today.â
 32130	
 32131	âWell, what happened? What did he say? NatÃ¡sha, how glad I am
 32132	youâre not angry with me! Tell me everythingâthe whole truth. What
 32133	did he say?â
 32134	
 32135	NatÃ¡sha became thoughtful.
 32136	
 32137	âOh, SÃ³nya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I
 32138	had promised BolkÃ³nski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.â
 32139	
 32140	SÃ³nya sighed sorrowfully.
 32141	
 32142	âBut you havenât refused BolkÃ³nski?â said she.
 32143	
 32144	âPerhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and BolkÃ³nski. Why do
 32145	you think so badly of me?â
 32146	
 32147	âI donât think anything, only I donât understand this...â
 32148	
 32149	âWait a bit, SÃ³nya, youâll understand everything. Youâll see what
 32150	a man he is! Now donât think badly of me or of him. I donât think
 32151	badly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?â
 32152	
 32153	SÃ³nya did not succumb to the tender tone NatÃ¡sha used toward her.
 32154	The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of NatÃ¡shaâs face
 32155	became, the more serious and stern grew SÃ³nyaâs.
 32156	
 32157	âNatÃ¡sha,â said she, âyou asked me not to speak to you, and I
 32158	havenât spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I donât trust him,
 32159	NatÃ¡sha. Why this secrecy?â
 32160	
 32161	âAgain, again!â interrupted NatÃ¡sha.
 32162	
 32163	âNatÃ¡sha, I am afraid for you!â
 32164	
 32165	âAfraid of what?â
 32166	
 32167	âI am afraid youâre going to your ruin,â said SÃ³nya resolutely,
 32168	and was herself horrified at what she had said.
 32169	
 32170	Anger again showed in NatÃ¡shaâs face.
 32171	
 32172	âAnd Iâll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! Itâs not
 32173	your business! It wonât be you, but I, whoâll suffer. Leave me
 32174	alone, leave me alone! I hate you!â
 32175	
 32176	âNatÃ¡sha!â moaned SÃ³nya, aghast.
 32177	
 32178	âI hate you, I hate you! Youâre my enemy forever!â And NatÃ¡sha
 32179	ran out of the room.
 32180	
 32181	NatÃ¡sha did not speak to SÃ³nya again and avoided her. With the same
 32182	expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house,
 32183	taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.
 32184	
 32185	Hard as it was for SÃ³nya, she watched her friend and did not let her
 32186	out of her sight.
 32187	
 32188	The day before the count was to return, SÃ³nya noticed that NatÃ¡sha sat
 32189	by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and
 32190	that she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom SÃ³nya took to
 32191	be Anatole.
 32192	
 32193	SÃ³nya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that
 32194	at dinner and all that evening NatÃ¡sha was in a strange and unnatural
 32195	state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she did not
 32196	finish, and laughed at everything.
 32197	
 32198	After tea SÃ³nya noticed a housemaid at NatÃ¡shaâs door timidly
 32199	waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at
 32200	the door learned that another letter had been delivered.
 32201	
 32202	Then suddenly it became clear to SÃ³nya that NatÃ¡sha had some dreadful
 32203	plan for that evening. SÃ³nya knocked at her door. NatÃ¡sha did not let
 32204	her in.
 32205	
 32206	âShe will run away with him!â thought SÃ³nya. âShe is capable of
 32207	anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in
 32208	her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,â SÃ³nya
 32209	remembered. âYes, thatâs it, she means to elope with him, but
 32210	what am I to do?â thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly
 32211	indicated that NatÃ¡sha had some terrible intention. âThe count is
 32212	away. What am I to do? Write to KurÃ¡gin demanding an explanation? But
 32213	what is there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew
 32214	asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she really
 32215	has already refused BolkÃ³nskiâshe sent a letter to Princess Mary
 32216	yesterday. And Uncle is away....â To tell MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna who had
 32217	such faith in NatÃ¡sha seemed to SÃ³nya terrible. âWell, anyway,â
 32218	thought SÃ³nya as she stood in the dark passage, ânow or never I must
 32219	prove that I remember the familyâs goodness to me and that I love
 32220	Nicholas. Yes! If I donât sleep for three nights Iâll not leave this
 32221	passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family
 32222	be disgraced,â thought she.

 32228	CHAPTER XVI
 32229	
 32230	Anatole had lately moved to DÃ³lokhovâs. The plan for Natalie
 32231	RostÃ³vaâs abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by
 32232	DÃ³lokhov a few days before, and on the day that SÃ³nya, after listening
 32233	at NatÃ¡shaâs door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been
 32234	put into execution. NatÃ¡sha had promised to come out to KurÃ¡gin at the
 32235	back porch at ten that evening. KurÃ¡gin was to put her into a troyka
 32236	he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of
 32237	KÃ¡menka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a
 32238	marriage ceremony over them. At KÃ¡menka a relay of horses was to wait
 32239	which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would
 32240	hasten abroad with post horses.
 32241	
 32242	Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles
 32243	he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with
 32244	DÃ³lokhovâs help.
 32245	
 32246	Two witnesses for the mock marriageâKhvÃ³stikov, a retired petty
 32247	official whom DÃ³lokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and
 32248	MakÃ¡rin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded
 32249	affection for KurÃ¡ginâwere sitting at tea in DÃ³lokhovâs front
 32250	room.
 32251	
 32252	In his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with
 32253	Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat DÃ³lokhov in a traveling cloak
 32254	and high boots, at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles
 32255	of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from
 32256	the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room
 32257	behind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his
 32258	things. DÃ³lokhov was counting the money and noting something down.
 32259	
 32260	âWell,â he said, âKhvÃ³stikov must have two thousand.â
 32261	
 32262	âGive it to him, then,â said Anatole.
 32263	
 32264	âMakÃ¡rkaâ (their name for MakÃ¡rin) âwill go through fire and
 32265	water for you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,â said
 32266	DÃ³lokhov, showing him the memorandum. âIs that right?â
 32267	
 32268	âYes, of course,â returned Anatole, evidently not listening to
 32269	DÃ³lokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not
 32270	leave his face.
 32271	
 32272	DÃ³lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an
 32273	ironic smile:
 32274	
 32275	âDo you know? Youâd really better drop it all. Thereâs still
 32276	time!â
 32277	
 32278	âFool,â retorted Anatole. âDonât talk nonsense! If you only
 32279	knew... itâs the devil knows what!â
 32280	
 32281	âNo, really, give it up!â said DÃ³lokhov. âI am speaking
 32282	seriously. Itâs no joke, this plot youâve hatched.â
 32283	
 32284	âWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?â said Anatole, making a
 32285	grimace. âReally itâs no time for your stupid jokes,â and he left
 32286	the room.
 32287	
 32288	DÃ³lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had
 32289	gone out.
 32290	
 32291	âYou wait a bit,â he called after him. âIâm not joking, Iâm
 32292	talking sense. Come here, come here!â
 32293	
 32294	Anatole returned and looked at DÃ³lokhov, trying to give him his
 32295	attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.
 32296	
 32297	âNow listen to me. Iâm telling you this for the last time. Why
 32298	should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for
 32299	you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I
 32300	did it all.â
 32301	
 32302	âWell, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?â And
 32303	Anatole sighed and embraced DÃ³lokhov.
 32304	
 32305	âI helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a
 32306	dangerous business, and if you think about itâa stupid business. Well,
 32307	youâll carry her offâall right! Will they let it stop at that? It
 32308	will come out that youâre already married. Why, theyâll have you in
 32309	the criminal court....â
 32310	
 32311	âOh, nonsense, nonsense!â Anatole ejaculated and again made a
 32312	grimace. âDidnât I explain to you? What?â And Anatole, with the
 32313	partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached
 32314	by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to
 32315	DÃ³lokhov a hundred times. âDidnât I explain to you that I have come
 32316	to this conclusion: if this marriage is invalid,â he went on, crooking
 32317	one finger, âthen I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no
 32318	matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it. Isnât that so? And
 32319	donât talk to me, donât, donât.â
 32320	
 32321	âSeriously, youâd better drop it! Youâll only get yourself into a
 32322	mess!â
 32323	
 32324	âGo to the devil!â cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the
 32325	room, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of
 32326	DÃ³lokhov with his feet turned under him. âItâs the very devil!
 32327	What? Feel how it beats!â He took DÃ³lokhovâs hand and put it on his
 32328	heart. âWhat a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!â he
 32329	added in French. âWhat?â
 32330	
 32331	DÃ³lokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes
 32332	looked at himâevidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him.
 32333	
 32334	âWell and when the moneyâs gone, what then?â
 32335	
 32336	âWhat then? Eh?â repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a thought
 32337	of the future. âWhat then?... Then, I donât know.... But why talk
 32338	nonsense!â He glanced at his watch. âItâs time!â
 32339	
 32340	Anatole went into the back room.
 32341	
 32342	âNow then! Nearly ready? Youâre dawdling!â he shouted to the
 32343	servants.
 32344	
 32345	DÃ³lokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring
 32346	something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into
 32347	the room where KhvÃ³stikov and MakÃ¡rin were sitting.
 32348	
 32349	Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling
 32350	pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself.
 32351	
 32352	âCome and eat something. Have a drink!â DÃ³lokhov shouted to him
 32353	from the other room.
 32354	
 32355	âI donât want to,â answered Anatole continuing to smile.
 32356	
 32357	âCome! BalagÃ¡ is here.â
 32358	
 32359	Anatole rose and went into the dining room. BalagÃ¡ was a famous troyka
 32360	driver who had known DÃ³lokhov and Anatole some six years and had given
 32361	them good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatoleâs
 32362	regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the
 32363	evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again
 32364	the next night. More than once he had enabled DÃ³lokhov to escape when
 32365	pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies
 32366	and âladykinsâ as he called the cocottes. More than once in their
 32367	service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets
 32368	of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by âmy
 32369	gentlemenâ as he called them. He had ruined more than one horse in
 32370	their service. More than once they had beaten him, and more than once
 32371	they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and
 32372	he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have
 32373	sent an ordinary man to Siberia. They often called BalagÃ¡ into their
 32374	orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsiesâ, and more than one
 32375	thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands. In their
 32376	service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year, and in
 32377	their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would
 32378	buy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour,
 32379	liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at
 32380	full gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild,
 32381	tipsy shouts behind him: âGet on! Get on!â when it was impossible
 32382	to go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some
 32383	peasant who, more dead than alive, was already hurrying out of his way.
 32384	âReal gentlemen!â he considered them.
 32385	
 32386	Anatole and DÃ³lokhov liked BalagÃ¡ too for his masterly driving and
 32387	because he liked the things they liked. With others BalagÃ¡ bargained,
 32388	charging twenty-five rubles for a two hoursâ drive, and rarely
 32389	drove himself, generally letting his young men do so. But with âhis
 32390	gentlemenâ he always drove himself and never demanded anything for
 32391	his work. Only a couple of times a yearâwhen he knew from their valets
 32392	that they had money in handâhe would turn up of a morning quite sober
 32393	and with a deep bow would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always
 32394	made him sit down.
 32395	
 32396	âDo help me out, Theodore IvÃ¡nych, sir,â or âyour excellency,â
 32397	he would say. âI am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to
 32398	go to the fair.â
 32399	
 32400	And Anatole and DÃ³lokhov, when they had money, would give him a
 32401	thousand or a couple of thousand rubles.
 32402	
 32403	BalagÃ¡ was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about
 32404	twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, glittering
 32405	little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, dark-blue, silk-lined
 32406	cloth coat over a sheepskin.
 32407	
 32408	On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front
 32409	corner of the room, and went up to DÃ³lokhov, holding out a small, black
 32410	hand.
 32411	
 32412	âTheodore IvÃ¡nych!â he said, bowing.
 32413	
 32414	âHow dâyou do, friend? Well, here he is!â
 32415	
 32416	âGood day, your excellency!â he said, again holding out his hand to
 32417	Anatole who had just come in.
 32418	
 32419	âI say, BalagÃ¡,â said Anatole, putting his hands on the manâs
 32420	shoulders, âdo you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service....
 32421	What horses have you come with? Eh?â
 32422	
 32423	âAs your messenger ordered, your special beasts,â replied BalagÃ¡.
 32424	
 32425	âWell, listen, BalagÃ¡! Drive all three to death but get me there in
 32426	three hours. Eh?â
 32427	
 32428	âWhen they are dead, what shall I drive?â said BalagÃ¡ with a wink.
 32429	
 32430	âMind, Iâll smash your face in! Donât make jokes!â cried
 32431	Anatole, suddenly rolling his eyes.
 32432	
 32433	âWhy joke?â said the driver, laughing. âAs if Iâd grudge my
 32434	gentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast
 32435	weâll go!â
 32436	
 32437	âAh!â said Anatole. âWell, sit down.â
 32438	
 32439	âYes, sit down!â said DÃ³lokhov.
 32440	
 32441	âIâll stand, Theodore IvÃ¡nych.â
 32442	
 32443	âSit down; nonsense! Have a drink!â said Anatole, and filled a large
 32444	glass of Madeira for him.
 32445	
 32446	The driverâs eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing
 32447	it for mannersâ sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
 32448	handkerchief he took out of his cap.
 32449	
 32450	âAnd when are we to start, your excellency?â
 32451	
 32452	âWell...â Anatole looked at his watch. âWeâll start at once.
 32453	Mind, BalagÃ¡! Youâll get there in time? Eh?â
 32454	
 32455	âThat depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldnât we be
 32456	there in time?â replied BalagÃ¡. âDidnât we get you to Tver in
 32457	seven hours? I think you remember that, your excellency?â
 32458	
 32459	âDo you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,â said Anatole,
 32460	smilingly at the recollection and turning to MakÃ¡rin who gazed
 32461	rapturously at him with wide-open eyes. âWill you believe it,
 32462	MakÃ¡rka, it took oneâs breath away, the rate we flew. We came across
 32463	a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?â
 32464	
 32465	âThose were horses!â BalagÃ¡ continued the tale. âThat time Iâd
 32466	harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,â he went
 32467	on, turning to DÃ³lokhov. âWill you believe it, Theodore IvÃ¡nych,
 32468	those animals flew forty miles? I couldnât hold them in, my hands grew
 32469	numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reinsââCatch hold
 32470	yourself, your excellency!â says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom
 32471	of the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasnât a case of urging them on,
 32472	there was no holding them in till we reached the place. The devils took
 32473	us there in three hours! Only the near one died of it.â
 32474	
 32475	
 32476	
 32477	
 32478	
 32479	CHAPTER XVII
 32480	
 32481	Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing
 32482	a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one
 32483	side and very becoming to his handsome face. Having looked in a mirror,
 32484	and standing before DÃ³lokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it,
 32485	he lifted a glass of wine.
 32486	
 32487	âWell, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!â said
 32488	Anatole. âWell, comrades and friends...â he considered for a moment â...
 32489	of my youth, farewell!â he said, turning to MakÃ¡rin and the others.
 32490	
 32491	Though they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to make
 32492	something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades. He
 32493	spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed
 32494	one leg.
 32495	
 32496	âAll take glasses; you too, BalagÃ¡. Well, comrades and friends of my
 32497	youth, weâve had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when
 32498	shall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good timeânow
 32499	farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...â he cried, and emptying his
 32500	glass flung it on the floor.
 32501	
 32502	âTo your health!â said BalagÃ¡ who also emptied his glass, and wiped his
 32503	mouth with his handkerchief.
 32504	
 32505	MakÃ¡rin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.
 32506	
 32507	âAh, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!
 32508	
 32509	âLetâs go. Letâs go!â cried Anatole.
 32510	
 32511	BalagÃ¡ was about to leave the room.
 32512	
 32513	âNo, stop!â said Anatole. âShut the door; we have first to sit down.
 32514	Thatâs the way.â
 32515	
 32516	They shut the door and all sat down.
 32517	
 32518	âNow, quick march, lads!â said Anatole, rising.
 32519	
 32520	Joseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all
 32521	went out into the vestibule.
 32522	
 32523	âAnd whereâs the fur cloak?â asked DÃ³lokhov. âHey, IgnÃ¡tka! Go to
 32524	MatrÃ«na MatrÃ©vna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what
 32525	elopements are like,â continued DÃ³lokhov with a wink. âWhy, sheâll rush
 32526	out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay
 32527	at all thereâll be tears and âPapaâ and âMamma,â and sheâs frozen in a
 32528	minute and must go backâbut you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing
 32529	and carry her to the sleigh.â
 32530	
 32531	The valet brought a womanâs fox-lined cloak.
 32532	
 32533	âFool, I told you the sable one! Hey, MatrÃ«na, the sable!â he shouted so
 32534	that his voice rang far through the rooms.
 32535	
 32536	A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
 32537	and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable
 32538	mantle on her arm.
 32539	
 32540	âHere, I donât grudge itâtake it!â she said, evidently afraid of her
 32541	master and yet regretful of her cloak.
 32542	
 32543	DÃ³lokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over MatrÃ«na, and
 32544	wrapped her up in it.
 32545	
 32546	âThatâs the way,â said DÃ³lokhov, âand then so!â and he turned the collar
 32547	up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered. âAnd
 32548	then so, do you see?â and he pushed Anatoleâs head forward to meet the
 32549	gap left by the collar, through which MatrÃ«naâs brilliant smile was
 32550	seen.
 32551	
 32552	âWell, good-by, MatrÃ«na,â said Anatole, kissing her. âAh, my revels here
 32553	are over. Remember me to StÃ«shka. There, good-by! Good-by, MatrÃ«na, wish
 32554	me luck!â
 32555	
 32556	âWell, Prince, may God give you great luck!â said MatrÃ«na in her gypsy
 32557	accent.
 32558	
 32559	Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were
 32560	holding the horses. BalagÃ¡ took his seat in the front one and holding
 32561	his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and DÃ³lokhov
 32562	got in with him. MakÃ¡rin, KhvÃ³stikov, and a valet seated themselves in
 32563	the other sleigh.
 32564	
 32565	âWell, are you ready?â asked BalagÃ¡.
 32566	
 32567	âGo!â he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka tore
 32568	down the NikÃ­tski Boulevard.
 32569	
 32570	âTproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...â The shouting of BalagÃ¡
 32571	and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could
 32572	be heard. On the ArbÃ¡t Square the troyka caught against a carriage;
 32573	something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the
 32574	ArbÃ¡t Street.
 32575	
 32576	After taking a turn along the PodnovÃ­nski Boulevard, BalagÃ¡ began to
 32577	rein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old KonyÃºsheny
 32578	Street.
 32579	
 32580	The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole
 32581	and DÃ³lokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the gate
 32582	DÃ³lokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.
 32583	
 32584	âCome into the courtyard or youâll be seen; sheâll come out directly,â
 32585	said she.
 32586	
 32587	DÃ³lokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the
 32588	courtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.
 32589	
 32590	He was met by Gabriel, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs gigantic footman.
 32591	
 32592	âCome to the mistress, please,â said the footman in his deep bass,
 32593	intercepting any retreat.
 32594	
 32595	âTo what Mistress? Who are you?â asked Anatole in a breathless whisper.
 32596	
 32597	âKindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.â
 32598	
 32599	âKurÃ¡gin! Come back!â shouted DÃ³lokhov. âBetrayed! Back!â
 32600	
 32601	DÃ³lokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and was
 32602	struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With a last
 32603	desperate effort DÃ³lokhov pushed the porter aside, and when Anatole ran
 32604	back seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket, and ran back
 32605	with him to the troyka.
 32606

 32611	CHAPTER XVIII
 32612	
 32613	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, having found SÃ³nya weeping in the corridor, made her
 32614	confess everything, and intercepting the note to NatÃ¡sha she read it and
 32615	went into NatÃ¡shaâs room with it in her hand.
 32616	
 32617	âYou shameless good-for-nothing!â said she. âI wonât hear a word.â
 32618	
 32619	Pushing back NatÃ¡sha who looked at her with astonished but tearless
 32620	eyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the yard porter to
 32621	admit the persons who would be coming that evening, but not to let them
 32622	out again, and having told the footman to bring them up to her, she
 32623	seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors.
 32624	
 32625	When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run
 32626	away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced
 32627	through the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward
 32628	midnight she went to NatÃ¡shaâs room fingering the key in her pocket.
 32629	SÃ³nya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. âMÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, for Godâs
 32630	sake let me in to her!â she pleaded, but MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna unlocked
 32631	the door and went in without giving her an answer.... âDisgusting,
 32632	abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! Iâm only sorry for her
 32633	father!â thought she, trying to restrain her wrath. âHard as it may
 32634	be, Iâll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the
 32635	count.â She entered the room with resolute steps. NatÃ¡sha lying on the
 32636	sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she did not stir. She was in
 32637	just the same position in which MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna had left her.
 32638	
 32639	âA nice girl! Very nice!â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âArranging meetings
 32640	with lovers in my house! Itâs no use pretending: you listen when I speak
 32641	to you!â And MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna touched her arm. âListen when I speak!
 32642	Youâve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. Iâd treat you
 32643	differently, but Iâm sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.â
 32644	
 32645	NatÃ¡sha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved with
 32646	noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna glanced
 32647	round at SÃ³nya and seated herself on the sofa beside NatÃ¡sha.
 32648	
 32649	âItâs lucky for him that he escaped me; but Iâll find him!â she said in
 32650	her rough voice. âDo you hear what I am saying or not?â she added.
 32651	
 32652	She put her large hand under NatÃ¡shaâs face and turned it toward her.
 32653	Both MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna and SÃ³nya were amazed when they saw how NatÃ¡sha
 32654	looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her
 32655	cheeks sunken.
 32656	
 32657	âLet me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!â she muttered,
 32658	wrenching herself from MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs hands with a vicious effort
 32659	and sinking down again into her former position.
 32660	
 32661	âNatalie!â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âI wish for your good. Lie still,
 32662	stay like that then, I wonât touch you. But listen. I wonât tell you how
 32663	guilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your father comes back
 32664	tomorrow what am I to tell him? Eh?â
 32665	
 32666	Again NatÃ¡shaâs body shook with sobs.
 32667	
 32668	âSuppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?â
 32669	
 32670	âI have no betrothed: I have refused him!â cried NatÃ¡sha.
 32671	
 32672	âThatâs all the same,â continued MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âIf they hear of
 32673	this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he
 32674	challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?â
 32675	
 32676	âOh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked
 32677	you to?â shouted NatÃ¡sha, raising herself on the sofa and looking
 32678	malignantly at MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
 32679	
 32680	âBut what did you want?â cried MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, growing angry again.
 32681	âWere you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the house?
 32682	Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he
 32683	had carried you off... do you think they wouldnât have found him?
 32684	Your father, or brother, or your betrothed? And heâs a scoundrel, a
 32685	wretchâthatâs a fact!â
 32686	
 32687	âHe is better than any of you!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha getting up. âIf you
 32688	hadnât interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? SÃ³nya,
 32689	why?... Go away!â
 32690	
 32691	And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people
 32692	bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. MÃ¡rya
 32693	DmÃ­trievna was to speak again but NatÃ¡sha cried out:
 32694	
 32695	âGo away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!â and she threw herself
 32696	back on the sofa.
 32697	
 32698	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on her
 32699	that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody
 32700	would know anything about it if only NatÃ¡sha herself would undertake
 32701	to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened.
 32702	NatÃ¡sha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she grew cold
 32703	and had a shivering fit. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna put a pillow under her head,
 32704	covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower
 32705	water, but NatÃ¡sha did not respond to her.
 32706	
 32707	âWell, let her sleep,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna as she went out of the room
 32708	supposing NatÃ¡sha to be asleep.
 32709	
 32710	But NatÃ¡sha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she
 32711	looked straight before her. All that night she did not sleep or weep and
 32712	did not speak to SÃ³nya who got up and went to her several times.
 32713	
 32714	Next day Count RostÃ³v returned from his estate near Moscow in time for
 32715	lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the affair with
 32716	the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was nothing to keep
 32717	him any longer in Moscow, away from the countess whom he missed. MÃ¡rya
 32718	DmÃ­trievna met him and told him that NatÃ¡sha had been very unwell the
 32719	day before and that they had sent for the doctor, but that she was
 32720	better now. NatÃ¡sha had not left her room that morning. With compressed
 32721	and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily
 32722	watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at
 32723	anyone who entered the room. She was evidently expecting news of him and
 32724	that he would come or would write to her.
 32725	
 32726	When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound
 32727	of a manâs footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent
 32728	expression. She did not even get up to greet him. âWhat is the matter
 32729	with you, my angel? Are you ill?â asked the count.
 32730	
 32731	After a momentâs silence NatÃ¡sha answered: âYes, ill.â
 32732	
 32733	In reply to the countâs anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected
 32734	and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him
 32735	that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
 32736	confirmed NatÃ¡shaâs assurances that nothing had happened. From
 32737	the pretense of illness, from his daughterâs distress, and by the
 32738	embarrassed faces of SÃ³nya and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, the count saw clearly
 32739	that something had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible
 32740	for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved
 32741	daughter, and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he
 32742	avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly
 32743	had happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition
 32744	delayed their return to the country.
 32745	
 32746	
 32747	
 32748	
 32749	
 32750	CHAPTER XIX
 32751	
 32752	From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go
 32753	away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the RostÃ³vs came
 32754	to Moscow the effect NatÃ¡sha had on him made him hasten to carry out
 32755	his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs widow, who
 32756	had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased
 32757	husbandâs.
 32758	
 32759	When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from MÃ¡rya
 32760	DmÃ­trievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
 32761	importance relating to Andrew BolkÃ³nski and his betrothed. Pierre had
 32762	been avoiding NatÃ¡sha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her
 32763	was stronger than a married manâs should be for his friendâs fiancÃ©e.
 32764	Yet some fate constantly threw them together.
 32765	
 32766	âWhat can have happened? And what can they want with me?â thought he
 32767	as he dressed to go to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs. âIf only Prince Andrew would
 32768	hurry up and come and marry her!â thought he on his way to the house.
 32769	
 32770	On the TverskÃ³y Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.
 32771	
 32772	âPierre! Been back long?â someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In
 32773	a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the
 32774	dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion MakÃ¡rin dashed
 32775	past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military
 32776	dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his
 32777	head slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat,
 32778	tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled
 32779	with powdery snow.
 32780	
 32781	âYes, indeed, thatâs a true sage,â thought Pierre. âHe sees nothing
 32782	beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is
 32783	always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldnât I give to be like
 32784	him!â he thought enviously.
 32785	
 32786	In MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs anteroom the footman who helped him off with his
 32787	fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.
 32788	
 32789	When he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw NatÃ¡sha sitting at the
 32790	window, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at him,
 32791	frowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.
 32792	
 32793	âWhat has happened?â asked Pierre, entering MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs room.
 32794	
 32795	âFine doings!â answered DmÃ­trievna. âFor fifty-eight years have I lived
 32796	in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!â
 32797	
 32798	And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,
 32799	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna informed him that NatÃ¡sha had refused Prince Andrew
 32800	without her parentsâ knowledge and that the cause of this was Anatole
 32801	KurÃ¡gin into whose society Pierreâs wife had thrown her and with whom
 32802	NatÃ¡sha had tried to elope during her fatherâs absence, in order to be
 32803	married secretly.
 32804	
 32805	Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was told
 32806	him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrewâs
 32807	deeply loved affianced wifeâthe same NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va who used to be so
 32808	charmingâshould give up BolkÃ³nski for that fool Anatole who was already
 32809	secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as
 32810	to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive
 32811	and could not imagine.
 32812	
 32813	He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of NatÃ¡sha, whom
 32814	he had known from a child, with this new conception of her baseness,
 32815	folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. âThey are all alike!â he
 32816	said to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate
 32817	enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied Prince Andrew to
 32818	the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride, and the more
 32819	he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with
 32820	disgust of that NatÃ¡sha who had just passed him in the ballroom with
 32821	such a look of cold dignity. He did not know that NatÃ¡shaâs soul was
 32822	overflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation, and that it was not
 32823	her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity
 32824	and severity.
 32825	
 32826	âBut how get married?â said Pierre, in answer to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âHe
 32827	could not marryâhe is married!â
 32828	
 32829	âThings get worse from hour to hour!â ejaculated MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. âA
 32830	nice youth! What a scoundrel! And sheâs expecting himâexpecting him
 32831	since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she wonât go on
 32832	expecting him.â
 32833	
 32834	After hearing the details of Anatoleâs marriage from Pierre, and giving
 32835	vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
 32836	told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that the count or
 32837	BolkÃ³nski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair
 32838	(which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel,
 32839	and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to
 32840	leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierreâonly
 32841	now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince
 32842	Andrewâpromised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly
 32843	explained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.
 32844	
 32845	âMind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,â
 32846	she said. âAnd I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And
 32847	stay to dinner if you care to!â she called after Pierre.
 32848	
 32849	Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning
 32850	NatÃ¡sha had told him that she had rejected BolkÃ³nski.
 32851	
 32852	âTroubles, troubles, my dear fellow!â he said to Pierre. âWhat troubles
 32853	one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having
 32854	come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken
 32855	off her engagement without consulting anybody? Itâs true this engagement
 32856	never was much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but
 32857	still, with his fatherâs disapproval they wouldnât have been happy, and
 32858	NatÃ¡sha wonât lack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and
 32859	to take such a step without fatherâs or motherâs consent! And now sheâs
 32860	ill, and God knows what! Itâs hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in
 32861	their motherâs absence....â
 32862	
 32863	Pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the
 32864	subject, but the count returned to his troubles.
 32865	
 32866	SÃ³nya entered the room with an agitated face.
 32867	
 32868	âNatÃ¡sha is not quite well; sheâs in her room and would like to see you.
 32869	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna is with her and she too asks you to come.â
 32870	
 32871	âYes, you are a great friend of BolkÃ³nskiâs, no doubt she wants to send
 32872	him a message,â said the count. âOh dear! Oh dear! How happy it all
 32873	was!â
 32874	
 32875	And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the
 32876	room.
 32877	
 32878	When MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna told NatÃ¡sha that Anatole was married, NatÃ¡sha
 32879	did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre
 32880	himself. SÃ³nya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to
 32881	NatÃ¡shaâs room.
 32882	
 32883	NatÃ¡sha, pale and stern, was sitting beside MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, and her
 32884	eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the
 32885	moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed fixedly at
 32886	him, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or like the
 32887	others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he evidently did
 32888	not exist for her.
 32889	
 32890	âHe knows all about it,â said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna pointing to Pierre and
 32891	addressing NatÃ¡sha. âLet him tell you whether I have told the truth.â
 32892	
 32893	NatÃ¡sha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal
 32894	looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.
 32895	
 32896	âNatÃ¡lya IlynÃ­chna,â Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a feeling of
 32897	pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do, âwhether it is
 32898	true or not should make no difference to you, because...â
 32899	
 32900	âThen it is not true that heâs married!â
 32901	
 32902	âYes, it is true.â
 32903	
 32904	âHas he been married long?â she asked. âOn your honor?...â
 32905	
 32906	Pierre gave his word of honor.
 32907	
 32908	âIs he still here?â she asked, quickly.
 32909	
 32910	âYes, I have just seen him.â
 32911	
 32912	She was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that
 32913	they should leave her alone.
 32914	
 32915	
 32916	
 32917	
 32918	
 32919	CHAPTER XX
 32920	
 32921	Pierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at once.
 32922	He drove through the town seeking Anatole KurÃ¡gin, at the thought of
 32923	whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in
 32924	breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsiesâ, nor at
 32925	Komonenoâs. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as
 32926	usual. The members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about
 32927	in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news. The footman
 32928	having greeted him, knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him
 32929	there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that Prince
 32930	Michael ZakhÃ¡rych was in the library, but Paul TimofÃ©evich had not yet
 32931	arrived. One of Pierreâs acquaintances, while they were talking about
 32932	the weather, asked if he had heard of KurÃ¡ginâs abduction of RostÃ³va
 32933	which was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and
 32934	said it was nonsense for he had just come from the RostÃ³vsâ. He asked
 32935	everyone about Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and
 32936	another that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this
 32937	calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his
 32938	soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and
 32939	as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home.
 32940	
 32941	Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with DÃ³lokhov,
 32942	consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to
 32943	him essential to see NatÃ¡sha. In the evening he drove to his sisterâs
 32944	to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home
 32945	after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince
 32946	Anatole was with the countess. The countessâ drawing room was full of
 32947	guests.
 32948	
 32949	Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his
 32950	returnâat that moment she was more repulsive to him than everâentered
 32951	the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.
 32952	
 32953	âAh, Pierre,â said the countess going up to her husband. âYou donât know
 32954	what a plight our Anatole...â
 32955	
 32956	She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husbandâs head, in his
 32957	glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that
 32958	rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his
 32959	duel with DÃ³lokhov.
 32960	
 32961	âWhere you are, there is vice and evil!â said Pierre to his wife.
 32962	âAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,â he added in French.
 32963	
 32964	Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to
 32965	follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself
 32966	and was leading him from the room.
 32967	
 32968	âIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...â whispered HÃ©lÃ¨ne, but
 32969	Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.
 32970	
 32971	Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed
 32972	anxiety.
 32973	
 32974	Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole
 32975	without looking at him.
 32976	
 32977	âYou promised Countess RostÃ³va to marry her and were about to elope with
 32978	her, is that so?â
 32979	
 32980	âMon cher,â answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French),
 32981	âI donât consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that
 32982	tone.â
 32983	
 32984	Pierreâs face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole
 32985	by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side
 32986	to side till Anatoleâs face showed a sufficient degree of terror.
 32987	
 32988	âWhen I tell you that I must talk to you!...â repeated Pierre.
 32989	
 32990	âCome now, this is stupid. What?â said Anatole, fingering a button of
 32991	his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.
 32992	
 32993	âYouâre a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I donât know what deprives
 32994	me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!â said Pierre,
 32995	expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.
 32996	
 32997	He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put
 32998	it back in its place.
 32999	
 33000	âDid you promise to marry her?â
 33001	
 33002	âI... I didnât think of it. I never promised, because...â
 33003	
 33004	Pierre interrupted him.
 33005	
 33006	âHave you any letters of hers? Any letters?â he said, moving toward
 33007	Anatole.
 33008	
 33009	Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket
 33010	and drew out his pocketbook.
 33011	
 33012	Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table
 33013	that stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.
 33014	
 33015	âI shanât be violent, donât be afraid!â said Pierre in answer to a
 33016	frightened gesture of Anatoleâs. âFirst, the letters,â said he, as if
 33017	repeating a lesson to himself. âSecondly,â he continued after a short
 33018	pause, again rising and again pacing the room, âtomorrow you must get
 33019	out of Moscow.â
 33020	
 33021	âBut how can I?...â
 33022	
 33023	âThirdly,â Pierre continued without listening to him, âyou must never
 33024	breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess RostÃ³va.
 33025	I know I canât prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of
 33026	conscience...â Pierre paced the room several times in silence.
 33027	
 33028	Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.
 33029	
 33030	âAfter all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such
 33031	a thing as other peopleâs happiness and peace, and that you are ruining
 33032	a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women
 33033	like my wifeâwith them you are within your rights, for they know what
 33034	you want of them. They are armed against you by the same experience
 33035	of debauchery; but to promise a maid to marry her... to deceive, to
 33036	kidnap.... Donât you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man
 33037	or a child?...â
 33038	
 33039	Pierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a
 33040	questioning look.
 33041	
 33042	âI donât know about that, eh?â said Anatole, growing more confident as
 33043	Pierre mastered his wrath. âI donât know that and donât want to,â he
 33044	said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw,
 33045	âbut you have used such words to meââmeanâ and so onâwhich as a man of
 33046	honor I canât allow anyone to use.â
 33047	
 33048	Pierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he
 33049	wanted.
 33050	
 33051	âThough it was tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte,â Anatole continued, âstill I canât...â
 33052	
 33053	âIs it satisfaction you want?â said Pierre ironically.
 33054	
 33055	âYou could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do as
 33056	you wish, eh?â
 33057	
 33058	âI take them back, I take them back!â said Pierre, âand I ask you to
 33059	forgive me.â Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. âAnd if
 33060	you require money for your journey...â
 33061	
 33062	Anatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile, which
 33063	Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.
 33064	
 33065	âOh, vile and heartless brood!â he exclaimed, and left the room.
 33066	
 33067	Next day Anatole left for Petersburg.
 33068	
 33069	
 33070	
 33071	
 33072	
 33073	CHAPTER XXI
 33074	
 33075	Pierre drove to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs to tell her of the fulfillment of her
 33076	wish that KurÃ¡gin should be banished from Moscow. The whole house was in
 33077	a state of alarm and commotion. NatÃ¡sha was very ill, having, as MÃ¡rya
 33078	DmÃ­trievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had
 33079	been told that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily
 33080	procured. After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she
 33081	woke SÃ³nya and told her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had
 33082	been administered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so
 33083	weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and
 33084	so the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and
 33085	SÃ³nya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see NatÃ¡sha.
 33086	
 33087	Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about
 33088	the attempted abduction of RostÃ³va. He resolutely denied these
 33089	rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his
 33090	brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to
 33091	Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish
 33092	NatÃ¡shaâs reputation.
 33093	
 33094	He was awaiting Prince Andrewâs return with dread and went every day to
 33095	the old princeâs for news of him.
 33096	
 33097	Old Prince BolkÃ³nski heard all the rumors current in the town from
 33098	Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which
 33099	NatÃ¡sha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than
 33100	usual and awaited his son with great impatience.
 33101	
 33102	Some days after Anatoleâs departure Pierre received a note from Prince
 33103	Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.
 33104	
 33105	As soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his
 33106	father NatÃ¡shaâs note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement
 33107	(Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given
 33108	it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of NatÃ¡shaâs
 33109	elopement, with additions.
 33110	
 33111	Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next
 33112	morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state
 33113	as NatÃ¡sha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room
 33114	to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some
 33115	intrigue going on in Petersburg. The old princeâs voice and another now
 33116	and then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She
 33117	sighed, looking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was,
 33118	evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre
 33119	saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the
 33120	way her brother had taken the news of NatÃ¡shaâs faithlessness.
 33121	
 33122	âHe says he expected it,â she remarked. âI know his pride will not let
 33123	him express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far better,
 33124	than I expected. Evidently it had to be....â
 33125	
 33126	âBut is it possible that all is really ended?â asked Pierre.
 33127	
 33128	Princess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand
 33129	how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince
 33130	Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh
 33131	horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing
 33132	his father and Prince MeshchÃ©rski, warmly disputing and vigorously
 33133	gesticulating. The conversation was about SperÃ¡nskiâthe news of whose
 33134	sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.
 33135	
 33136	âNow he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him
 33137	a month ago,â Prince Andrew was saying, âand by those who were unable to
 33138	understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on
 33139	him all the blame of other menâs mistakes is very easy, but I maintain
 33140	that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by
 33141	him, by him alone.â
 33142	
 33143	He paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately
 33144	assumed a vindictive expression.
 33145	
 33146	âPosterity will do him justice,â he concluded, and at once turned to
 33147	Pierre.
 33148	
 33149	âWell, how are you? Still getting stouter?â he said with animation, but
 33150	the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. âYes, I am well,â he said in
 33151	answer to Pierreâs question, and smiled.
 33152	
 33153	To Pierre that smile said plainly: âI am well, but my health is now of
 33154	no use to anyone.â
 33155	
 33156	After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish
 33157	frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and
 33158	about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his sonâs
 33159	tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about
 33160	SperÃ¡nski which was still going on between the two old men.
 33161	
 33162	âIf there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon,
 33163	they would have been made public,â he said with warmth and haste. âI do
 33164	not, and never did, like SperÃ¡nski personally, but I like justice!â
 33165	
 33166	Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too
 33167	familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
 33168	in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate.
 33169	When Prince MeshchÃ©rski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierreâs arm and
 33170	asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made
 33171	up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince
 33172	Andrew went to one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a
 33173	packet wrapped in paper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He
 33174	stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.
 33175	
 33176	âForgive me for troubling you....â
 33177	
 33178	Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of NatÃ¡sha, and his
 33179	broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince
 33180	Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued:
 33181	
 33182	âI have received a refusal from Countess RostÃ³va and have heard reports
 33183	of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that
 33184	kind. Is that true?â
 33185	
 33186	âBoth true and untrue,â Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.
 33187	
 33188	âHere are her letters and her portrait,â said he.
 33189	
 33190	He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.
 33191	
 33192	âGive this to the countess... if you see her.â
 33193	
 33194	âShe is very ill,â said Pierre.
 33195	
 33196	âThen she is here still?â said Prince Andrew. âAnd Prince KurÃ¡gin?â he
 33197	added quickly.
 33198	
 33199	âHe left long ago. She has been at deathâs door.â
 33200	
 33201	âI much regret her illness,â said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his
 33202	father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.
 33203	
 33204	âSo Monsieur KurÃ¡gin has not honored Countess RostÃ³va with his hand?â
 33205	said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.
 33206	
 33207	âHe could not marry, for he was married already,â said Pierre.
 33208	
 33209	Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.
 33210	
 33211	âAnd where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?â he said.
 33212	
 33213	âHe has gone to Peters... But I donât know,â said Pierre.
 33214	
 33215	âWell, it doesnât matter,â said Prince Andrew. âTell Countess RostÃ³va
 33216	that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is
 33217	good.â
 33218	
 33219	Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether
 33220	he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say
 33221	anything, looked fixedly at him.
 33222	
 33223	âI say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?â asked Pierre,
 33224	âabout...â
 33225	
 33226	âYes,â returned Prince Andrew hastily. âI said that a fallen woman
 33227	should be forgiven, but I didnât say I could forgive her. I canât.â
 33228	
 33229	âBut can this be compared...?â said Pierre.
 33230	
 33231	Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: âYes, ask her hand
 33232	again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but
 33233	I am unable to follow in that gentlemanâs footsteps. If you wish to be
 33234	my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So
 33235	youâll give her the packet?â
 33236	
 33237	Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.
 33238	
 33239	The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as
 33240	always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her
 33241	satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them
 33242	Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the
 33243	RostÃ³vs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention
 33244	the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.
 33245	
 33246	At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming
 33247	evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with his father,
 33248	now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an unnatural animation,
 33249	the cause of which Pierre so well understood.
 33250	
 33251	
 33252	
 33253	
 33254	
 33255	CHAPTER XXII
 33256	
 33257	That same evening Pierre went to the RostÃ³vsâ to fulfill the commission
 33258	entrusted to him. NatÃ¡sha was in bed, the count at the club, and Pierre,
 33259	after giving the letters to SÃ³nya, went to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna who was
 33260	interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes
 33261	later SÃ³nya came to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
 33262	
 33263	âNatÃ¡sha insists on seeing Count Peter KirÃ­lovich,â said she.
 33264	
 33265	âBut how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been
 33266	tidied up.â
 33267	
 33268	âNo, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,â said SÃ³nya.
 33269	
 33270	MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna only shrugged her shoulders.
 33271	
 33272	âWhen will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind, donât
 33273	tell her everything!â said she to Pierre. âOne hasnât the heart to scold
 33274	her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied.â
 33275	
 33276	NatÃ¡sha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with
 33277	a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find
 33278	her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided
 33279	whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.
 33280	
 33281	Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as
 33282	usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her arms
 33283	hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she
 33284	went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different
 33285	expression of face.
 33286	
 33287	âPeter KirÃ­lovich,â she began rapidly, âPrince BolkÃ³nski was your
 33288	friendâis your friend,â she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that
 33289	everything that had once been must now be different.) âHe told me once
 33290	to apply to you...â
 33291	
 33292	Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then he had
 33293	reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he now felt so
 33294	sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.
 33295	
 33296	âHe is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!â She stopped and
 33297	breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.
 33298	
 33299	âYes... I will tell him,â answered Pierre; âbut...â
 33300	
 33301	He did not know what to say.
 33302	
 33303	NatÃ¡sha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she
 33304	had meant.
 33305	
 33306	âNo, I know all is over,â she said hurriedly. âNo, that can never be.
 33307	Iâm only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only that I
 33308	beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....â
 33309	
 33310	She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.
 33311	
 33312	A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierreâs heart.
 33313	
 33314	âI will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,â said Pierre.
 33315	âBut... I should like to know one thing....â
 33316	
 33317	âKnow what?â NatÃ¡shaâs eyes asked.
 33318	
 33319	âI should like to know, did you love...â Pierre did not know how to
 33320	refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of himââdid you love that
 33321	bad man?â
 33322	
 33323	âDonât call him bad!â said NatÃ¡sha. âBut I donât know, donât know at
 33324	all....â
 33325	
 33326	She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love
 33327	welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and
 33328	hoped they would not be noticed.
 33329	
 33330	âWe wonât speak of it any more, my dear,â said Pierre, and his gentle,
 33331	cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to NatÃ¡sha.
 33332	
 33333	âWe wonât speak of it, my dearâIâll tell him everything; but one thing
 33334	I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help, advice,
 33335	or simply to open your heart to someoneânot now, but when your mind is
 33336	clearer--think of me!â He took her hand and kissed it. âI shall be happy
 33337	if itâs in my power...â
 33338	
 33339	Pierre grew confused.
 33340	
 33341	âDonât speak to me like that. I am not worth it!â exclaimed NatÃ¡sha and
 33342	turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.
 33343	
 33344	He knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it he was
 33345	amazed at his own words.
 33346	
 33347	âStop, stop! You have your whole life before you,â said he to her.
 33348	
 33349	âBefore me? No! All is over for me,â she replied with shame and
 33350	self-abasement.
 33351	
 33352	âAll over?â he repeated. âIf I were not myself, but the handsomest,
 33353	cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this moment
 33354	ask on my knees for your hand and your love!â
 33355	
 33356	For the first time for many days NatÃ¡sha wept tears of gratitude and
 33357	tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.
 33358	
 33359	Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom, restraining
 33360	tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without finding the
 33361	sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh.
 33362	
 33363	âWhere to now, your excellency?â asked the coachman.
 33364	
 33365	âWhere to?â Pierre asked himself. âWhere can I go now? Surely not to the
 33366	Club or to pay calls?â All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison
 33367	with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison
 33368	with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him through her
 33369	tears.
 33370	
 33371	âHome!â said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost Fahrenheit
 33372	he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the
 33373	air with joy.
 33374	
 33375	It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the
 33376	black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky
 33377	did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane
 33378	things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised.
 33379	At the entrance to the ArbÃ¡t Square an immense expanse of dark starry
 33380	sky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the
 33381	PrechÃ­stenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars
 33382	but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white
 33383	light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant
 33384	comet of 1812âthe comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes
 33385	and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long
 33386	luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed
 33387	joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having
 33388	traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable
 33389	space, seemed suddenlyâlike an arrow piercing the earthâto remain
 33390	fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and
 33391	displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars. It
 33392	seemed to Pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in
 33393	his own softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.

 33405	CHAPTER I
 33406	
 33407	From the close of the year 1811 an intensified arming and concentrating of
 33408	the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forcesâmillions
 33409	of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the armyâmoved from the
 33410	west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which since 1811 Russian
 33411	forces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812, the
 33412	forces of Western Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war began,
 33413	that is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human
 33414	nature. Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable
 33415	crimes, frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money,
 33416	burglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not
 33417	recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which
 33418	those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes.
 33419	
 33420	What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The
 33421	historians tell us with naÃ¯ve assurance that its causes were the wrongs
 33422	inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental
 33423	System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the
 33424	mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.
 33425	
 33426	Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,
 33427	RumyÃ¡ntsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have
 33428	taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to
 33429	have written to Alexander: âMy respected Brother, I consent to restore
 33430	the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburgââand there would have been no war.
 33431	
 33432	We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries.
 33433	It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by Englandâs
 33434	intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally
 33435	seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war
 33436	was Napoleonâs ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the
 33437	war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the
 33438	war was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals
 33439	and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of
 33440	giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the
 33441	need of re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of
 33442	that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between
 33443	Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed
 33444	from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It
 33445	is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other
 33446	reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points
 33447	of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to
 33448	posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and
 33449	perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem insufficient.
 33450	To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and
 33451	tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander
 33452	was firm, or because Englandâs policy was astute or the Duke of
 33453	Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances
 33454	have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the
 33455	Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed
 33456	and ruined the people of SmolÃ©nsk and Moscow and were killed by them.
 33457	
 33458	To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried
 33459	away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event
 33460	with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present
 33461	themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of
 33462	them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears
 33463	to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance
 33464	compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotenceâapart
 33465	from the cooperation of all the other coincident causesâto occasion the
 33466	event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to
 33467	serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleonâs refusal to
 33468	withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of
 33469	Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third,
 33470	and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have
 33471	been so many less men in Napoleonâs army and the war could not have
 33472	occurred.
 33473	
 33474	Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
 33475	beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would
 33476	have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second
 33477	term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been
 33478	a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and
 33479	had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic
 33480	government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent
 33481	dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French
 33482	Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have
 33483	happened. So all these causesâmyriads of causesâcoincided to bring it
 33484	about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had
 33485	to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human
 33486	feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows,
 33487	just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east
 33488	to the west, slaying their fellows.
 33489	
 33490	The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed
 33491	to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
 33492	drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be
 33493	otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom
 33494	the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of
 33495	innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event
 33496	could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in
 33497	whose hands lay the real powerâthe soldiers who fired, or transported
 33498	provisions and gunsâshould consent to carry out the will of these weak
 33499	individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number
 33500	of diverse and complex causes.
 33501	
 33502	We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational
 33503	events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of which we do
 33504	not understand). The more we try to explain such events in history
 33505	reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to
 33506	us.
 33507	
 33508	Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal
 33509	aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from
 33510	doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action
 33511	performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to
 33512	history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.
 33513	
 33514	There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which
 33515	is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive
 33516	life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.
 33517	
 33518	Man lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in
 33519	the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done
 33520	is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of
 33521	millions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man
 33522	stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with
 33523	and the more power he has over others, the more evident is the
 33524	predestination and inevitability of his every action.
 33525	
 33526	âThe kingâs heart is in the hands of the Lord.â
 33527	
 33528	A king is historyâs slave.
 33529	
 33530	History, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, uses
 33531	every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.
 33532	
 33533	Though Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever that
 33534	it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses peuples
 33535	*âas Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote himâhe had never
 33536	been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which compelled him, while
 33537	thinking that he was acting on his own volition, to perform for the hive
 33538	lifeâthat is to say, for historyâwhatever had to be performed.
 33539	
 33540	    * âTo shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples.â
 33541	
 33542	
 33543	The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and
 33544	by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and
 33545	co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the
 33546	nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburgâs
 33547	wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussiaâundertaken (as it seemed to
 33548	Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the
 33549	French Emperorâs love and habit of war coinciding with his peopleâs
 33550	inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the
 33551	expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages
 33552	to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received
 33553	in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of
 33554	contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace,
 33555	but which only wounded the self-love of both sides, and millions of
 33556	other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or
 33557	coincided with it.
 33558	
 33559	When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its
 33560	attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried
 33561	by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or
 33562	because the boy standing below wants to eat it?
 33563	
 33564	Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in
 33565	which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist
 33566	who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so
 33567	forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says
 33568	the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it. Equally
 33569	right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he
 33570	wanted to, and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and
 33571	he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because
 33572	the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock. In historic
 33573	events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and
 33574	like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.
 33575	
 33576	Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is
 33577	in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of
 33578	history and predestined from eternity.
 33579	
 33580	
 33581	
 33582	
 33583	
 33584	CHAPTER II
 33585	
 33586	On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent
 33587	three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings,
 33588	and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the
 33589	emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings
 33590	and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds
 33591	of his ownâthat is, which he had taken from other kingsâto the Empress
 33592	of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the
 33593	Empress Marie Louiseâwho regarded him as her husband, though he had left
 33594	another wife in Parisâleft her grieved by the parting which she seemed
 33595	hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in
 33596	the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though
 33597	the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, calling him
 33598	Monsieur mon frÃ¨re, and sincerely assured him that he did not want war
 33599	and would always love and honor himâyet he set off to join his army,
 33600	and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his
 33601	troops from west to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses,
 33602	surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to
 33603	Posen, Thorn, Danzig, and KÃ¶nigsberg. At each of these towns thousands
 33604	of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.
 33605	
 33606	The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried
 33607	him in the same direction. On the tenth of June, * coming up with the
 33608	army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of
 33609	a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.
 33610	
 33611	    * Old style.
 33612	
 33613	Next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the Niemen, and,
 33614	changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to
 33615	select a place for the crossing.
 33616	
 33617	Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the
 33618	wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow
 33619	(Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia
 33620	into which Alexander the Great had marchedâNapoleon unexpectedly, and
 33621	contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an
 33622	advance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.
 33623	
 33624	Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent,
 33625	which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and
 33626	looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of
 33627	the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across
 33628	the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperorâs presence, were on the
 33629	lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat
 33630	and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on
 33631	the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: âVive lâEmpereur!â and
 33632	one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest
 33633	that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three
 33634	bridges to the other side.
 33635	
 33636	âNow weâll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things
 33637	get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive lâEmpereur! So these
 33638	are the steppes of Asia! Itâs a nasty country all the same. Au revoir,
 33639	BeauchÃ©; Iâll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au revoir. Good
 33640	luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive lâEmpereur!... preur!âIf
 33641	they make me Governor of India, GÃ©rard, Iâll make you Minister of
 33642	Kashmirâthatâs settled. Vive lâEmpereur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The
 33643	Cossacksâthose rascalsâsee how they run! Vive lâEmpereur! There he
 33644	is, do you see him? Iâve seen him twice, as I see you now. The little
 33645	corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.... Vive
 33646	lâEmpereur!â came the voices of men, old and young, of most diverse
 33647	characters and social positions. On the faces of all was one common
 33648	expression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and
 33649	of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on
 33650	the hill.
 33651	
 33652	On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was
 33653	brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the
 33654	bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous
 33655	acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
 33656	to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting,
 33657	but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
 33658	distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
 33659	time he joined the army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon
 33660	bridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in
 33661	the direction of KÃ³vno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the
 33662	Guard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for
 33663	him through the troops. On reaching the broad river VÃ­liya, he stopped
 33664	near a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.
 33665	
 33666	âVivat!â shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and
 33667	pressing against one another to see him.
 33668	
 33669	Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log
 33670	that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed
 33671	him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him,
 33672	and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became absorbed in a map laid
 33673	out on the logs. Without lifting his head he said something, and two of
 33674	his aides-de-camp galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.
 33675	
 33676	âWhat? What did he say?â was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans
 33677	when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.
 33678	
 33679	The order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the
 33680	Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech
 33681	from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted
 33682	to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. In evident
 33683	fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he
 33684	begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperorâs
 33685	eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be
 33686	displeased at this excess of zeal.
 33687	
 33688	As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer,
 33689	with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted âVivat!â
 33690	and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped
 33691	into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown
 33692	restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest
 33693	part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after
 33694	him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the
 33695	stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their
 33696	horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others
 33697	tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horsesâ
 33698	manes. They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and,
 33699	though there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they
 33700	were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who
 33701	sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing. When
 33702	the aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment,
 33703	ventured to draw the Emperorâs attention to the devotion of the Poles
 33704	to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having
 33705	summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving
 33706	him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the
 33707	drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.
 33708	
 33709	For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of
 33710	the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to
 33711	dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called for
 33712	his horse and rode to his quarters.
 33713	
 33714	Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to
 33715	their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which
 33716	they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and with
 33717	difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they had
 33718	got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted âVivat!â
 33719	and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he
 33720	no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.
 33721	
 33722	That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper
 33723	money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as
 33724	possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter
 33725	containing information about the orders to the French army had been
 33726	found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who
 33727	had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the LÃ©gion
 33728	dâhonneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.
 33729	
 33730	Quos vult perdere dementat. *
 33731	
 33732	    * Those whom (God) wishes to destroy he drives mad.

 33738	CHAPTER III
 33739	
 33740	The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in VÃ­lna for more than a
 33741	month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for the
 33742	war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come
 33743	from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation
 33744	between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after
 33745	the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each of the three
 33746	armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no supreme
 33747	commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume that
 33748	responsibility himself.
 33749	
 33750	The longer the Emperor remained in VÃ­lna the less did everybodyâtired of
 33751	waitingâprepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded the
 33752	sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly
 33753	and forget that war was impending.
 33754	
 33755	In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the
 33756	courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish
 33757	aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for
 33758	the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received.
 33759	The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by
 33760	subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the
 33761	Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a
 33762	landowner in the VÃ­lna province, offered his country house for the fete,
 33763	and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and
 33764	fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsenâs country seat.
 33765	
 33766	The very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and
 33767	his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian frontier,
 33768	Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his
 33769	aides-de-camp at Bennigsenâs country house.
 33770	
 33771	It was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters declared
 33772	that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place.
 33773	Countess BezÃºkhova was present among other Russian ladies who had
 33774	followed the sovereign from Petersburg to VÃ­lna and eclipsed the refined
 33775	Polish ladies by her massive, so-called Russian type of beauty. The
 33776	Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.
 33777	
 33778	BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the
 33779	present en garÃ§on (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not an
 33780	aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. BorÃ­s
 33781	was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
 33782	patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his
 33783	own age. He was meeting HÃ©lÃ¨ne in VÃ­lna after not having seen her for
 33784	a long time and did not recall the past, but as HÃ©lÃ¨ne was enjoying
 33785	the favors of a very important personage and BorÃ­s had only recently
 33786	married, they met as good friends of long standing.
 33787	
 33788	At midnight dancing was still going on. HÃ©lÃ¨ne, not having a suitable
 33789	partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with BorÃ­s. They were the
 33790	third couple. BorÃ­s, coolly looking at HÃ©lÃ¨neâs dazzling bare shoulders
 33791	which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her
 33792	of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and
 33793	unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor
 33794	who was in the same room. The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the
 33795	doorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which
 33796	he alone knew how to utter.
 33797	
 33798	As the mazurka began, BorÃ­s saw that Adjutant General BalashÃ«v, one of
 33799	those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him and contrary
 33800	to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a Polish
 33801	lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly
 33802	at BalashÃ«v and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because
 33803	there were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady
 33804	and turned to him. Hardly had BalashÃ«v begun to speak before a look of
 33805	amazement appeared on the Emperorâs face. He took BalashÃ«v by the arm
 33806	and crossed the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven
 33807	yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him. BorÃ­s noticed
 33808	ArakchÃ©evâs excited face when the sovereign went out with BalashÃ«v.
 33809	ArakchÃ©ev looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with
 33810	his red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor
 33811	to address him. (BorÃ­s understood that ArakchÃ©ev envied BalashÃ«v and
 33812	was displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor
 33813	otherwise than through himself.)
 33814	
 33815	But the Emperor and BalashÃ«v passed out into the illuminated garden
 33816	without noticing ArakchÃ©ev who, holding his sword and glancing
 33817	wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.
 33818	
 33819	All the time BorÃ­s was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was
 33820	worried by the question of what news BalashÃ«v had brought and how he
 33821	could find it out before others. In the figure in which he had to choose
 33822	two ladies, he whispered to HÃ©lÃ¨ne that he meant to choose Countess
 33823	Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over
 33824	the parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing BalashÃ«v
 33825	and the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were
 33826	moving toward the door. BorÃ­s, fluttering as if he had not had time to
 33827	withdraw, respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.
 33828	
 33829	The Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally
 33830	affronted, was finishing with these words:
 33831	
 33832	âTo enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as long as
 33833	a single armed enemy remains in my country!â It seemed to BorÃ­s that it
 33834	gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was satisfied with
 33835	the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but displeased that
 33836	BorÃ­s had overheard it.
 33837	
 33838	âLet no one know of it!â the Emperor added with a frown.
 33839	
 33840	BorÃ­s understood that this was meant for him and, closing his eyes,
 33841	slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and
 33842	remained there about another half-hour.
 33843	
 33844	BorÃ­s was thus the first to learn the news that the French army had
 33845	crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain
 33846	important personages that much that was concealed from others was
 33847	usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their
 33848	estimation.
 33849	
 33850	
 33851	The unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was
 33852	particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, and at
 33853	a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation
 33854	and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully
 33855	expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On returning home
 33856	at two oâclock that night he sent for his secretary, ShishkÃ³v, and told
 33857	him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal
 33858	Prince SaltykÃ³v, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
 33859	he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on
 33860	Russian soil.
 33861	
 33862	Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:
 33863	
 33864	Monsieur mon frÃ¨re,
 33865	
 33866	Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept
 33867	my engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian
 33868	frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in
 33869	which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that
 33870	Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me
 33871	from the time Prince KurÃ¡kin asked for his passports. The reasons on
 33872	which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would
 33873	never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for
 33874	aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was
 33875	never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of
 33876	it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain
 33877	at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our
 33878	peoples for such a misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your
 33879	troops from Russian territory, I will regard what has passed as not
 33880	having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible. In
 33881	the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself forced to repel an
 33882	attack that nothing on my part has provoked. It still depends on Your
 33883	Majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war.
 33884	
 33885	I am, etc.,
 33886	
 33887	(signed) Alexander
 33888	
 33889	
 33890	
 33891	
 33892	
 33893	CHAPTER IV
 33894	
 33895	At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having
 33896	sent for BalashÃ«v and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him to
 33897	take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When dispatching
 33898	BalashÃ«v, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make
 33899	peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told
 33900	him to transmit those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them
 33901	in his letter to Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt
 33902	it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at
 33903	reconciliation was being made, but he definitely instructed BalashÃ«v to
 33904	repeat them personally to Napoleon.
 33905	
 33906	Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a
 33907	bugler and two Cossacks, BalashÃ«v reached the French outposts at the
 33908	village of RykÃ³nty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn. There he
 33909	was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.
 33910	
 33911	A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a
 33912	shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching BalashÃ«v to halt. BalashÃ«v did
 33913	not do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking
 33914	pace.
 33915	
 33916	The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,
 33917	advanced his horseâs chest against BalashÃ«v, put his hand to his saber,
 33918	and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that
 33919	he did not do as he was told? BalashÃ«v mentioned who he was. The
 33920	noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental
 33921	matters without looking at the Russian general.
 33922	
 33923	After living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after
 33924	conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in general
 33925	being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service, BalashÃ«v
 33926	found it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile,
 33927	and still more this disrespectful, application of brute force to
 33928	himself.
 33929	
 33930	The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air was
 33931	fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from
 33932	the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one after
 33933	another, like bubbles rising in water.
 33934	
 33935	BalashÃ«v looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the
 33936	village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked
 33937	silently at one another from time to time.
 33938	
 33939	A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came
 33940	riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied
 33941	by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked
 33942	smart and well kept.
 33943	
 33944	It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
 33945	trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of
 33946	martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit
 33947	of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.
 33948	
 33949	The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was polite and
 33950	evidently understood BalashÃ«vâs importance. He led him past his soldiers
 33951	and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to
 33952	the Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperorâs
 33953	quarters were, he believed, not far off.
 33954	
 33955	They rode through the village of RykÃ³nty, past tethered French hussar
 33956	horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with
 33957	curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the
 33958	village. The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile
 33959	and a quarter away and would receive BalashÃ«v and conduct him to his
 33960	destination.
 33961	
 33962	The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.
 33963	
 33964	They had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a group
 33965	of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a black horse
 33966	with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes
 33967	in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders. He wore a red
 33968	mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion. This man
 33969	rode toward BalashÃ«v at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and
 33970	gold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.
 33971	
 33972	BalashÃ«v was only two horsesâ length from the equestrian with the
 33973	bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping
 33974	toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the
 33975	French colonel, whispered respectfully: âThe King of Naples!â It was,
 33976	in fact, Murat, now called âKing of Naples.â Though it was quite
 33977	incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so,
 33978	and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more
 33979	solemn and important air than formerly. He was so sure that he really
 33980	was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that
 33981	city, while walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians
 33982	called out to him: âViva il re!â * he turned to his wife with a pensive
 33983	smile and said: âPoor fellows, they donât know that I am leaving them
 33984	tomorrow!â
 33985	
 33986	    * âLong live the king.â
 33987	
 33988	
 33989	But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied
 33990	the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he had
 33991	been ordered to return to military serviceâand especially since his last
 33992	interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august brother-in-law had
 33993	told him: âI made you King that you should reign in my way, but not in
 33994	yours!ââhe had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, andâlike a
 33995	well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows
 33996	skittish between the shaftsâhe dressed up in clothes as variegated and
 33997	expensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the
 33998	roads of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.
 33999	
 34000	On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair
 34001	curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked
 34002	inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully informed His
 34003	Majesty of BalashÃ«vâs mission, whose name he could not pronounce.
 34004	
 34005	âDe Bal-machÃ¨ve!â said the King (overcoming by his assurance the
 34006	difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). âCharmed to
 34007	make your acquaintance, General!â he added, with a gesture of kingly
 34008	condescension.
 34009	
 34010	As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity
 34011	instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his
 34012	natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the
 34013	withers of BalashÃ«vâs horse and said:
 34014	
 34015	âWell, General, it all looks like war,â as if regretting a circumstance
 34016	of which he was unable to judge.
 34017	
 34018	âYour Majesty,â replied BalashÃ«v, âmy master, the Emperor, does not
 34019	desire war and as Your Majesty sees...â said BalashÃ«v, using the words
 34020	Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation unavoidable in
 34021	frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty.
 34022	
 34023	Muratâs face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to âMonsieur
 34024	de Bal-machÃ¨ve.â But royautÃ© oblige! * and he felt it incumbent on
 34025	him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexanderâs
 34026	envoy. He dismounted, took BalashÃ«vâs arm, and moving a few steps away
 34027	from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down
 34028	with him, trying to speak significantly. He referred to the fact that
 34029	the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his
 34030	troops from Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known
 34031	and the dignity of France was thereby offended.
 34032	
 34033	    * âRoyalty has its obligations.â
 34034	
 34035	
 34036	BalashÃ«v replied that there was ânothing offensive in the demand,
 34037	because...â but Murat interrupted him.
 34038	
 34039	âThen you donât consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?â he asked
 34040	unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.
 34041	
 34042	BalashÃ«v told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of the
 34043	war.
 34044	
 34045	âOh, my dear general!â Murat again interrupted him, âwith all my heart I
 34046	wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war
 34047	begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!â said he,
 34048	in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another
 34049	despite a quarrel between their masters.
 34050	
 34051	And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his
 34052	health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent
 34053	with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity,
 34054	Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood
 34055	at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:
 34056	
 34057	âI wonât detain you longer, General. I wish success to your mission,â
 34058	and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his
 34059	glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully
 34060	awaiting him.
 34061	
 34062	BalashÃ«v rode on, supposing from Muratâs words that he would very soon
 34063	be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the next
 34064	village the sentinels of Davoutâs infantry corps detained him as
 34065	the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps
 34066	commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to Marshal
 34067	Davout.

 34071	
 34072	
 34073	CHAPTER V
 34074	
 34075	Davout was to Napoleon what ArakchÃ©ev was to Alexanderâthough not a
 34076	coward like ArakchÃ©ev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to
 34077	express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.
 34078	
 34079	In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are
 34080	necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always
 34081	appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and their
 34082	proximity to the head of the government may be. This inevitability alone
 34083	can explain how the cruel ArakchÃ©ev, who tore out a grenadierâs mustache
 34084	with his own hands, whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face
 34085	danger, and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to
 34086	maintain his powerful position with Alexander, whose own character was
 34087	chivalrous, noble, and gentle.
 34088	
 34089	BalashÃ«v found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasantâs hut,
 34090	writingâhe was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been
 34091	found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put
 34092	themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for
 34093	being gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a
 34094	hurry. âHow can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I
 34095	am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?â the expression of
 34096	his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men,
 34097	when they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own
 34098	dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when
 34099	BalashÃ«v was brought in. He became still more absorbed in his task when
 34100	the Russian general entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at
 34101	BalashÃ«vâs face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and
 34102	by his talk with Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still
 34103	more and sneered malevolently.
 34104	
 34105	When he noticed in BalashÃ«vâs face the disagreeable impression this
 34106	reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he
 34107	wanted.
 34108	
 34109	Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
 34110	Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor
 34111	Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, BalashÃ«v hastened to inform
 34112	him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, after
 34113	hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.
 34114	
 34115	âWhere is your dispatch?â he inquired. âGive it to me. I will send it to
 34116	the Emperor.â
 34117	
 34118	BalashÃ«v replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the
 34119	Emperor.
 34120	
 34121	âYour Emperorâs orders are obeyed in your army, but here,â said Davout,
 34122	âyou must do as youâre told.â
 34123	
 34124	And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his
 34125	dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer
 34126	on duty.
 34127	
 34128	BalashÃ«v took out the packet containing the Emperorâs letter and laid it
 34129	on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid
 34130	across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.
 34131	
 34132	âYou are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,â
 34133	protested BalashÃ«v, âbut permit me to observe that I have the honor to
 34134	be adjutant general to His Majesty....â
 34135	
 34136	Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the
 34137	signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on BalashÃ«vâs face.
 34138	
 34139	âYou will be treated as is fitting,â said he and, putting the packet in
 34140	his pocket, left the shed.
 34141	
 34142	A minute later the marshalâs adjutant, de CastrÃ¨s, came in and conducted
 34143	BalashÃ«v to the quarters assigned him.
 34144	
 34145	That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the barrels.
 34146	
 34147	Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking BalashÃ«v to come to
 34148	him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the
 34149	baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one
 34150	except Monsieur de CastrÃ¨s.
 34151	
 34152	After four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his impotence
 34153	and insignificanceâparticularly acute by contrast with the sphere of
 34154	power in which he had so lately movedâand after several marches with
 34155	the marshalâs baggage and the French army, which occupied the
 34156	whole district, BalashÃ«v was brought to VÃ­lnaânow occupied by the
 34157	Frenchâthrough the very gate by which he had left it four days
 34158	previously.
 34159	
 34160	Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came
 34161	to BalashÃ«v and informed him of the Emperor Napoleonâs wish to honor him
 34162	with an audience.
 34163	
 34164	Four days before, sentinels of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment had stood in
 34165	front of the house to which BalashÃ«v was conducted, and now two French
 34166	grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with
 34167	shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a
 34168	brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting
 34169	for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle
 34170	horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received BalashÃ«v in the very
 34171	house in VÃ­lna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission.
 34172	
 34173	
 34174	
 34175	
 34176	
 34177	CHAPTER VI
 34178	
 34179	Though BalashÃ«v was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury
 34180	and magnificence of Napoleonâs court.
 34181	
 34182	The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many
 34183	generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnatesâseveral of whom
 34184	BalashÃ«v had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russiaâwere waiting.
 34185	Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going
 34186	for his ride.
 34187	
 34188	After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into
 34189	the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked BalashÃ«v to follow
 34190	him.
 34191	
 34192	BalashÃ«v went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a
 34193	study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him
 34194	on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried
 34195	footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all
 34196	was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps,
 34197	firm and resoluteâthey were those of Napoleon. He had just finished
 34198	dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over
 34199	a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white
 34200	leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and
 34201	Hessian boots. His short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one
 34202	lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck
 34203	stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled
 34204	of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, with its
 34205	prominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial
 34206	welcome.
 34207	
 34208	He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly
 34209	thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick
 34210	shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that
 34211	imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in
 34212	comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits that
 34213	day.
 34214	
 34215	He nodded in answer to BalashÃ«vâs low and respectful bow, and coming up
 34216	to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his
 34217	time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure
 34218	he will always say the right thing and say it well.
 34219	
 34220	âGood day, General!â said he. âI have received the letter you brought
 34221	from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.â He glanced with
 34222	his large eyes into BalashÃ«vâs face and immediately looked past him.
 34223	
 34224	It was plain that BalashÃ«vâs personality did not interest him at all.
 34225	Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him.
 34226	Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because everything
 34227	in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his will.
 34228	
 34229	âI do not, and did not, desire war,â he continued, âbut it has been
 34230	forced on me. Even nowâ (he emphasized the word) âI am ready to receive
 34231	any explanations you can give me.â
 34232	
 34233	And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
 34234	dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly
 34235	moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, BalashÃ«v
 34236	was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into
 34237	negotiations.
 34238	
 34239	When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the
 34240	Russian envoy, BalashÃ«v began a speech he had prepared long before:
 34241	âSire! The Emperor, my master...â but the sight of the Emperorâs eyes
 34242	bent on him confused him. âYou are flurriedâcompose yourself!â Napoleon
 34243	seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at
 34244	BalashÃ«vâs uniform and sword.
 34245	
 34246	BalashÃ«v recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the
 34247	Emperor Alexander did not consider KurÃ¡kinâs demand for his passports a
 34248	sufficient cause for war; that KurÃ¡kin had acted on his own initiative
 34249	and without his sovereignâs assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not
 34250	desire war, and had no relations with England.
 34251	
 34252	âNot yet!â interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his
 34253	feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that BalashÃ«v might
 34254	proceed.
 34255	
 34256	After saying all he had been instructed to say, BalashÃ«v added that
 34257	the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into
 34258	negotiations except on condition that... Here BalashÃ«v hesitated:
 34259	he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his
 34260	letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to SaltykÃ³v and had
 34261	told BalashÃ«v to repeat to Napoleon. BalashÃ«v remembered these words,
 34262	âSo long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,â but some
 34263	complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though he
 34264	wished to do so. He grew confused and said: âOn condition that the
 34265	French army retires beyond the Niemen.â
 34266	
 34267	Napoleon noticed BalashÃ«vâs embarrassment when uttering these last
 34268	words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver
 34269	rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in
 34270	a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that
 34271	followed, BalashÃ«v, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily
 34272	noticed the quivering of Napoleonâs left leg which increased the more
 34273	Napoleon raised his voice.
 34274	
 34275	âI desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,â he began. âHave
 34276	I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I
 34277	have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin
 34278	negotiations, what is demanded of me?â he said, frowning and making an
 34279	energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.
 34280	
 34281	âThe withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,â replied BalashÃ«v.
 34282	
 34283	âThe Niemen?â repeated Napoleon. âSo now you want me to retire beyond
 34284	the Niemenâonly the Niemen?â repeated Napoleon, looking straight at
 34285	BalashÃ«v.
 34286	
 34287	The latter bowed his head respectfully.
 34288	
 34289	Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania,
 34290	only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned
 34291	quickly and began to pace the room.
 34292	
 34293	âYou say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen
 34294	before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago
 34295	the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder,
 34296	and yet you are willing to negotiate.â
 34297	
 34298	He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again
 34299	stopped in front of BalashÃ«v. BalashÃ«v noticed that his left leg was
 34300	quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern
 34301	expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was
 34302	conscious of. âThe vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,â
 34303	he remarked at a later date.
 34304	
 34305	âSuch demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a
 34306	Prince of Baden, but not to me!â Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his
 34307	own surprise. âIf you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept
 34308	such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his
 34309	army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I
 34310	have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when
 34311	your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the
 34312	aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?â he continued
 34313	hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace
 34314	and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and
 34315	power and Alexanderâs errors and duplicity.
 34316	
 34317	The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the
 34318	intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing
 34319	that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking,
 34320	and the more he talked the less could he control his words.
 34321	
 34322	The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and
 34323	insult Alexanderâjust what he had least desired at the commencement of
 34324	the interview.
 34325	
 34326	âI hear you have made peace with Turkey?â
 34327	
 34328	BalashÃ«v bowed his head affirmatively.
 34329	
 34330	âPeace has been concluded...â he began.
 34331	
 34332	But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the
 34333	talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and
 34334	unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.
 34335	
 34336	âYes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining
 34337	Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those
 34338	provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,â he went on, âI promised and would
 34339	have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he
 34340	wonât have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to
 34341	his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the
 34342	Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could
 34343	not have done more,â said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he
 34344	paced up and down the room, repeating to BalashÃ«v almost the very words
 34345	he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. âAll that, he would have
 34346	owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!â he repeated several
 34347	times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to
 34348	his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.
 34349	
 34350	âWhat a splendid reign the Emperor Alexanderâs might have been!â
 34351	
 34352	He looked compassionately at BalashÃ«v, and as soon as the latter tried
 34353	to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.
 34354	
 34355	âWhat could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained
 34356	through my friendship?â demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders
 34357	in perplexity. âBut no, he has preferred to surround himself with
 34358	my enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and
 34359	Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;
 34360	Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French
 34361	subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all
 34362	the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who
 34363	should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexanderâs mind....
 34364	Granted that were they competent they might be made use of,â continued
 34365	Napoleonâhardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts
 34366	that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his
 34367	perception the two were one and the same)ââbut they are not even that!
 34368	They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the
 34369	most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first
 34370	movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes,
 34371	Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act,
 34372	does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result.
 34373	BagratiÃ³n alone is a military man. Heâs stupid, but he has experience,
 34374	a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your young monarch
 34375	playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him
 34376	the responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign should not be with
 34377	the army unless he is a general!â said Napoleon, evidently uttering
 34378	these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander
 34379	desired to be a military commander.
 34380	
 34381	âThe campaign began only a week ago, and you havenât even been able to
 34382	defend VÃ­lna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish
 34383	provinces. Your army is grumbling.â
 34384	
 34385	âOn the contrary, Your Majesty,â said BalashÃ«v, hardly able to remember
 34386	what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with
 34387	difficulty, âthe troops are burning with eagerness...â
 34388	
 34389	âI know everything!â Napoleon interrupted him. âI know everything. I
 34390	know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have
 34391	not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give
 34392	you my word of honor,â said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor
 34393	could carry no weightââI give you my word of honor that I have five
 34394	hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will
 34395	be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making
 34396	peace with you. As for the Swedesâit is their fate to be governed by
 34397	mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for
 34398	anotherâBernadotte, who promptly went madâfor no Swede would ally
 34399	himself with Russia unless he were mad.â
 34400	
 34401	Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.
 34402	
 34403	BalashÃ«v knew how to reply to each of Napoleonâs remarks, and would
 34404	have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say
 34405	something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity
 34406	of the Swedes, BalashÃ«v wished to reply that when Russia is on her side
 34407	Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation
 34408	to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which
 34409	a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is
 34410	in the right. BalashÃ«v began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared
 34411	to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man,
 34412	he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently
 34413	seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon
 34414	had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them
 34415	when he came to his senses. BalashÃ«v stood with downcast eyes, looking
 34416	at the movements of Napoleonâs stout legs and trying to avoid meeting
 34417	his eyes.
 34418	
 34419	âBut what do I care about your allies?â said Napoleon. âI have
 34420	alliesâthe Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like
 34421	lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.â
 34422	
 34423	And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this
 34424	obvious falsehood, and that BalashÃ«v still stood silently before him in
 34425	the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned
 34426	round, drew close to BalashÃ«vâs face, and, gesticulating rapidly and
 34427	energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:
 34428	
 34429	âKnow that if you stir up Prussia against me, Iâll wipe it off the map
 34430	of Europe!â he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he
 34431	struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. âYes, I
 34432	will throw you back beyond the DvÃ­na and beyond the Dnieper, and will
 34433	re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of
 34434	Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you.
 34435	That is what you have gained by alienating me!â And he walked silently
 34436	several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.
 34437	
 34438	He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted
 34439	it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of BalashÃ«v. He
 34440	paused, looked ironically straight into BalashÃ«vâs eyes, and said in a
 34441	quiet voice:
 34442	
 34443	âAnd yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!â
 34444	
 34445	BalashÃ«v, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the
 34446	Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was
 34447	silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to
 34448	him. BalashÃ«v said that in Russia the best results were expected from
 34449	the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, âI know itâs
 34450	your duty to say that, but you donât believe it yourself. I have
 34451	convinced you.â
 34452	
 34453	When BalashÃ«v had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed
 34454	at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door
 34455	opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor
 34456	his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon,
 34457	without giving them a glance, turned to BalashÃ«v:
 34458	
 34459	âAssure the Emperor Alexander from me,â said he, taking his hat, âthat
 34460	I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly
 34461	esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you
 34462	shall receive my letter to the Emperor.â
 34463	
 34464	And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room
 34465	rushed forward and descended the staircase.
 34466	
 34467	
 34468	
 34469	
 34470	
 34471	CHAPTER VII
 34472	
 34473	After all that Napoleon had said to himâthose bursts of anger and the
 34474	last dryly spoken words: âI will detain you no longer, General; you
 34475	shall receive my letter,â BalashÃ«v felt convinced that Napoleon would
 34476	not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with himâan
 34477	insulted envoyâespecially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But,
 34478	to his surprise, BalashÃ«v received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine
 34479	with the Emperor that day.
 34480	
 34481	BessiÃ¨res, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.
 34482	
 34483	Napoleon met BalashÃ«v cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign
 34484	of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,
 34485	but, on the contrary, tried to reassure BalashÃ«v. It was evident that
 34486	he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a
 34487	mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not
 34488	because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he
 34489	did it.
 34490	
 34491	The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through VÃ­lna, where
 34492	crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all
 34493	the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his
 34494	monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved
 34495	their handkerchiefs to him.
 34496	
 34497	At dinner, having placed BalashÃ«v beside him, Napoleon not only treated
 34498	him amiably but behaved as if BalashÃ«v were one of his own courtiers,
 34499	one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at
 34500	his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and
 34501	questioned BalashÃ«v about the Russian capital, not merely as an
 34502	interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as
 34503	if convinced that BalashÃ«v, as a Russian, must be flattered by his
 34504	curiosity.
 34505	
 34506	âHow many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true
 34507	that Moscow is called âHoly Moscowâ? How many churches are there in
 34508	Moscow?â he asked.
 34509	
 34510	And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches,
 34511	he remarked:
 34512	
 34513	âWhy such a quantity of churches?â
 34514	
 34515	âThe Russians are very devout,â replied BalashÃ«v.
 34516	
 34517	âBut a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the
 34518	backwardness of a people,â said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for
 34519	appreciation of this remark.
 34520	
 34521	BalashÃ«v respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.
 34522	
 34523	âEvery country has its own character,â said he.
 34524	
 34525	âBut nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,â said Napoleon.
 34526	
 34527	âI beg your Majestyâs pardon,â returned BalashÃ«v, âbesides Russia there
 34528	is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.â
 34529	
 34530	This reply of BalashÃ«vâs, which hinted at the recent defeats of the
 34531	French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexanderâs
 34532	court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleonâs dinner, where it
 34533	passed unnoticed.
 34534	
 34535	The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they
 34536	were puzzled as to what BalashÃ«vâs tone suggested. âIf there is a point
 34537	we donât see it, or it is not at all witty,â their expressions seemed
 34538	to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not
 34539	notice it at all and naÃ¯vely asked BalashÃ«v through what towns the
 34540	direct road from there to Moscow passed. BalashÃ«v, who was on the alert
 34541	all through the dinner, replied that just as âall roads lead to Rome,â
 34542	so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and âamong them the
 34543	road through PoltÃ¡va, which Charles XII chose.â BalashÃ«v involuntarily
 34544	flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had
 34545	he uttered the word PoltÃ¡va before Caulaincourt began speaking of the
 34546	badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg
 34547	reminiscences.
 34548	
 34549	After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleonâs study, which four
 34550	days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat
 34551	down, toying with his SÃ¨vres coffee cup, and motioned BalashÃ«v to a
 34552	chair beside him.
 34553	
 34554	Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than
 34555	any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to
 34556	consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded
 34557	by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner,
 34558	BalashÃ«v too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a
 34559	pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.
 34560	
 34561	âThey tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange,
 34562	isnât it, General?â he said, evidently not doubting that this remark
 34563	would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleonâs,
 34564	superiority to Alexander.
 34565	
 34566	BalashÃ«v made no reply and bowed his head in silence.
 34567	
 34568	âYes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were
 34569	deliberating,â continued Napoleon with the same derisive and
 34570	self-confident smile. âWhat I canât understand,â he went on, âis that
 34571	the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies.
 34572	That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?â
 34573	and he turned inquiringly to BalashÃ«v, and evidently this thought turned
 34574	him back on to the track of his morningâs anger, which was still fresh
 34575	in him.
 34576	
 34577	âAnd let him know that I will do so!â said Napoleon, rising and pushing
 34578	his cup away with his hand. âIâll drive all his WÃ¼rttemberg, Baden, and
 34579	Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. Iâll drive them out. Let him
 34580	prepare an asylum for them in Russia!â
 34581	
 34582	BalashÃ«v bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to
 34583	make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help
 34584	hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;
 34585	he treated BalashÃ«v not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man
 34586	now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former masterâs
 34587	humiliation.
 34588	
 34589	âAnd why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What is
 34590	the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to reign
 34591	and not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a
 34592	responsibility?â
 34593	
 34594	Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and down
 34595	the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to
 34596	BalashÃ«v and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly, and simply
 34597	as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to
 34598	BalashÃ«v, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian generalâs
 34599	face and, taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips
 34600	only.
 34601	
 34602	To have oneâs ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest
 34603	honor and mark of favor at the French court.
 34604	
 34605	âWell, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why donât you say
 34606	anything?â said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the
 34607	adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. âAre the horses
 34608	ready for the general?â he added, with a slight inclination of his head
 34609	in reply to BalashÃ«vâs bow. âLet him have mine, he has a long way to
 34610	go!â
 34611	
 34612	The letter taken by BalashÃ«v was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander.
 34613	Every detail of the interview was communicated to the Russian monarch,
 34614	and the war began....
 34615	
 34616	
 34617	
 34618	
 34619	
 34620	CHAPTER VIII
 34621	
 34622	After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to
 34623	Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet
 34624	Anatole KurÃ¡gin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching
 34625	Petersburg he inquired for KurÃ¡gin but the latter had already left the
 34626	city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on
 34627	his track. Anatole KurÃ¡gin promptly obtained an appointment from
 34628	the Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in
 34629	Petersburg Prince Andrew met KutÃºzov, his former commander who was
 34630	always well disposed toward him, and KutÃºzov suggested that he should
 34631	accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general had
 34632	been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an
 34633	appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.
 34634	
 34635	Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge KurÃ¡gin.
 34636	He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might
 34637	compromise the young Countess RostÃ³va and so he wanted to meet KurÃ¡gin
 34638	personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again
 34639	failed to meet KurÃ¡gin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived,
 34640	the latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions,
 34641	Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken
 34642	faith with himâwhich he felt the more acutely the more he tried to
 34643	conceal its effectsâthe surroundings in which he had been happy became
 34644	trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized
 34645	so highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the
 34646	thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the
 34647	field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which
 34648	had filled his solitude at BoguchÃ¡rovo and then in Switzerland and Rome,
 34649	but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons
 34650	they had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical
 34651	matters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more
 34652	eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if
 34653	that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him
 34654	had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in
 34655	which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.
 34656	
 34657	Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the
 34658	simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on KutÃºzovâs staff,
 34659	he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised
 34660	KutÃºzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found
 34661	KurÃ¡gin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back
 34662	to Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might
 34663	be before he met KurÃ¡gin, despite his contempt for him and despite all
 34664	the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping
 34665	to a conflict with himâhe knew that when he did meet him he would not
 34666	be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help
 34667	snatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet
 34668	avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and
 34669	poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in
 34670	Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and
 34671	ambitious activity.
 34672	
 34673	In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached
 34674	Bucharestâwhere KutÃºzov had been living for two months, passing his
 34675	days and nights with a Wallachian womanâPrince Andrew asked KutÃºzov
 34676	to transfer him to the Western Army. KutÃºzov, who was already weary of
 34677	BolkÃ³nskiâs activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very
 34678	readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.
 34679	
 34680	Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at
 34681	Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way,
 34682	being only two miles off the SmolÃ©nsk highroad. During the last three
 34683	years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt,
 34684	and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that
 34685	on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find
 34686	the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail.
 34687	He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up
 34688	the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted,
 34689	sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the
 34690	same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture,
 34691	the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only
 34692	somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden
 34693	getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of
 34694	her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was
 34695	the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her
 34696	existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become
 34697	more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had
 34698	brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and
 34699	talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly
 34700	intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince
 34701	had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a
 34702	noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as
 34703	ever, only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was
 34704	happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed. He had grown,
 34705	become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite
 34706	unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just
 34707	as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of
 34708	immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though externally
 34709	all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had
 34710	changed since Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was
 34711	divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for
 34712	his sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged
 34713	the old prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other
 34714	Princess Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and
 34715	maids.
 34716	
 34717	During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they
 34718	were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose
 34719	sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all
 34720	feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he
 34721	was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb
 34722	and retired to his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening,
 34723	when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to
 34724	tell him of the young Count KÃ¡menskyâs campaign, the old prince
 34725	began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her
 34726	superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said,
 34727	was the only person really attached to him.
 34728	
 34729	The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess
 34730	Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by
 34731	indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The
 34732	old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her
 34733	life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting
 34734	her and that she deserved it. âWhy does Prince Andrew, who sees this,
 34735	say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an
 34736	old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance
 34737	and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesnât understand, so I
 34738	must explain it, and he must hear me out,â thought the old prince.
 34739	And he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughterâs
 34740	unreasonable character.
 34741	
 34742	âIf you ask me,â said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was
 34743	censuring his father for the first time in his life), âI did not wish to
 34744	speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If
 34745	there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I canât
 34746	blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and respects you. Since
 34747	you ask me,â continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritableâas he was
 34748	always liable to do of lateââI can only say that if there are any
 34749	misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who is not
 34750	fit to be my sisterâs companion.â
 34751	
 34752	The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile
 34753	disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could
 34754	not get accustomed.
 34755	
 34756	âWhat companion, my dear boy? Eh? Youâve already been talking it over!
 34757	Eh?â
 34758	
 34759	âFather, I did not want to judge,â said Prince Andrew, in a hard and
 34760	bitter tone, âbut you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall
 34761	say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blameâthe one to blameâis
 34762	that Frenchwoman.â
 34763	
 34764	âAh, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!â said the old man in a
 34765	low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment,
 34766	but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: âBe off, be off! Let not a
 34767	trace of you remain here!...â
 34768	
 34769	
 34770	Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him
 34771	to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not
 34772	leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and
 34773	TÃ­khon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day,
 34774	before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his sonâs rooms. The boy,
 34775	curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,
 34776	and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell
 34777	into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this
 34778	pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He
 34779	sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret
 34780	at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him,
 34781	and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that
 34782	he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son
 34783	which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on
 34784	his knee.
 34785	
 34786	âWell, go on!â said his son.
 34787	
 34788	Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out
 34789	of the room.
 34790	
 34791	As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and
 34792	especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had
 34793	been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity,
 34794	and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as
 34795	soon as possible.
 34796	
 34797	âSo youâve decided to go, Andrew?â asked his sister.
 34798	
 34799	âThank God that I can,â replied Prince Andrew. âI am very sorry you
 34800	canât.â
 34801	
 34802	âWhy do you say that?â replied Princess Mary. âWhy do you say that,
 34803	when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle
 34804	Bourienne says he has been asking about you....â
 34805	
 34806	As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears
 34807	began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.
 34808	
 34809	âAh, my God! my God! When one thinks who and whatâwhat trashâcan cause
 34810	people misery!â he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.
 34811	
 34812	She understood that when speaking of âtrashâ he referred not only to
 34813	Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who
 34814	had ruined his own happiness.
 34815	
 34816	âAndrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!â she said, touching his
 34817	elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. âI
 34818	understand youâ (she looked down). âDonât imagine that sorrow is the
 34819	work of men. Men are His tools.â She looked a little above Prince
 34820	Andrewâs head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks
 34821	at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. âSorrow is sent by Him,
 34822	not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame. If you think
 34823	someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have no right to
 34824	punish. And then you will know the happiness of forgiving.â
 34825	
 34826	âIf I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a womanâs virtue. But
 34827	a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,â he replied, and though
 34828	till that moment he had not been thinking of KurÃ¡gin, all his unexpended
 34829	anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.
 34830	
 34831	âIf Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long
 34832	ago to have punished him,â he thought. And giving her no further reply,
 34833	he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet
 34834	KurÃ¡gin who he knew was now in the army.
 34835	
 34836	Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how
 34837	unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to
 34838	him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again
 34839	from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the
 34840	longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.
 34841	
 34842	âGood-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men are
 34843	never to blame,â were the last words he heard from his sister when he
 34844	took leave of her.
 34845	
 34846	âThen it must be so!â thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the
 34847	avenue from the house at Bald Hills. âShe, poor innocent creature, is
 34848	left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old
 34849	man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up
 34850	and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be
 34851	deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself donât know. I want
 34852	to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and
 34853	laugh at me!â
 34854	
 34855	These conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were
 34856	all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless
 34857	things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to
 34858	Prince Andrewâs mind.
 34859	
 34860	
 34861	
 34862	
 34863	
 34864	CHAPTER IX
 34865	
 34866	Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of
 34867	June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified
 34868	camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a
 34869	junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by
 34870	large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course
 34871	of affairs in the Russian army, but no one anticipated any danger of
 34872	invasion of the Russian provinces, and no one thought the war would
 34873	extend farther than the western, the Polish, provinces.
 34874	
 34875	Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on
 34876	the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large
 34877	village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and
 34878	courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the
 34879	villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay
 34880	de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received
 34881	BolkÃ³nski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he
 34882	would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment,
 34883	but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole KurÃ¡gin, whom
 34884	Prince Andrew had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had
 34885	gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind
 34886	was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting
 34887	a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the
 34888	distraction caused by the thought of KurÃ¡gin. During the first four
 34889	days, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrew rode round the
 34890	whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own knowledge and by
 34891	talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about it. But the
 34892	question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained
 34893	for him undecided. Already from his military experience and what he had
 34894	seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in
 34895	war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all
 34896	depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemyâthat cannot be
 34897	foreseenâare met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled.
 34898	To clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his
 34899	position and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control
 34900	of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for
 34901	himself the following of the state of affairs.
 34902	
 34903	While the Emperor had still been at VÃ­lna, the forces had been divided
 34904	into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the
 34905	army under BagratiÃ³n, and thirdly, the one commanded by TormÃ¡sov. The
 34906	Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the
 34907	orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command,
 34908	but only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had
 34909	with him not a commander in chiefâs staff but the imperial headquarters
 34910	staff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff,
 34911	Quartermaster General Prince VolkÃ³nski, as well as generals, imperial
 34912	aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners,
 34913	but not the army staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the
 34914	Emperor without any definite appointments: ArakchÃ©ev, the ex-Minister
 34915	of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand Duke
 34916	TsarÃ©vich Constantine PÃ¡vlovich; Count RumyÃ¡ntsev, the Chancellor;
 34917	Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel,
 34918	the chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general
 34919	and Sardinian Ã©migrÃ©; Wolzogenâand many others. Though these men had no
 34920	military appointment in the army, their position gave them influence,
 34921	and often a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not
 34922	know in what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke,
 34923	ArakchÃ©ev, or Prince VolkÃ³nski, or was given this or that advice and did
 34924	not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated
 34925	from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be
 34926	executed or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential
 34927	significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people,
 34928	from a courtierâs point of view (and in an Emperorâs vicinity all became
 34929	courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not
 34930	assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies;
 34931	the men around him were his assistants. ArakchÃ©ev was a faithful
 34932	custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereignâs bodyguard.
 34933	Bennigsen was a landlord in the VÃ­lna province who appeared to be doing
 34934	the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful
 34935	as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke
 34936	was there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there
 34937	because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high
 34938	esteem personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general
 34939	full of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.
 34940	Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The
 34941	adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the
 34942	Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up
 34943	the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to
 34944	believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business
 34945	of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuelâs thoughts in
 34946	a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish
 34947	theorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was
 34948	able to do.
 34949	
 34950	Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected
 34951	ideas every dayâespecially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness
 34952	characteristic of people employed in a country not their ownâthere were
 34953	many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals
 34954	were there.
 34955	
 34956	Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant,
 34957	and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined
 34958	subdivisions of tendencies and parties:
 34959	
 34960	The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherentsâmilitary theorists
 34961	who believed in a science of war with immutable lawsâlaws of oblique
 34962	movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded
 34963	a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise
 34964	laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism,
 34965	ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To
 34966	this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and
 34967	others, chiefly Germans.
 34968	
 34969	The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as
 34970	always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of
 34971	this party were those who had demanded an advance from VÃ­lna into Poland
 34972	and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold
 34973	action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still
 34974	more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: BagratiÃ³n, ErmÃ³lov
 34975	(who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a
 34976	famous joke of ErmÃ³lovâs was being circulated, that as a great favor he
 34977	had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party,
 34978	remembering SuvÃ³rov, said that what one had to do was not to reason,
 34979	or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of
 34980	Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.
 34981	
 34982	To the third partyâin which the Emperor had most confidenceâbelonged the
 34983	courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The
 34984	members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom ArakchÃ©ev belonged,
 34985	thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to
 34986	have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly
 34987	against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now),
 34988	needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and
 34989	in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be
 34990	acknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one
 34991	should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuelâs
 34992	opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and
 34993	then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp
 34994	at Drissa, according to Pfuelâs plan, but on changing the movements of
 34995	the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other
 34996	could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third
 34997	party.
 34998	
 34999	Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
 35000	TsarÃ©vich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where
 35001	he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry
 35002	uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but
 35003	unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid
 35004	the general confusion. The men of this party had both the quality
 35005	and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon,
 35006	recognized his strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so.
 35007	They said: âNothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this!
 35008	We have abandoned VÃ­lna and VÃ­tebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only
 35009	reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible,
 35010	before we are turned out of Petersburg.â
 35011	
 35012	This view was very general in the upper army circles and found support
 35013	also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, RumyÃ¡ntsev, who, for other
 35014	reasons of state, was in favor of peace.
 35015	
 35016	The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de
 35017	Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in
 35018	chief. âBe he what he mayâ (they always began like that), âhe is an
 35019	honest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real power,
 35020	for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command, and
 35021	he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well
 35022	organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering
 35023	any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to
 35024	be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his
 35025	incapacity already in 1807.â
 35026	
 35027	The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any
 35028	rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: âand
 35029	twist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually.
 35030	Let the others make mistakes now!â said they, arguing that our
 35031	retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series
 35032	of blunders. âThe more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any
 35033	rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this.
 35034	What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen,
 35035	who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justiceâa
 35036	man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the
 35037	only such man.â
 35038	
 35039	The seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to
 35040	be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were
 35041	particularly many round Alexanderâgenerals and imperial aides-de-camp
 35042	passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a
 35043	man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as RostÃ³v had done
 35044	in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human
 35045	capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign
 35046	for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive
 35047	modesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign
 35048	should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place
 35049	himself at the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chiefâs
 35050	staff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where
 35051	necessary, would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be
 35052	raised to the highest pitch.
 35053	
 35054	The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the
 35055	others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither
 35056	peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa
 35057	or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor
 35058	Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thingâas much advantage
 35059	and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of
 35060	conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperorâs
 35061	headquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at
 35062	other times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would
 35063	today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after,
 35064	merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare
 35065	that he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to
 35066	gain some advantage would attract the Emperorâs attention by loudly
 35067	advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day before,
 35068	and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast and
 35069	challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby proving
 35070	that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good. A third,
 35071	in the absence of opponents, between two councils would simply solicit
 35072	a special gratuity for his faithful services, well knowing that at that
 35073	moment people would be too busy to refuse him. A fourth while seemingly
 35074	overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the Emperorâs
 35075	eye. A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the
 35076	Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some
 35077	newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more
 35078	or less forcible and correct.
 35079	
 35080	All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and
 35081	promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial
 35082	favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole
 35083	drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it
 35084	was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the
 35085	uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving
 35086	a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of
 35087	intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity
 35088	of race among these peopleâthis eighth and largest party of those
 35089	preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and
 35090	obscurity to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these
 35091	drones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew
 35092	over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of
 35093	those who were disputing honestly.
 35094	
 35095	From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached
 35096	the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning
 35097	to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men
 35098	experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of
 35099	those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what
 35100	was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of
 35101	escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.
 35102	
 35103	The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted
 35104	chiefly from the Emperorâs presence in the army with his military court
 35105	and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional,
 35106	and unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but
 35107	harmful in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the
 35108	army, and that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor
 35109	and his court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor
 35110	paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his
 35111	personal safety, and that the worst commander in chief, if independent,
 35112	would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and
 35113	authority of the monarch.
 35114	
 35115	Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,
 35116	ShishkÃ³v, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of
 35117	this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which ArakchÃ©ev and BalashÃ«v
 35118	agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him
 35119	by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully
 35120	suggestedâon the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse
 35121	a warlike spirit in the people of the capitalâthat the Emperor should
 35122	leave the army.
 35123	
 35124	That arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to
 35125	defend their countryâthe very incitement which was the chief cause of
 35126	Russiaâs triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsarâs personal
 35127	presence in Moscowâwas suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by him, as
 35128	a pretext for quitting the army.
 35129	
 35130	
 35131	
 35132	
 35133	
 35134	CHAPTER X
 35135	
 35136	This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one
 35137	day at dinner, informed BolkÃ³nski that the sovereign wished to see him
 35138	personally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to
 35139	present himself at Bennigsenâs quarters at six that evening.
 35140	
 35141	News was received at the Emperorâs quarters that very day of a fresh
 35142	movement by Napoleon which might endanger the armyânews subsequently
 35143	found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the
 35144	Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that
 35145	this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered
 35146	a chef-dâoeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleonâs
 35147	destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the
 35148	Russian army.
 35149	
 35150	Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsenâs quartersâa country gentlemanâs
 35151	house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither
 35152	Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but ChernÃ½shev, the Emperorâs
 35153	aide-de-camp, received BolkÃ³nski and informed him that the Emperor,
 35154	accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second
 35155	time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the
 35156	suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.
 35157	
 35158	ChernÃ½shev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel
 35159	in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still
 35160	an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood
 35161	the folding bedstead of Bennigsenâs adjutant. This adjutant was also
 35162	there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by
 35163	work or by feasting. Two doors led from the room, one straight on into
 35164	what had been the drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study.
 35165	Through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in German
 35166	and occasionally in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by
 35167	the Emperorâs wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred
 35168	indefiniteness), but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in
 35169	view of the impending difficulties. It was not a council of war, but,
 35170	as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor
 35171	personally. To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General
 35172	Armfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had
 35173	referred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein
 35174	who was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince
 35175	Andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew
 35176	had an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon
 35177	after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a
 35178	minute to speak to ChernÃ½shev.
 35179	
 35180	At first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general,
 35181	which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince
 35182	Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about
 35183	him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German
 35184	theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more
 35185	typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German
 35186	theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to
 35187	such an extent.
 35188	
 35189	Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build,
 35190	broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was
 35191	much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily
 35192	brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint
 35193	little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and angrily
 35194	around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment. Awkwardly
 35195	holding up his sword, he addressed ChernÃ½shev and asked in German where
 35196	the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass through the rooms
 35197	as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down
 35198	to business in front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded
 35199	hurriedly in reply to ChernÃ½shev, and smiled ironically on hearing that
 35200	the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had
 35201	planned in accord with his theory. He muttered something to himself
 35202	abruptly and in a bass voice, as self-assured Germans doâit might
 35203	have been âstupid fellowâ... or âthe whole affair will be ruined,â or
 35204	âsomething absurd will come of it.â... Prince Andrew did not catch
 35205	what he said and would have passed on, but ChernÃ½shev introduced him to
 35206	Pfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the
 35207	war had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel barely glancedânot so much at
 35208	Prince Andrew as past himâand said, with a laugh: âThat must have been a
 35209	fine tactical warâ; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room
 35210	from which the sound of voices was heard.
 35211	
 35212	Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly
 35213	disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect
 35214	and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with
 35215	Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to
 35216	form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly
 35217	and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of
 35218	martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident
 35219	on the basis of an abstract notionâscience, that is, the supposed
 35220	knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he
 35221	regards himself personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly
 35222	attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a
 35223	citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an
 35224	Englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as
 35225	an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because
 35226	he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian
 35227	is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know
 35228	anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The
 35229	Germanâs self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more
 35230	repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the
 35231	truthâscienceâwhich he himself has invented but which is for him the
 35232	absolute truth.
 35233	
 35234	Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a scienceâthe theory of oblique
 35235	movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Greatâs wars,
 35236	and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to
 35237	him absurd and barbarousâmonstrous collisions in which so many blunders
 35238	were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars,
 35239	they did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as
 35240	material for science.
 35241	
 35242	In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of
 35243	campaign that ended in Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt, but he did not see the least
 35244	proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On
 35245	the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion,
 35246	the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically
 35247	gleeful sarcasm he would remark, âThere, I said the whole affair would
 35248	go to the devil!â Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love
 35249	their theory that they lose sight of the theoryâs objectâits practical
 35250	application. His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and
 35251	he would not listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures
 35252	resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him
 35253	the accuracy of his theory.
 35254	
 35255	He said a few words to Prince Andrew and ChernÃ½shev about the present
 35256	war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong,
 35257	and who is not displeased that it should be so. The unbrushed tufts
 35258	of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples
 35259	expressed this most eloquently.
 35260	
 35261	He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his
 35262	voice were at once heard from there.
 35263	
 35264	
 35265	
 35266	
 35267	
 35268	CHAPTER XI
 35269	
 35270	Prince Andrewâs eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when
 35271	Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to BolkÃ³nski, but not
 35272	pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he
 35273	went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on
 35274	to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign.
 35275	ChernÃ½shev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor,
 35276	who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to
 35277	him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the
 35278	left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward
 35279	evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited
 35280	Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.
 35281	
 35282	âAnd as for the man who advised forming this campâthe Drissa camp,â said
 35283	Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew
 35284	scanned his unfamiliar face, âas to that person, sire...â continued
 35285	Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself, âthe man
 35286	who advised the Drissa campâI see no alternative but the lunatic asylum
 35287	or the gallows!â
 35288	
 35289	Without heeding the end of the Italianâs remarks, and as though
 35290	not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing BolkÃ³nski, addressed him
 35291	graciously.
 35292	
 35293	âI am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait
 35294	for me.â
 35295	
 35296	The Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter
 35297	MikhÃ¡ylovich VolkÃ³nski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them.
 35298	Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperorâs permission, accompanied
 35299	Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the
 35300	council was assembled.
 35301	
 35302	Prince Peter MikhÃ¡ylovich VolkÃ³nski occupied the position, as it were,
 35303	of chief of the Emperorâs staff. He came out of the study into the
 35304	drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put
 35305	questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen
 35306	present. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to be
 35307	false) had been received during the night of a movement by the French to
 35308	outflank the Drissa camp.
 35309	
 35310	The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that
 35311	presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position
 35312	away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was
 35313	inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an
 35314	opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and
 35315	there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that
 35316	plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions
 35317	putâwhich, in fact, his plan did not answerâas to avail himself of the
 35318	opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as
 35319	good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown
 35320	what character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others
 35321	defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish generalâs views
 35322	more warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew from
 35323	his side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he asked permission to
 35324	read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme,
 35325	totally different from Armfeldtâs or Pfuelâs plan of campaign. In answer
 35326	to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged,
 35327	could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap
 35328	(as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.
 35329	
 35330	During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen
 35331	(his âbridgeâ in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted
 35332	contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean
 35333	himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when
 35334	Prince VolkÃ³nski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his
 35335	opinion, he merely said:
 35336	
 35337	âWhy ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an
 35338	exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentlemanâs attackâvery fine, or
 35339	a retreat, also good! Why ask me?â said he. âWhy, you yourselves know
 35340	everything better than I do.â
 35341	
 35342	But when VolkÃ³nski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperorâs name
 35343	that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated,
 35344	began to speak:
 35345	
 35346	âEverything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they
 35347	knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There
 35348	is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly
 35349	adhered to,â said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. âWhat
 35350	is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!â
 35351	
 35352	He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no
 35353	eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that
 35354	everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to
 35355	outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.
 35356	
 35357	Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French.
 35358	Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly,
 35359	and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who
 35360	was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all
 35361	that could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there
 35362	were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan
 35363	had not been precisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he
 35364	demonstrated, and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like
 35365	a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of
 35366	a problem that has already been proved. Wolzogen took his place and
 35367	continued to explain his views in French, every now and then turning to
 35368	Pfuel and saying, âIs it not so, your excellency?â But Pfuel, like a man
 35369	heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at
 35370	his own supporter, Wolzogen:
 35371	
 35372	âWell, of course, what more is there to explain?â
 35373	
 35374	Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French.
 35375	Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to VolkÃ³nski in
 35376	Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.
 35377	
 35378	Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,
 35379	determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present,
 35380	evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no
 35381	hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a
 35382	theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was
 35383	ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary
 35384	respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks
 35385	of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable
 35386	at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleonâs
 35387	genius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder.
 35388	Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him
 35389	from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each otherâs
 35390	proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like
 35391	everyone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of
 35392	respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From the tone in which
 35393	the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to
 35394	speak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation
 35395	in Pfuelâs own expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel
 35396	himself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence
 35397	and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly
 35398	brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he
 35399	concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was
 35400	evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his
 35401	theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world
 35402	was slipping away from him.
 35403	
 35404	The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted
 35405	the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and
 35406	personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general
 35407	conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this
 35408	polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts,
 35409	felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought that had
 35410	long since and often occurred to him during his military activitiesâthe
 35411	idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that
 35412	therefore there can be no such thing as a military geniusânow appeared
 35413	to him an obvious truth. âWhat theory and science is possible about a
 35414	matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot
 35415	be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be
 35416	ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or
 35417	the enemyâs armies will be in a dayâs time, and no one can gauge the
 35418	force of this or that detachment. Sometimesâwhen there is not a coward
 35419	at the front to shout, âWe are cut off!â and start running, but a brave
 35420	and jolly lad who shouts, âHurrah!ââa detachment of five thousand
 35421	is worth thirty thousand, as at SchÃ¶n Grabern, while at times fifty
 35422	thousand run from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can
 35423	there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing
 35424	can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the
 35425	significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives
 35426	no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci
 35427	says we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that
 35428	the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it,
 35429	and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes
 35430	one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the
 35431	advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.
 35432	And why do they all speak of a âmilitary geniusâ? Is a man a genius who
 35433	can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go
 35434	to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are
 35435	invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power,
 35436	attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best
 35437	generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded
 35438	men. BagratiÃ³n was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of
 35439	Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the
 35440	field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any
 35441	special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest
 35442	and best human attributesâlove, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic
 35443	inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he
 35444	is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient
 35445	patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he
 35446	should be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just
 35447	and unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their âgeniusâ was
 35448	invented for them long ago because they have power! The success of a
 35449	military action depends not on them, but on the man in the ranks who
 35450	shouts, âWe are lost!â or who shouts, âHurrah!â And only in the ranks
 35451	can one serve with assurance of being useful.â
 35452	
 35453	So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused
 35454	himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.
 35455	
 35456	At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would
 35457	like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles
 35458	forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereignâs person, but
 35459	for permission to serve in the army.
 35460	
 35461	
 35462	
 35463	
 35464	
 35465	CHAPTER XII
 35466	
 35467	Before the beginning of the campaign, RostÃ³v had received a letter from
 35468	his parents in which they told him briefly of NatÃ¡shaâs illness and the
 35469	breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by
 35470	NatÃ¡shaâs having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from
 35471	the army and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not
 35472	even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the
 35473	army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry NatÃ¡sha was ill and her
 35474	engagement broken off, and that he would do all he could to meet their
 35475	wishes. To SÃ³nya he wrote separately.
 35476	
 35477	âAdored friend of my soul!â he wrote. âNothing but honor could keep
 35478	me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the
 35479	campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comradesâ eyes but
 35480	in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the
 35481	Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly
 35482	the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will
 35483	throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent
 35484	breast.â
 35485	
 35486	It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented
 35487	RostÃ³v from returning home as he had promised and marrying SÃ³nya. The
 35488	autumn in OtrÃ¡dnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas
 35489	holidays and SÃ³nyaâs love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil
 35490	rural joys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now
 35491	allured him. âA splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a
 35492	dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by
 35493	election...â thought he. But now the campaign was beginning, and he had
 35494	to remain with his regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas RostÃ³v,
 35495	as was natural to him, felt contented with the life he led in the
 35496	regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life.
 35497	
 35498	On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed
 35499	by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the
 35500	Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation
 35501	from his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain,
 35502	and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in
 35503	numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.
 35504	
 35505	The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay,
 35506	new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was
 35507	infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement
 35508	of a war, and RostÃ³v, conscious of his advantageous position in the
 35509	regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of
 35510	military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to
 35511	relinquish them.
 35512	
 35513	The troops retired from VÃ­lna for various complicated reasons of state,
 35514	political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by
 35515	a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at
 35516	headquarters. For the PÃ¡vlograd hussars, however, the whole of this
 35517	retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies
 35518	was a very simple and agreeable business.
 35519	
 35520	It was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and
 35521	intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where
 35522	they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only
 35523	because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some
 35524	pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced
 35525	to enter anyoneâs head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good
 35526	soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of
 35527	the task nearest to hand. First they camped gaily before VÃ­lna, making
 35528	acquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being
 35529	reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders. Then came an order
 35530	to retreat to SventsyÃ¡ni and destroy any provisions they could not carry
 35531	away with them. SventsyÃ¡ni was remembered by the hussars only as the
 35532	drunken camp, a name the whole army gave to their encampment there,
 35533	and because many complaints were made against the troops, who, taking
 35534	advantage of the order to collect provisions, took also horses,
 35535	carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. RostÃ³v remembered
 35536	SventsyÃ¡ni, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town
 35537	he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken
 35538	men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels
 35539	of old beer. From SventsyÃ¡ni they retired farther and farther to Drissa,
 35540	and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of Russia
 35541	proper.
 35542	
 35543	On the thirteenth of July the PÃ¡vlograds took part in a serious action
 35544	for the first time.
 35545	
 35546	On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy
 35547	storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable
 35548	for its storms.
 35549	
 35550	The two PÃ¡vlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which
 35551	was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and
 35552	horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and RostÃ³v, with a young
 35553	officer named IlyÃ­n, his protÃ©gÃ©, was sitting in a hastily constructed
 35554	shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending
 35555	onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the
 35556	rain, entered RostÃ³vâs shelter.
 35557	
 35558	âI have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of RaÃ©vskiâs
 35559	exploit?â
 35560	
 35561	And the officer gave them details of the SaltÃ¡nov battle, which he had
 35562	heard at the staff.
 35563	
 35564	RostÃ³v, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water
 35565	trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional
 35566	glance at IlyÃ­n, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad
 35567	of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same
 35568	relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to DenÃ­sov seven years
 35569	before. IlyÃ­n tried to imitate RostÃ³v in everything and adored him as a
 35570	girl might have done.
 35571	
 35572	Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of
 35573	the SaltÃ¡nov dam being âa Russian Thermopylae,â and of how a deed worthy
 35574	of antiquity had been performed by General RaÃ©vski. He recounted how
 35575	RaÃ©vski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had
 35576	charged with them beside him. RostÃ³v heard the story and not only said
 35577	nothing to encourage Zdrzhinskiâs enthusiasm but, on the contrary,
 35578	looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no
 35579	intention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and
 35580	of 1807 RostÃ³v knew by experience that men always lie when describing
 35581	military exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides
 35582	that, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at
 35583	all as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinskiâs
 35584	tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches
 35585	extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was
 35586	his habit, and crowded RostÃ³v in the narrow shanty. RostÃ³v looked at him
 35587	in silence. âIn the first place, there must have been such a confusion
 35588	and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if RaÃ©vski did lead
 35589	his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen
 35590	men nearest to him,â thought he, âthe rest could not have seen how or
 35591	with whom RaÃ©vski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it
 35592	would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with
 35593	RaÃ©vskiâs tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger?
 35594	And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on whether
 35595	they took the SaltÃ¡nov dam or not, as we are told was the case at
 35596	Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose
 35597	his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother PÃ©tya
 35598	there, or even IlyÃ­n, whoâs a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would
 35599	have tried to put them somewhere under cover,â Nicholas continued
 35600	to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his
 35601	thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew
 35602	that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to
 35603	pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.
 35604	
 35605	âI canât stand this any more,â said IlyÃ­n, noticing that RostÃ³v did not
 35606	relish Zdrzhinskiâs conversation. âMy stockings and shirt... and the
 35607	water is running on my seat! Iâll go and look for shelter. The rain
 35608	seems less heavy.â
 35609	
 35610	IlyÃ­n went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.
 35611	
 35612	Five minutes later IlyÃ­n, splashing through the mud, came running back
 35613	to the shanty.
 35614	
 35615	âHurrah! RostÃ³v, come quick! Iâve found it! About two hundred yards away
 35616	thereâs a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can at least get
 35617	dry there, and Mary HendrÃ­khovnaâs there.â
 35618	
 35619	Mary HendrÃ­khovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty young
 35620	German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from lack
 35621	of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in
 35622	the early days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the
 35623	hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among
 35624	the hussar officers.
 35625	
 35626	RostÃ³v threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to LavrÃºshka to
 35627	follow with the things, andânow slipping in the mud, now splashing right
 35628	through itâset off with IlyÃ­n in the lessening rain and the darkness
 35629	that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.
 35630	
 35631	âRostÃ³v, where are you?â
 35632	
 35633	âHere. What lightning!â they called to one another.
 35634	
 35635	
 35636	
 35637	
 35638	
 35639	CHAPTER XIII
 35640	
 35641	In the tavern, before which stood the doctorâs covered cart, there were
 35642	already some five officers. Mary HendrÃ­khovna, a plump little blonde
 35643	German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench
 35644	in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her.
 35645	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts
 35646	and laughter.
 35647	
 35648	âDear me, how jolly we are!â said RostÃ³v laughing.
 35649	
 35650	âAnd why do you stand there gaping?â
 35651	
 35652	âWhat swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Donât make our
 35653	drawing room so wet.â
 35654	
 35655	âDonât mess Mary HendrÃ­khovnaâs dress!â cried other voices.
 35656	
 35657	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n hastened to find a corner where they could change into
 35658	dry clothes without offending Mary HendrÃ­khovnaâs modesty. They were
 35659	going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it
 35660	completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light
 35661	of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no
 35662	account yield their position. Mary HendrÃ­khovna obliged them with the
 35663	loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen
 35664	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n, helped by LavrÃºshka who had brought their kits,
 35665	changed their wet things for dry ones.
 35666	
 35667	A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found,
 35668	fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was
 35669	produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary
 35670	HendrÃ­khovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a
 35671	clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket
 35672	under her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat
 35673	over the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies
 35674	off her husbandâs face, lest he should wake up.
 35675	
 35676	âLeave him alone,â said Mary HendrÃ­khovna, smiling timidly and happily.
 35677	âHe is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.â
 35678	
 35679	âOh, no, Mary HendrÃ­khovna,â replied the officer, âone must look after
 35680	the doctor. Perhaps heâll take pity on me someday, when it comes to
 35681	cutting off a leg or an arm for me.â
 35682	
 35683	There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could
 35684	not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held
 35685	only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to
 35686	take turns in order of seniority to receive oneâs tumbler from Mary
 35687	HendrÃ­khovnaâs plump little hands with their short and not overclean
 35688	nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with
 35689	her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon
 35690	left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general
 35691	mood of courting Mary HendrÃ­khovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by
 35692	such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as
 35693	she might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her
 35694	husband moved in his sleep behind her.
 35695	
 35696	There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything
 35697	else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary
 35698	HendrÃ­khovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. RostÃ³v received
 35699	his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary HendrÃ­khovna to stir
 35700	it.
 35701	
 35702	âBut you take it without sugar?â she said, smiling all the time, as if
 35703	everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and
 35704	had a double meaning.
 35705	
 35706	âIt is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir
 35707	my tea.â
 35708	
 35709	Mary HendrÃ­khovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone
 35710	meanwhile had pounced on.
 35711	
 35712	âUse your finger, Mary HendrÃ­khovna, it will be still nicer,â said
 35713	RostÃ³v.
 35714	
 35715	âToo hot!â she replied, blushing with pleasure.
 35716	
 35717	IlyÃ­n put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to
 35718	Mary HendrÃ­khovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.
 35719	
 35720	âThis is my cup,â said he. âOnly dip your finger in it and Iâll drink it
 35721	all up.â
 35722	
 35723	When they had emptied the samovar, RostÃ³v took a pack of cards and
 35724	proposed that they should play âKingsâ with Mary HendrÃ­khovna. They drew
 35725	lots to settle who should make up her set. At RostÃ³vâs suggestion it
 35726	was agreed that whoever became âKingâ should have the right to kiss Mary
 35727	HendrÃ­khovnaâs hand, and that the âBoobyâ should go to refill and reheat
 35728	the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.
 35729	
 35730	âWell, but supposing Mary HendrÃ­khovna is âKingâ?â asked IlyÃ­n.
 35731	
 35732	âAs it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!â
 35733	
 35734	They had hardly begun to play before the doctorâs disheveled head
 35735	suddenly appeared from behind Mary HendrÃ­khovna. He had been awake for
 35736	some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing
 35737	entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and
 35738	depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked
 35739	to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he
 35740	had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary
 35741	HendrÃ­khovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became
 35742	still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor
 35743	told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in
 35744	alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go
 35745	to sleep in their covered cart, or everything in it would be stolen.
 35746	
 35747	âBut Iâll send an orderly.... Two of them!â said RostÃ³v. âWhat an idea,
 35748	doctor!â
 35749	
 35750	âIâll stand guard on it myself!â said IlyÃ­n.
 35751	
 35752	âNo, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two
 35753	nights,â replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife,
 35754	waiting for the game to end.
 35755	
 35756	Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew
 35757	still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for
 35758	which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking
 35759	his wife with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart,
 35760	the officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their
 35761	wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged
 35762	remarks, recalling the doctorâs uneasiness and his wifeâs delight, now
 35763	they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the
 35764	covered trap. Several times RostÃ³v, covering his head, tried to go
 35765	to sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be
 35766	resumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.
 35767	
 35768	
 35769	
 35770	
 35771	
 35772	CHAPTER XIV
 35773	
 35774	It was nearly three oâclock but no one was yet asleep, when the
 35775	quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town
 35776	of OstrÃ³vna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly
 35777	getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But
 35778	RostÃ³v went off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was
 35779	breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt
 35780	damp and cold, especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left
 35781	the tavern in the twilight of the dawn, RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n both glanced
 35782	under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctorâs cart, from
 35783	under the apron of which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle
 35784	of which his wifeâs nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing
 35785	audible.
 35786	
 35787	âShe really is a dear little thing,â said RostÃ³v to IlyÃ­n, who was
 35788	following him.
 35789	
 35790	âA charming woman!â said IlyÃ­n, with all the gravity of a boy of
 35791	sixteen.
 35792	
 35793	Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command
 35794	was heard to âmountâ and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted.
 35795	RostÃ³v riding in front gave the order âForward!â and the hussars, with
 35796	clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horsesâ hoofs splashing in the
 35797	mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch
 35798	trees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone
 35799	on in front.
 35800	
 35801	Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding
 35802	before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass
 35803	which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still
 35804	wet with the nightâs rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also
 35805	wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one
 35806	side. The soldiersâ faces were more and more clearly visible. RostÃ³v,
 35807	always closely followed by IlyÃ­n, rode along the side of the road
 35808	between two rows of birch trees.
 35809	
 35810	When campaigning, RostÃ³v allowed himself the indulgence of riding not
 35811	a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman,
 35812	he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, DonÃ©ts horse,
 35813	dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could
 35814	outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought
 35815	of the horse, of the morning, of the doctorâs wife, but not once of the
 35816	impending danger.
 35817	
 35818	Formerly, when going into action, RostÃ³v had felt afraid; now he had
 35819	not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown
 35820	used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because
 35821	he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown
 35822	accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would
 35823	seem most likely to interest himâthe impending danger. During the
 35824	first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached
 35825	himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time
 35826	it had come of itself. Now he rode beside IlyÃ­n under the birch trees,
 35827	occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes
 35828	touching his horseâs side with his foot, or, without turning round,
 35829	handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as
 35830	calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride. He
 35831	glanced with pity at the excited face of IlyÃ­n, who talked much and in
 35832	great agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of
 35833	terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could
 35834	help him.
 35835	
 35836	As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds,
 35837	the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning
 35838	after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and
 35839	all was still. The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared
 35840	behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it
 35841	reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its
 35842	edge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as
 35843	if in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.
 35844	
 35845	Before RostÃ³v had had time to consider and determine the distance of
 35846	that firing, Count Ostermann-TolstÃ³yâs adjutant came galloping from
 35847	VÃ­tebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.
 35848	
 35849	The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the batteryâwhich had
 35850	also quickened their paceârode down a hill, and passing through an empty
 35851	and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather and the
 35852	men to flush.
 35853	
 35854	âHalt! Dress your ranks!â the order of the regimental commander was
 35855	heard ahead. âForward by the left. Walk, march!â came the order from in
 35856	front.
 35857	
 35858	And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of
 35859	our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To
 35860	the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve.
 35861	Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through
 35862	the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning
 35863	sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemyâs
 35864	columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard
 35865	briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.
 35866	
 35867	At these sounds, long unheard, RostÃ³vâs spirits rose, as at the strains
 35868	of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together,
 35869	now several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then
 35870	again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding
 35871	them.
 35872	
 35873	The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade
 35874	began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron,
 35875	halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to
 35876	the guns.
 35877	
 35878	After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.
 35879	
 35880	âForm column! Prepare to charge!â
 35881	
 35882	The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry
 35883	to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering,
 35884	and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to
 35885	the left.
 35886	
 35887	As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up
 35888	the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by the
 35889	Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but fell
 35890	spent without taking effect.
 35891	
 35892	The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more
 35893	pleasurable and exhilarating effect on RostÃ³v than the previous sounds
 35894	of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out
 35895	before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement
 35896	of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something
 35897	confused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our
 35898	Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more
 35899	to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and
 35900	behind them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could
 35901	be seen.
 35902

 35904	
 35905	
 35906	
 35907	CHAPTER XV
 35908	
 35909	RostÃ³v, with his keen sportsmanâs eye, was one of the first to catch
 35910	sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and
 35911	nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons
 35912	pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small
 35913	at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their
 35914	arms and their sabers in the air.
 35915	
 35916	RostÃ³v gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt
 35917	instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the
 35918	latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must
 35919	be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked
 35920	around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with
 35921	eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.
 35922	
 35923	âAndrew SevastyÃ¡nych!â said RostÃ³v. âYou know, we could crush them....â
 35924	
 35925	âA fine thing too!â replied the captain, âand really...â
 35926	
 35927	RostÃ³v, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to
 35928	the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the
 35929	word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following
 35930	him. RostÃ³v himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he
 35931	did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons
 35932	near and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not
 35933	withstand an attackâknew there was only that moment and that if he let
 35934	it slip it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so
 35935	stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could
 35936	not restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command,
 35937	and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his
 35938	deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons.
 35939	Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace
 35940	instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they
 35941	drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after
 35942	them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the
 35943	foremost began to turn, while those behind began to halt. With the same
 35944	feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, RostÃ³v
 35945	gave rein to his DonÃ©ts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the
 35946	dragoonsâ disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot
 35947	flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless
 35948	horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were
 35949	galloping back. RostÃ³v, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after
 35950	him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and
 35951	almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would
 35952	immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his
 35953	uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse
 35954	and urging it on with his saber. In another moment RostÃ³vâs horse dashed
 35955	its breast against the hindquarters of the officerâs horse, almost
 35956	knocking it over, and at the same instant RostÃ³v, without knowing why,
 35957	raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.
 35958	
 35959	The instant he had done this, all RostÃ³vâs animation vanished. The
 35960	officer fell, not so much from the blowâwhich had but slightly cut his
 35961	arm above the elbowâas from the shock to his horse and from fright.
 35962	RostÃ³v reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he
 35963	had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on
 35964	the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed
 35965	up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at
 35966	RostÃ³v with shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained faceâfair and
 35967	young, with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyesâwas not an enemyâs
 35968	face at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face.
 35969	Before RostÃ³v had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, âI
 35970	surrender!â He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the
 35971	stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from RostÃ³vâs face.
 35972	Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the
 35973	saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was
 35974	wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his
 35975	horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him;
 35976	a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the
 35977	French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily
 35978	back with their prisoners. RostÃ³v galloped back with the rest, aware of
 35979	an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and
 35980	confused, which he could not at all account for, had come over him with
 35981	the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him.
 35982	
 35983	Count Ostermann-TolstÃ³y met the returning hussars, sent for RostÃ³v,
 35984	thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor
 35985	and would recommend him for a St. Georgeâs Cross. When sent for by Count
 35986	Ostermann, RostÃ³v, remembering that he had charged without orders,
 35987	felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of
 35988	discipline. Ostermannâs flattering words and promise of a reward should
 35989	therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt
 35990	that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. âBut what
 35991	on earth is worrying me?â he asked himself as he rode back from the
 35992	general. âIlyÃ­n? No, heâs safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No,
 35993	thatâs not it.â Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. âYes,
 35994	oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm
 35995	paused when I raised it.â
 35996	
 35997	RostÃ³v saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have
 35998	a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was sitting in
 35999	his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about
 36000	him. The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He
 36001	glanced at RostÃ³v with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting.
 36002	RostÃ³v still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.
 36003	
 36004	All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that RostÃ³v,
 36005	without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied.
 36006	He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something
 36007	over in his mind.
 36008	
 36009	RostÃ³v was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to
 36010	his amazement had gained him the St. Georgeâs Cross and even given him
 36011	a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all
 36012	understand. âSo others are even more afraid than I am!â he thought. âSo
 36013	thatâs all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my
 36014	countryâs sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes?
 36015	And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should
 36016	I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. Georgeâs
 36017	Cross.... I canât make it out at all.â
 36018	
 36019	But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach
 36020	no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the
 36021	service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at
 36022	OstrÃ³vna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar
 36023	battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen.

 36029	CHAPTER XVI
 36030	
 36031	On receiving news of NatÃ¡shaâs illness, the countess, though not quite
 36032	well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with PÃ©tya and the rest of the
 36033	household, and the whole family moved from MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâs house to
 36034	their own and settled down in town.
 36035	
 36036	NatÃ¡shaâs illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for
 36037	her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness,
 36038	her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the
 36039	background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider
 36040	in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat
 36041	or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them
 36042	feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help
 36043	her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in
 36044	French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great
 36045	variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple
 36046	idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease
 36047	NatÃ¡sha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be
 36048	known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always
 36049	has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to
 36050	medicineânot a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so
 36051	on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the
 36052	innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs. This simple
 36053	thought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard
 36054	that he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their
 36055	lives was to cure, and they received money for it and had spent the best
 36056	years of their lives on that business. But, above all, that thought
 36057	was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were
 36058	really useful, as in fact they were to the whole RostÃ³v family. Their
 36059	usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for
 36060	the most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they
 36061	were given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and
 36062	indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and
 36063	of those who loved herâand that is why there are, and always will be,
 36064	pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied
 36065	that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that
 36066	something should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They
 36067	satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it
 36068	wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself
 36069	and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching
 36070	spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child
 36071	cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no
 36072	remedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and the expression of its
 36073	motherâs sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were
 36074	of use to NatÃ¡sha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her
 36075	that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemistâs in
 36076	the ArbÃ¡t and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble
 36077	and seventy kopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at
 36078	intervals of precisely two hours, neither more nor less.
 36079	
 36080	What would SÃ³nya and the count and countess have done, how would they
 36081	have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills
 36082	to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the
 36083	other details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which
 36084	supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How would
 36085	the count have borne his dearly loved daughterâs illness had he not
 36086	known that it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not
 36087	grudge thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her
 36088	illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take
 36089	her abroad for consultations there, and had he not been able to explain
 36090	the details of how MÃ©tivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms,
 36091	but Frise had, and MÃºdrov had diagnosed them even better? What would the
 36092	countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid
 36093	for not strictly obeying the doctorâs orders?
 36094	
 36095	âYouâll never get well like that,â she would say, forgetting her grief
 36096	in her vexation, âif you wonât obey the doctor and take your medicine at
 36097	the right time! You mustnât trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to
 36098	pneumonia,â she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of
 36099	that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.
 36100	
 36101	What would SÃ³nya have done without the glad consciousness that she had
 36102	not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be ready to
 36103	carry out all the doctorâs injunctions with precision, and that she
 36104	still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the
 36105	slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered?
 36106	Even to NatÃ¡sha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices
 36107	were being made for her sake, and to know that she had to take medicine
 36108	at certain hours, though she declared that no medicine would cure her
 36109	and that it was all nonsense. And it was even pleasant to be able to
 36110	show, by disregarding the orders, that she did not believe in medical
 36111	treatment and did not value her life.
 36112	
 36113	The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and
 36114	regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he had
 36115	gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he
 36116	assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though
 36117	there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and
 36118	one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but... And
 36119	the countess, trying to conceal the action from herself and from him,
 36120	slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient
 36121	with a more tranquil mind.
 36122	
 36123	The symptoms of NatÃ¡shaâs illness were that she ate little, slept
 36124	little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that
 36125	she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the
 36126	stifling atmosphere of the town, and the RostÃ³vs did not move to the
 36127	country that summer of 1812.
 36128	
 36129	In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out
 36130	of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of
 36131	such things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of
 36132	the country life to which she was accustomed, youth prevailed. NatÃ¡shaâs
 36133	grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life, it ceased
 36134	to press so painfully on her heart, it gradually faded into the past,
 36135	and she began to recover physically.
 36136	
 36137	
 36138	
 36139	
 36140	
 36141	CHAPTER XVII
 36142	
 36143	NatÃ¡sha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external
 36144	forms of pleasureâballs, promenades, concerts, and theatersâbut she
 36145	never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not
 36146	sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears
 36147	choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure
 36148	times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so
 36149	uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy.
 36150	Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy,
 36151	in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to
 36152	coquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no
 36153	man was more to her than NastÃ¡sya IvÃ¡novna, the buffoon. Something stood
 36154	sentinel within her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all
 36155	the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full
 36156	of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, âUncle,â and the Christmas
 36157	holidays spent with Nicholas at OtrÃ¡dnoe were what she recalled oftenest
 36158	and most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a
 36159	single day of that time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at
 36160	the time had not deceived herâthat that state of freedom and readiness
 36161	for any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live
 36162	on.
 36163	
 36164	It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly
 36165	imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But
 36166	this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, âWhat next?â
 36167	But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was
 36168	passing. NatÃ¡sha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to
 36169	anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in
 36170	the house and felt at ease only with her brother PÃ©tya. She liked to
 36171	be with him better than with the others, and when alone with him she
 36172	sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left the house and of those who came
 36173	to see them was glad to see only one person, Pierre. It would have been
 36174	impossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the
 36175	same time more seriously than did Count BezÃºkhov. NatÃ¡sha unconsciously
 36176	felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society. But
 36177	she was not even grateful to him for it; nothing good on Pierreâs part
 36178	seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind
 36179	to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes NatÃ¡sha
 36180	noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence,
 36181	especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that
 36182	something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her. She
 36183	noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness,
 36184	which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her.
 36185	After those involuntary wordsâthat if he were free he would have asked
 36186	on his knees for her hand and her loveâuttered at a moment when she was
 36187	so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to NatÃ¡sha of his feelings;
 36188	and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted
 36189	her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort
 36190	a crying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because
 36191	NatÃ¡sha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of
 36192	which she had experienced with KurÃ¡gin that it never entered her head
 36193	that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her
 36194	part, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious,
 36195	romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known
 36196	several instances.
 36197	
 36198	Before the end of the fast of St. Peter, AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novna BelÃ³va, a
 36199	country neighbor of the RostÃ³vs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at
 36200	the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that NatÃ¡sha should fast
 36201	and prepare for Holy Communion, and NatÃ¡sha gladly welcomed the idea.
 36202	Despite the doctorâs orders that she should not go out early in the
 36203	morning, NatÃ¡sha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament,
 36204	not as they generally prepared for it in the RostÃ³v family by attending
 36205	three services in their own house, but as AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novna did, by
 36206	going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers,
 36207	Matins, or Mass.
 36208	
 36209	The countess was pleased with NatÃ¡shaâs zeal; after the poor results of
 36210	the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer
 36211	might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without
 36212	fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to NatÃ¡shaâs wish and
 36213	entrusted her to BelÃ³va. AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novna used to come to wake NatÃ¡sha
 36214	at three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was
 36215	afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on
 36216	her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, NatÃ¡sha, shivering in the fresh
 36217	air, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn.
 36218	By AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novnaâs advice NatÃ¡sha prepared herself not in their
 36219	own parish, but at a church where, according to the devout AgrafÃ©na
 36220	IvÃ¡novna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were
 36221	never many people in the church; NatÃ¡sha always stood beside BelÃ³va in
 36222	the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the
 36223	screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of
 36224	humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her when
 36225	at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin
 36226	illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light
 36227	falling from the window, she listened to the words of the service which
 36228	she tried to follow with understanding. When she understood them her
 36229	personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its
 36230	own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that
 36231	the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to
 36232	understand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit
 36233	oneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She
 36234	crossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror
 36235	at her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything,
 36236	everything, to have mercy upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered
 36237	herself most of all were those of repentance. On her way home at an
 36238	early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men
 36239	sweeping the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep,
 36240	NatÃ¡sha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility
 36241	of correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of
 36242	happiness.
 36243	
 36244	During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every
 36245	day. And the happiness of taking communion, or âcommuningâ as AgrafÃ©na
 36246	IvÃ¡novna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to NatÃ¡sha
 36247	so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.
 36248	
 36249	But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in
 36250	white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for
 36251	many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life
 36252	that lay before her.
 36253	
 36254	The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the
 36255	powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.
 36256	
 36257	âShe must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,â said
 36258	he, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. âOnly, please be
 36259	particular about it.
 36260	
 36261	âBe quite easy,â he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold
 36262	coin in his palm. âShe will soon be singing and frolicking about. The
 36263	last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has freshened
 36264	up very much.â
 36265	
 36266	The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her
 36267	nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room.
 36268	
 36269	
 36270	
 36271	
 36272	
 36273	CHAPTER XVIII
 36274	
 36275	At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war
 36276	began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to
 36277	the people, and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow. And as
 36278	up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received,
 36279	exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of
 36280	Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was
 36281	in danger, it was said that SmolÃ©nsk had surrendered, that Napoleon had
 36282	an army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.
 36283	
 36284	On the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received
 36285	but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the RostÃ³vsâ, promised
 36286	to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto
 36287	and appeal, which he would obtain from Count RostopchÃ­n.
 36288	
 36289	That Sunday, the RostÃ³vs went to Mass at the RazumÃ³vskisâ private chapel
 36290	as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten oâclock, when the RostÃ³vs
 36291	got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of
 36292	hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves
 36293	of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white
 36294	trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on
 36295	the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that
 36296	summer languor, that content and discontent with the present, which
 36297	is most strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow
 36298	notabilities, all the RostÃ³vsâ acquaintances, were at the RazumÃ³vskisâ
 36299	chapel, for, as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families
 36300	who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that
 36301	summer. As NatÃ¡sha, at her motherâs side, passed through the crowd
 36302	behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a
 36303	young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.
 36304	
 36305	âThatâs RostÃ³va, the one who...â
 36306	
 36307	âSheâs much thinner, but all the same sheâs pretty!â
 36308	
 36309	She heard, or thought she heard, the names of KurÃ¡gin and BolkÃ³nski. But
 36310	she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that everyone
 36311	who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her. With a
 36312	sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself
 36313	in a crowd, NatÃ¡sha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace
 36314	walkedâas women can walkâwith the more repose and stateliness the
 36315	greater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she
 36316	was pretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to.
 36317	On the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late, and
 36318	particularly so on this bright, hot summer day in town. âItâs Sunday
 36319	againâanother week past,â she thought, recalling that she had been here
 36320	the Sunday before, âand always the same life that is no life, and the
 36321	same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live. Iâm pretty,
 36322	Iâm young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I
 36323	know I am good,â she thought, âbut yet my best years are slipping by
 36324	and are no good to anyone.â She stood by her motherâs side and exchanged
 36325	nods with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladiesâ
 36326	dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not
 36327	crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought
 36328	with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others,
 36329	and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own
 36330	vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to
 36331	her.
 36332	
 36333	A comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that
 36334	mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the
 36335	souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed,
 36336	the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice
 36337	pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not
 36338	understand, made NatÃ¡shaâs breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive
 36339	feeling agitated her.
 36340	
 36341	âTeach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good
 36342	forever, forever!â she pleaded.
 36343	
 36344	The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and,
 36345	holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic
 36346	and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and
 36347	solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer....
 36348	
 36349	âIn peace let us pray unto the Lord.â
 36350	
 36351	âAs one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united
 36352	by brotherly loveâlet us pray!â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 36353	
 36354	âFor the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls.â
 36355	
 36356	âFor the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,â prayed
 36357	NatÃ¡sha.
 36358	
 36359	When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and
 36360	DenÃ­sov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she
 36361	remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her
 36362	all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us,
 36363	she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and
 36364	SÃ³nya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward
 36365	them, and feeling all the strength of her love for them. When they
 36366	prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and
 36367	people who hated her, in order to pray for them. She included among her
 36368	enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her
 36369	father, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she
 36370	remembered Anatole who had done her so much harmâand though he did not
 36371	hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy. Only at prayer did
 36372	she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole,
 36373	as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and
 36374	devotion to God. When they prayed for the Imperial family and the Synod,
 36375	she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross, saying to herself
 36376	that even if she did not understand, still she could not doubt, and at
 36377	any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it.
 36378	
 36379	When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his
 36380	breast and said, âLet us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ
 36381	the Lord!â
 36382	
 36383	âCommit ourselves to God,â NatÃ¡sha inwardly repeated. âLord God, I
 36384	submit myself to Thy will!â she thought. âI want nothing, wish for
 36385	nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take
 36386	me!â prayed NatÃ¡sha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing
 36387	herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some
 36388	invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself,
 36389	from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.
 36390	
 36391	The countess looked round several times at her daughterâs softened face
 36392	and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.
 36393	
 36394	Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order
 36395	NatÃ¡sha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he
 36396	knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors
 36397	of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his purple velvet
 36398	biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort.
 36399	Everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in
 36400	surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the Synodâa prayer for
 36401	the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.
 36402	
 36403	âLord God of might, God of our salvation!â began the priest in that
 36404	voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav clergy
 36405	read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.
 36406	
 36407	âLord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and
 36408	blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and
 36409	have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay
 36410	waste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are gathered
 36411	together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy
 36412	beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to
 36413	desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked
 36414	triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful power?
 36415	
 36416	âLord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might
 36417	our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander PÃ¡vlovich; be
 36418	mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to his
 36419	righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless his
 36420	counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by
 36421	Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou
 36422	gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over
 36423	Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who
 36424	have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength
 36425	for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us;
 36426	confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may
 36427	they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the
 36428	wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight; may
 36429	they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the plots they have laid
 36430	in secret be turned against them; let them fall before Thy servantsâ
 36431	feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art able to save both
 36432	great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot prevail against Thee!
 36433	
 36434	âGod of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness
 36435	which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us, but be gracious to our
 36436	unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not
 36437	our transgressions and iniquities! Create in us a clean heart and renew
 36438	a right spirit within us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our
 36439	hope, inspire us with true love one for another, arm us with unity of
 36440	spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and
 36441	to our fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against
 36442	the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.
 36443	
 36444	âO Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust, let us
 36445	not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token of Thy
 36446	blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and
 36447	be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that Thou art
 36448	the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord,
 36449	and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice
 36450	in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath
 36451	the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor,
 36452	and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all
 36453	glory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without
 36454	end. Amen.â
 36455	
 36456	In NatÃ¡shaâs receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her
 36457	strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over
 36458	Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about
 36459	the destruction of âThy Jerusalem,â and she prayed to God with the
 36460	tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but without
 36461	fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer. She
 36462	shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness,
 36463	for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation
 36464	by love. But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under
 36465	foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more
 36466	of them that she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt the
 36467	righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees. She
 36468	felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the
 36469	punishment that overtakes men for their sins, and especially of her own
 36470	sins, and she prayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, and to
 36471	give them all, and her too, peace and happiness. And it seemed to her
 36472	that God heard her prayer.
 36473	
 36474	
 36475	
 36476	
 36477	
 36478	CHAPTER XIX
 36479	
 36480	From the day when Pierre, after leaving the RostÃ³vsâ with NatÃ¡shaâs
 36481	grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to
 36482	be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own
 36483	horizonâfrom that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all
 36484	earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented
 36485	itself. That terrible question âWhy?â âWherefore?â which had come to him
 36486	amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a
 36487	reply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or
 36488	himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of
 36489	human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did
 36490	not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so
 36491	transient and incomprehensibleâbut he remembered her as he had last
 36492	seen her, and all his doubts vanishedânot because she had answered
 36493	the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her
 36494	transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual
 36495	activity in which no one could be justified or guiltyâa realm of beauty
 36496	and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness
 36497	presented itself to him, he said to himself:
 36498	
 36499	âWell, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the
 36500	country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She
 36501	smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and
 36502	no one will ever know it.â And his soul felt calm and peaceful.
 36503	
 36504	Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle
 36505	and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the RostÃ³vsâ
 36506	there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and
 36507	acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along
 36508	irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports came
 36509	from the seat of war and NatÃ¡shaâs health began to improve and she
 36510	no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an
 36511	ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took
 36512	possession of him. He felt that the condition he was in could not
 36513	continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his
 36514	whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that
 36515	approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had revealed to
 36516	Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the
 36517	Revelation of St. John.
 36518	
 36519	In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:
 36520	
 36521	Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of
 36522	the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred
 36523	threescore and six.
 36524	
 36525	And in the fifth verse of the same chapter:
 36526	
 36527	And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
 36528	blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two
 36529	months.
 36530	
 36531	
 36532	The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the
 36533	Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others
 36534	tens, will have the following significance:
 36535	
 36536	      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k
 36537	      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
 36538	       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s
 36539	      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90
 36540	             t    u    v    w    x    y
 36541	            100  110  120  130  140  150
 36542	                        z
 36543	                       160
 36544	
 36545	Writing the words LâEmpereur NapolÃ©on in numbers, it appears that the
 36546	sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold
 36547	in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words
 36548	quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that âspoke
 36549	great things and blasphemies,â the same number 666 was obtained; from
 36550	which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleonâs power had come
 36551	in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy
 36552	pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an
 36553	end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the
 36554	same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an
 36555	answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words LâEmpereur
 36556	Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums
 36557	were either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations he
 36558	wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the
 36559	sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling,
 36560	substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le, still
 36561	without obtaining the desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the
 36562	answer to the question were contained in his name, his nationality would
 36563	also be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding
 36564	up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five was
 36565	represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the
 36566	word Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the
 36567	answer he sought. Lârusse Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited him.
 36568	How, or by what means, he was connected with the great event foretold in
 36569	the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for
 36570	a moment. His love for NatÃ¡sha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the
 36571	comet, 666, LâEmpereur NapolÃ©on, and Lârusse Besuhofâall this had to
 36572	mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere
 36573	of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a
 36574	great achievement and great happiness.
 36575	
 36576	    * Forty-two.
 36577	
 36578	
 36579	On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had
 36580	promised the RostÃ³vs to bring them, from Count RostopchÃ­n whom he knew
 36581	well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the
 36582	morning, when he went to call at RostopchÃ­nâs he met there a courier
 36583	fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at
 36584	Moscow balls.
 36585	
 36586	âDo, please, for heavenâs sake, relieve me of something!â said the
 36587	courier. âI have a sackful of letters to parents.â
 36588	
 36589	Among these letters was one from Nicholas RostÃ³v to his father. Pierre
 36590	took that letter, and RostopchÃ­n also gave him the Emperorâs appeal to
 36591	Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own
 36592	most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in
 36593	one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of
 36594	Nicholas RostÃ³v, awarded a St. Georgeâs Cross of the Fourth Class for
 36595	courage shown in the OstrÃ³vna affair, and in the same order the name
 36596	of Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski, appointed to the command of a regiment of
 36597	Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind the RostÃ³vs of BolkÃ³nski,
 36598	Pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their
 36599	sonâs having received a decoration, so he sent that printed army order
 36600	and Nicholasâ letter to the RostÃ³vs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin,
 36601	and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner.
 36602	
 36603	His conversation with Count RostopchÃ­n and the latterâs tone of anxious
 36604	hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly
 36605	things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in
 36606	Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised
 36607	to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the
 36608	Emperorâs being expected to arrive next dayâall aroused with fresh force
 36609	that feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had been
 36610	conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially
 36611	since the beginning of the war.
 36612	
 36613	He had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so
 36614	had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of
 36615	Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual
 36616	peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he
 36617	saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking
 36618	patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief
 36619	reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the
 36620	vague idea that he was Lârusse Besuhof who had the number of the beast,
 36621	666; that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the
 36622	power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been
 36623	predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake
 36624	anything, but wait for what was bound to come to pass.
 36625	
 36626	
 36627	
 36628	
 36629	
 36630	CHAPTER XX
 36631	
 36632	A few intimate friends were dining with the RostÃ³vs that day, as usual
 36633	on Sundays.
 36634	
 36635	Pierre came early so as to find them alone.
 36636	
 36637	He had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he
 36638	not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his
 36639	bulk with evident ease.
 36640	
 36641	He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman did
 36642	not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was
 36643	at the RostÃ³vsâ he stayed till midnight. The RostÃ³vsâ footman rushed
 36644	eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and
 36645	stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the
 36646	anteroom.
 36647	
 36648	The first person he saw in the house was NatÃ¡sha. Even before he saw
 36649	her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa
 36650	exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her
 36651	illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He
 36652	opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at
 36653	church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he
 36654	opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised
 36655	face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.
 36656	
 36657	âI want to try to sing again,â she said, adding as if by way of excuse,
 36658	âit is, at least, something to do.â
 36659	
 36660	âThatâs capital!â
 36661	
 36662	âHow glad I am youâve come! I am so happy today,â she said, with the old
 36663	animation Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. âYou know Nicholas
 36664	has received a St. Georgeâs Cross? I am so proud of him.â
 36665	
 36666	âOh yes, I sent that announcement. But I donât want to interrupt you,â
 36667	he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.
 36668	
 36669	NatÃ¡sha stopped him.
 36670	
 36671	âCount, is it wrong of me to sing?â she said blushing, and fixing her
 36672	eyes inquiringly on him.
 36673	
 36674	âNo... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?â
 36675	
 36676	âI donât know myself,â NatÃ¡sha answered quickly, âbut I should not like
 36677	to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You
 36678	donât know how important you are to me, how much youâve done for me....â
 36679	She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. âI
 36680	saw in that same army order that he, BolkÃ³nskiâ (she whispered the name
 36681	hastily), âis in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?ââshe
 36682	was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail
 36683	herââWill he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling
 36684	toward me? What do you think? What do you think?â
 36685	
 36686	âI think...â Pierre replied, âthat he has nothing to forgive.... If I
 36687	were in his place...â
 36688	
 36689	By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day
 36690	when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but
 36691	the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her
 36692	hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession
 36693	of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him
 36694	time to say them.
 36695	
 36696	âYes, you... you...â she said, uttering the word you rapturouslyââthatâs
 36697	a different thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or better than
 36698	you; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now too, I donât
 36699	know what would have become of me, because...â
 36700	
 36701	Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music
 36702	before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and
 36703	down the room.
 36704	
 36705	Just then PÃ©tya came running in from the drawing room.
 36706	
 36707	PÃ©tya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and
 36708	resembled NatÃ¡sha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and
 36709	his friend ObolÃ©nski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.
 36710	
 36711	PÃ©tya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair.
 36712	He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the
 36713	hussars.
 36714	
 36715	Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what PÃ©tya
 36716	was saying.
 36717	
 36718	PÃ©tya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.
 36719	
 36720	âWell, what about my plan? Peter KirÃ­lych, for heavenâs sake! You are my
 36721	only hope,â said PÃ©tya.
 36722	
 36723	âOh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? Iâll mention it, Iâll bring it
 36724	all up today.â
 36725	
 36726	âWell, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?â asked the old count. âThe
 36727	countess has been to Mass at the RazumÃ³vskisâ and heard the new prayer.
 36728	She says itâs very fine.â
 36729	
 36730	âYes, Iâve got it,â said Pierre. âThe Emperor is to be here tomorrow...
 36731	thereâs to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are
 36732	talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate
 36733	you!â
 36734	
 36735	âYes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?â
 36736	
 36737	âWe are again retreating. They say weâre already near SmolÃ©nsk,â replied
 36738	Pierre.
 36739	
 36740	âO Lord, O Lord!â exclaimed the count. âWhere is the manifesto?â
 36741	
 36742	âThe Emperorâs appeal? Oh yes!â
 36743	
 36744	Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find
 36745	them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess
 36746	who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting
 36747	NatÃ¡sha, who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing
 36748	room.
 36749	
 36750	âOn my word, I donât know what Iâve done with it,â he said.
 36751	
 36752	âThere he is, always losing everything!â remarked the countess.
 36753	
 36754	NatÃ¡sha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and
 36755	sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierreâs
 36756	features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still
 36757	searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.
 36758	
 36759	âNo, really! Iâll drive home, I must have left them there. Iâll
 36760	certainly...â
 36761	
 36762	âBut youâll be late for dinner.â
 36763	
 36764	âOh! And my coachman has gone.â
 36765	
 36766	But SÃ³nya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had
 36767	found them in Pierreâs hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the
 36768	lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.
 36769	
 36770	âNo, after dinner,â said the old count, evidently expecting much
 36771	enjoyment from that reading.
 36772	
 36773	At dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new
 36774	chevalier of St. George, ShinshÃ­n told them the town news, of the
 36775	illness of the old Georgian princess, of MÃ©tivierâs disappearance from
 36776	Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to RostopchÃ­n
 36777	and accused of being a French âspyerâ (so Count RostopchÃ­n had told the
 36778	story), and how RostopchÃ­n let him go and assured the people that he was
 36779	ânot a spire at all, but only an old German ruin.â
 36780	
 36781	âPeople are being arrested...â said the count. âIâve told the countess
 36782	she should not speak French so much. Itâs not the time for it now.â
 36783	
 36784	âAnd have you heard?â ShinshÃ­n asked. âPrince GolÃ­tsyn has engaged a
 36785	master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in
 36786	the streets.â
 36787	
 36788	âAnd how about you, Count Peter KirÃ­lych? If they call up the militia,
 36789	you too will have to mount a horse,â remarked the old count, addressing
 36790	Pierre.
 36791	
 36792	Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not
 36793	to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.
 36794	
 36795	âOh yes, the war,â he said. âNo! What sort of warrior should I make? And
 36796	yet everything is so strange, so strange! I canât make it out. I donât
 36797	know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no
 36798	one can answer for himself.â
 36799	
 36800	After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and
 36801	with a serious face asked SÃ³nya, who was considered an excellent reader,
 36802	to read the appeal.
 36803	
 36804	âTo Moscow, our ancient Capital!
 36805	
 36806	âThe enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He
 36807	comes to despoil our beloved country.â
 36808	
 36809	SÃ³nya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened
 36810	with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.
 36811	
 36812	NatÃ¡sha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and
 36813	now at Pierre.
 36814	
 36815	Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess
 36816	shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression
 36817	in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger
 36818	threatening her son would not soon be over. ShinshÃ­n, with a sarcastic
 36819	smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that
 36820	gave him the opportunity: SÃ³nyaâs reading, any remark of the countâs, or
 36821	even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.
 36822	
 36823	After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes the
 36824	Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility,
 36825	SÃ³nya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was
 36826	being paid to her, read the last words:
 36827	
 36828	âWe ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital
 36829	and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the direction
 36830	of all our levies, both those now barring the enemyâs path and those
 36831	freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the ruin he
 36832	hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered
 36833	from bondage glorify the name of Russia!â
 36834	
 36835	
 36836	âYes, thatâs it!â cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing
 36837	repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he
 36838	added, âLet the Emperor but say the word and weâll sacrifice everything
 36839	and begrudge nothing.â
 36840	
 36841	Before ShinshÃ­n had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the
 36842	countâs patriotism, NatÃ¡sha jumped up from her place and ran to her
 36843	father.
 36844	
 36845	âWhat a darling our Papa is!â she cried, kissing him, and she again
 36846	looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her
 36847	with her better spirits.
 36848	
 36849	âThere! Hereâs a patriot for you!â said ShinshÃ­n.
 36850	
 36851	âNot a patriot at all, but simply...â NatÃ¡sha replied in an injured
 36852	tone. âEverything seems funny to you, but this isnât at all a joke....â
 36853	
 36854	âA joke indeed!â put in the count. âLet him but say the word and weâll
 36855	all go.... Weâre not Germans!â
 36856	
 36857	âBut did you notice, it says, âfor consultationâ?â said Pierre.
 36858	
 36859	âNever mind what itâs for....â
 36860	
 36861	At this moment, PÃ©tya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up
 36862	to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice
 36863	that was now deep and now shrill:
 36864	
 36865	âWell, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, itâs as you please,
 36866	but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I
 36867	canât... thatâs all....â
 36868	
 36869	The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and
 36870	turned angrily to her husband.
 36871	
 36872	âThat comes of your talking!â said she.
 36873	
 36874	But the count had already recovered from his excitement.
 36875	
 36876	âCome, come!â said he. âHereâs a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must
 36877	study.â
 36878	
 36879	âItâs not nonsense, Papa. FÃ©dya ObolÃ©nski is younger than I, and heâs
 36880	going too. Besides, all the same I canât study now when...â PÃ©tya
 36881	stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,
 36882	âwhen our Fatherland is in danger.â
 36883	
 36884	âThatâll do, thatâll doânonsense....â
 36885	
 36886	âBut you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.â
 36887	
 36888	âPÃ©tya! Be quiet, I tell you!â cried the count, with a glance at his
 36889	wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.
 36890	
 36891	âAnd I tell youâPeter KirÃ­lych here will also tell you...â
 36892	
 36893	âNonsense, I tell you. Your motherâs milk has hardly dried on your lips
 36894	and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,â and the
 36895	count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread
 36896	them in his study before having a nap.
 36897	
 36898	âWell, Peter KirÃ­lych, letâs go and have a smoke,â he said.
 36899	
 36900	Pierre was agitated and undecided. NatÃ¡shaâs unwontedly brilliant eyes,
 36901	continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced
 36902	him to this condition.
 36903	
 36904	âNo, I think Iâll go home.â
 36905	
 36906	âHome? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You donât
 36907	often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,â said the count
 36908	good-naturedly, pointing to NatÃ¡sha, âonly brightens up when youâre
 36909	here.â
 36910	
 36911	âYes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...â said
 36912	Pierre hurriedly.
 36913	
 36914	âWell, then, au revoir!â said the count, and went out of the room.
 36915	
 36916	âWhy are you going? Why are you upset?â asked NatÃ¡sha, and she looked
 36917	challengingly into Pierreâs eyes.
 36918	
 36919	âBecause I love you!â was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it,
 36920	and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.
 36921	
 36922	âBecause it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply
 36923	I have business....â
 36924	
 36925	âWhy? No, tell me!â NatÃ¡sha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.
 36926	
 36927	They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried
 36928	to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently
 36929	kissed her hand and went out.
 36930	
 36931	Pierre made up his mind not to go to the RostÃ³vsâ any more.

 36937	CHAPTER XXI
 36938	
 36939	After the definite refusal he had received, PÃ©tya went to his room
 36940	and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea,
 36941	silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to
 36942	notice anything.
 36943	
 36944	Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the RostÃ³vsâ
 36945	domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That
 36946	morning PÃ©tya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and
 36947	collar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass,
 36948	gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word
 36949	to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to
 36950	avoid notice. PÃ©tya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and
 36951	to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor
 36952	to be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count RostÃ³v,
 36953	in spite of his youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be
 36954	no hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While
 36955	dressing, PÃ©tya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the
 36956	gentleman-in-waiting.
 36957	
 36958	It was on the very fact of being so young that PÃ©tya counted for success
 36959	in reaching the Emperorâhe even thought how surprised everyone would be
 36960	at his youthfulnessâand yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair
 36961	and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man.
 36962	But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the
 36963	ever-increasing crowds moving toward the KrÃ©mlin, the less he remembered
 36964	to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached
 36965	the KrÃ©mlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck
 36966	out his elbows in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he
 36967	was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the
 36968	patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
 36969	determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,
 36970	rumbling beneath the archway. Beside PÃ©tya stood a peasant woman, a
 36971	footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some
 36972	time in the gateway, PÃ©tya tried to move forward in front of the others
 36973	without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began resolutely
 36974	working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in front of him, who
 36975	was the first against whom he directed his efforts, angrily shouted at
 36976	him:
 36977	
 36978	âWhat are you shoving for, young lordling? Donât you see weâre all
 36979	standing still? Then why push?â
 36980	
 36981	âAnybody can shove,â said the footman, and also began working his elbows
 36982	to such effect that he pushed PÃ©tya into a very filthy corner of the
 36983	gateway.
 36984	
 36985	PÃ©tya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp
 36986	collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a manâs.
 36987	
 36988	He felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were
 36989	now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be
 36990	admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up
 36991	or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who
 36992	drove past was an acquaintance of the RostÃ³vsâ, and PÃ©tya thought of
 36993	asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a
 36994	manly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd,
 36995	carrying PÃ©tya with it, streamed forward into the KrÃ©mlin Square which
 36996	was already full of people. There were people not only in the square,
 36997	but everywhereâon the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as PÃ©tya found
 36998	himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous
 36999	voices of the crowd that filled the whole KrÃ©mlin.
 37000	
 37001	For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared,
 37002	and everyone rushed forward in one direction. PÃ©tya was being pressed so
 37003	that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, âHurrah! hurrah!
 37004	hurrah!â PÃ©tya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see
 37005	nothing except the people about him.
 37006	
 37007	All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A
 37008	tradesmanâs wife standing beside PÃ©tya sobbed, and the tears ran down
 37009	her cheeks.
 37010	
 37011	âFather! Angel! Dear one!â she kept repeating, wiping away her tears
 37012	with her fingers.
 37013	
 37014	âHurrah!â was heard on all sides.
 37015	
 37016	For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush
 37017	forward.
 37018	
 37019	Quite beside himself, PÃ©tya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes
 37020	ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting âhurrah!â as
 37021	if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but
 37022	on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed
 37023	forward and everybody shouted âhurrah!â
 37024	
 37025	âSo this is what the Emperor is!â thought PÃ©tya. âNo, I canât petition
 37026	him myselfâthat would be too bold.â But in spite of this he continued
 37027	to struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those
 37028	in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth
 37029	spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed backâthe police
 37030	in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the
 37031	procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of
 37032	the Assumptionâand PÃ©tya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side
 37033	and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim
 37034	before his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a
 37035	man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of
 37036	his head and wearing a shabby blue cassockâprobably a church clerk and
 37037	chanterâwas holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off
 37038	the pressure of the crowd with the other.
 37039	
 37040	âYouâve crushed the young gentleman!â said the clerk. âWhat are you up
 37041	to? Gently!... Theyâve crushed him, crushed him!â
 37042	
 37043	The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread
 37044	out again more evenly, and the clerk led PÃ©tyaâpale and breathlessâto
 37045	the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for PÃ©tya, and suddenly a
 37046	crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest
 37047	him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised
 37048	platform of the cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might
 37049	be) who had crushed him.
 37050	
 37051	âOne might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing
 37052	people! Poor dear, heâs as white as a sheet!ââvarious voices were heard
 37053	saying.
 37054	
 37055	PÃ©tya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had
 37056	passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained
 37057	a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who
 37058	would be returning that way. PÃ©tya no longer thought of presenting his
 37059	petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy!
 37060	
 37061	While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumptionâit
 37062	was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperorâs
 37063	arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the
 37064	Turksâthe crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling kvass,
 37065	gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which PÃ©tya was particularly
 37066	fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A tradesmanâs
 37067	wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had
 37068	cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk
 37069	who had rescued PÃ©tya was talking to a functionary about the priests who
 37070	were officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used
 37071	the word âplenaryâ (of the service), a word PÃ©tya did not understand.
 37072	Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking
 37073	nuts. All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls,
 37074	were such as might have had a particular charm for PÃ©tya at his age, but
 37075	they did not interest him now. He sat on his elevationâthe pedestal of
 37076	the cannonâstill agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by
 37077	his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when
 37078	he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still further
 37079	intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.
 37080	
 37081	Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment,
 37082	to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed
 37083	impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing. PÃ©tya too would
 37084	have run there, but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under
 37085	his protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding when
 37086	officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the
 37087	cathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were
 37088	again raised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back
 37089	again. At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the
 37090	cathedral doors. âHurrah! hurrah!â shouted the crowd again.
 37091	
 37092	âWhich is he? Which?â asked PÃ©tya in a tearful voice, of those around
 37093	him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and PÃ©tya,
 37094	fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the
 37095	tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm
 37096	on himâthough it happened not to be the Emperorâfrantically shouted
 37097	âHurrah!â and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the
 37098	army.
 37099	
 37100	The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began
 37101	to disperse. It was already late, and PÃ©tya had not eaten anything and
 37102	was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with
 37103	that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while
 37104	the Emperor dinedâlooking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew
 37105	not what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance
 37106	to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table,
 37107	glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows.
 37108	
 37109	While the Emperor was dining, ValÃºev, looking out of the window, said:
 37110	
 37111	âThe people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.â
 37112	
 37113	The dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose
 37114	and went out onto the balcony. The people, with PÃ©tya among them, rushed
 37115	toward the balcony.
 37116	
 37117	âAngel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...â cried the crowd, and PÃ©tya with
 37118	it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, PÃ©tya among them, wept
 37119	with joy.
 37120	
 37121	A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke
 37122	off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A coachman in
 37123	a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several
 37124	people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had
 37125	a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from
 37126	the balcony. PÃ©tyaâs eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the
 37127	danger of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why,
 37128	but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsarâs hand and he felt that he
 37129	must not give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was
 37130	catching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated
 37131	though she was lying on the groundâshe grabbed at some biscuits but
 37132	her hand did not reach them. PÃ©tya pushed her hand away with his knee,
 37133	seized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted
 37134	âHurrah!â with a voice already hoarse.
 37135	
 37136	The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began
 37137	to disperse.
 37138	
 37139	âThere! I said if only we waitedâand so it was!â was being joyfully said
 37140	by various people.
 37141	
 37142	Happy as PÃ©tya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all
 37143	the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from
 37144	the KrÃ©mlin, but called on his friend ObolÃ©nski, who was fifteen and was
 37145	also entering the regiment. On returning home PÃ©tya announced resolutely
 37146	and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would
 37147	run away. And next day, Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³vâthough he had not yet quite
 37148	yieldedâwent to inquire how he could arrange for PÃ©tya to serve where
 37149	there would be least danger.
 37150	
 37151	
 37152	
 37153	
 37154	
 37155	CHAPTER XXII
 37156	
 37157	Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages
 37158	were standing outside the SlobÃ³da Palace.
 37159	
 37160	The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in
 37161	their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats
 37162	of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemenâs hall there was
 37163	an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on
 37164	high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor,
 37165	but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.
 37166	
 37167	All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own
 37168	houses, were in uniformâsome in that of Catherineâs day, others in that
 37169	of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexanderâs time or
 37170	the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic
 37171	of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these
 37172	diverse and familiar personalities, both old and young. The old men,
 37173	dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled,
 37174	were especially striking. For the most part they sat quietly in their
 37175	places and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached
 37176	themselves to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces
 37177	of the crowd PÃ©tya had seen in the Square, there was a striking
 37178	contradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event, and at the
 37179	same time the everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook,
 37180	ZinaÃ­da DmÃ­trievnaâs health, and so on.
 37181	
 37182	Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a noblemanâs
 37183	uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated;
 37184	this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the
 37185	merchant-classâles Ã©tats gÃ©nÃ©raux (States-General)âevoked in him a whole
 37186	series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in
 37187	his soul: thoughts of the Contrat Social and the French Revolution. The
 37188	words that had struck him in the Emperorâs appealâthat the sovereign was
 37189	coming to the capital for consultation with his peopleâstrengthened this
 37190	idea. And imagining that in this direction something important which
 37191	he had long awaited was drawing near, he strolled about watching and
 37192	listening to conversations, but nowhere finding any confirmation of the
 37193	ideas that occupied him.
 37194	
 37195	The Emperorâs manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved
 37196	about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre
 37197	heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when
 37198	the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperorâs
 37199	honor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole
 37200	provinces... and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or
 37201	what the nobility had been convened for, the talk became undecided and
 37202	indefinite. Then all preferred listening to speaking.
 37203	
 37204	A middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired
 37205	naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was
 37206	pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round
 37207	the speaker and listened. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, in a military uniform of
 37208	Catherineâs time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd,
 37209	with all of whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and
 37210	listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did,
 37211	to what the speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very
 37212	boldly, as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners
 37213	and from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and
 37214	quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement
 37215	with him. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group, listened,
 37216	and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal, but of views
 37217	quite different from his own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly
 37218	sonorous, musical, and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly
 37219	swallowing his râs and generally slurring his consonants: the voice of
 37220	a man calling out to his servant, âHeah! Bwing me my pipe!â It was
 37221	indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority.
 37222	
 37223	âWhat if the SmolÃ©nsk people have offahd to waise militia for the
 37224	Empewah? Ah we to take SmolÃ©nsk as our patteân? If the noble awistocwacy
 37225	of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our
 37226	sovâweign the Empewah in other ways. Have we foâgotten the waising of
 37227	the militia in the yeah âseven? All that did was to enwich the pwiestsâ
 37228	sons and thieves and wobbahs....â
 37229	
 37230	Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v smiled blandly and nodded approval.
 37231	
 37232	âAnd was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined
 37233	our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... oâ ouâ men will wetuân
 37234	neithah soldiers noâ peasants, and weâll get only depwavity fwom them.
 37235	The nobility donât gwudge theah livesâevewy one of us will go and bwing
 37236	in more wecwuits, and the sovâweignâ (that was the way he referred to
 37237	the Emperor) âneed only say the word and weâll all die foâ him!â added
 37238	the orator with animation.
 37239	
 37240	Count RostÃ³vâs mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but
 37241	Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,
 37242	but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he
 37243	opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his
 37244	head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first
 37245	speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and
 37246	to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:
 37247	
 37248	âI imagine, sir,â said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, âthat we
 37249	have been summoned here not to discuss whether itâs best for the empire
 37250	at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia.
 37251	We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign
 37252	the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what is bestâconscription or
 37253	the militiaâwe can leave to the supreme authority....â
 37254	
 37255	Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart
 37256	against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude
 37257	into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and
 37258	interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he
 37259	began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing
 37260	himself in bookish Russian.
 37261	
 37262	âExcuse me, your excellency,â he began. (He was well acquainted with
 37263	the senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him
 37264	formally.) âThough I donât agree with the gentleman...â (he hesitated:
 37265	he wished to say, âMon trÃ¨s honorable prÃ©opinantâââMy very honorable
 37266	opponentâ) âwith the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing,
 37267	I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express
 37268	their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which
 37269	we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,â he went on, warming to his
 37270	subject, âthat the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us
 37271	merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, and
 37272	chair Ã  canon * we are ready to make of ourselvesâand not to obtain from
 37273	us any co-co-counsel.â
 37274	
 37275	    * âFood for cannon.â
 37276	
 37277	
 37278	Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senatorâs sarcastic
 37279	smile and the freedom of Pierreâs remarks. Only Count RostÃ³v was pleased
 37280	with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the
 37281	senator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.
 37282	
 37283	âI think that before discussing these questions,â Pierre continued, âwe
 37284	should ask the Emperorâmost respectfully ask His Majestyâto let us know
 37285	the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our
 37286	forces now are, and then...â
 37287	
 37288	But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from
 37289	three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance,
 37290	a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him, StepÃ¡n
 37291	StepÃ¡novich AdrÃ¡ksin. AdrÃ¡ksin was in uniform, and whether as a result
 37292	of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a
 37293	different man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face,
 37294	AdrÃ¡ksin shouted at Pierre:
 37295	
 37296	âIn the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor
 37297	about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the
 37298	Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are moved
 37299	according to the enemyâs movements and the number of men increases and
 37300	decreases....â
 37301	
 37302	Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years
 37303	of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsiesâ and knew as a bad
 37304	cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre,
 37305	interrupted AdrÃ¡ksin.
 37306	
 37307	âYes, and this is not a time for discussing,â he continued, âbut for
 37308	acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy
 37309	Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives
 37310	and children.â The nobleman smote his breast. âWe will all arise,
 37311	everyone of us will go, for our father the Tsar!â he shouted, rolling
 37312	his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd.
 37313	âWe are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith,
 37314	the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of
 37315	our Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of
 37316	Russia!â
 37317	
 37318	Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his
 37319	words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the
 37320	sound of his opponentâs voice.
 37321	
 37322	Count RostÃ³v at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several
 37323	persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a
 37324	phrase, said:
 37325	
 37326	âThatâs right, quite right! Just so!â
 37327	
 37328	Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his
 37329	serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in
 37330	order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices
 37331	shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count RostÃ³v had not time
 37332	to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed,
 37333	re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and
 37334	to the big table. Not only was Pierreâs attempt to speak unsuccessful,
 37335	but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away
 37336	from him as from a common enemy. This happened not because they were
 37337	displeased by the substance of his speech, which had even been forgotten
 37338	after the many subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a
 37339	tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the
 37340	latter. Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in
 37341	the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.
 37342	
 37343	GlÃ­nka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries
 37344	of âauthor! author!â were heard in the crowd), said that âhell must be
 37345	repulsed by hell,â and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning
 37346	flashes and thunderclaps, but âwe will not be that child.â
 37347	
 37348	âYes, yes, at thunderclaps!â was repeated approvingly in the back rows
 37349	of the crowd.
 37350	
 37351	The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald
 37352	seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed, almost all of whom
 37353	Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing
 37354	boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced
 37355	to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the
 37356	chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together.
 37357	Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened
 37358	to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find
 37359	some thought and hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre
 37360	knew, sat and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their
 37361	faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very
 37362	hot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general desire to show that
 37363	they were ready to go to all lengthsâwhich found expression in the tones
 37364	and looks more than in the substance of the speechesâinfected him too.
 37365	He did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame
 37366	and wished to justify himself.
 37367	
 37368	âI only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices
 37369	when we know what is needed!â said he, trying to be heard above the
 37370	other voices.
 37371	
 37372	One of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was
 37373	immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.
 37374	
 37375	âYes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!â shouted
 37376	one man.
 37377	
 37378	âHe is the enemy of mankind!â cried another. âAllow me to speak....â
 37379	âGentlemen, you are crushing me!...â
 37380	
 37381	
 37382	
 37383	
 37384	
 37385	CHAPTER XXIII
 37386	
 37387	At that moment Count RostopchÃ­n with his protruding chin and alert eyes,
 37388	wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered
 37389	the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.
 37390	
 37391	âOur sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,â said RostopchÃ­n.
 37392	âI am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think
 37393	there is little need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon
 37394	us and the merchants. Millions will pour forth from thereââhe pointed
 37395	to the merchantsâ hallââbut our business is to supply men and not spare
 37396	ourselves.... That is the least we can do!â
 37397	
 37398	A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table.
 37399	The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding
 37400	noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another, âI
 37401	agree,â or for variety, âI too am of that opinion,â and so on had even a
 37402	mournful effect.
 37403	
 37404	The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow
 37405	nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped,
 37406	out of every thousand serfs, as the SmolÃ©nsk gentry had done. Their
 37407	chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose
 37408	with apparent relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to
 37409	stretch their legs and converse in couples.
 37410	
 37411	âThe Emperor! The Emperor!â a sudden cry resounded through the halls and
 37412	the whole throng hurried to the entrance.
 37413	
 37414	The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of
 37415	nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre
 37416	stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From
 37417	what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger
 37418	threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow
 37419	nobility. He was answered by a voice which informed him of the
 37420	resolution just arrived at.
 37421	
 37422	âGentlemen!â said the Emperor with a quivering voice.
 37423	
 37424	There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that
 37425	Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying
 37426	with emotion:
 37427	
 37428	âI never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has
 37429	surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland!
 37430	Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious....â
 37431	
 37432	The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and
 37433	rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.
 37434	
 37435	âYes, most precious... a royal word,â said Count RostÃ³v, with a sob. He
 37436	stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood
 37437	everything in his own way.
 37438	
 37439	From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants.
 37440	There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him
 37441	come out from the merchantsâ hall with tears of emotion in his eyes.
 37442	As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants
 37443	before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling
 37444	voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two
 37445	merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshchÃ­k. The other was
 37446	the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were
 37447	weeping. Tears filled the thin manâs eyes, and the fat otkupshchÃ­k
 37448	sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating:
 37449	
 37450	âOur lives and propertyâtake them, Your Majesty!â
 37451	
 37452	Pierreâs one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was
 37453	ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now
 37454	felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought
 37455	an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count MamÃ³nov was
 37456	furnishing a regiment, BezÃºkhov at once informed RostopchÃ­n that he
 37457	would give a thousand men and their maintenance.
 37458	
 37459	Old RostÃ³v could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and
 37460	at once consented to PÃ©tyaâs request and went himself to enter his name.
 37461	
 37462	Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took off
 37463	their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs, and not
 37464	without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment,
 37465	feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.

 37477	CHAPTER I
 37478	
 37479	Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going
 37480	to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he
 37481	received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the
 37482	stimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain from
 37483	bursts of anger in the presence of KurÃ¡kin and then of BalashÃ«v.
 37484	
 37485	Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally
 37486	insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best
 37487	way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great
 37488	commander. RostÃ³v charged the French because he could not restrain
 37489	his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same way the
 37490	innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their
 37491	personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and aims. They were
 37492	moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining
 37493	that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will,
 37494	but they all were involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work
 37495	concealed from them but comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable
 37496	fate of men of action, and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy
 37497	the less are they free.
 37498	
 37499	The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal
 37500	interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that
 37501	time but its historic results.
 37502	
 37503	Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to
 37504	further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all
 37505	expectedâneither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those
 37506	who did the actual fighting.
 37507	
 37508	The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us
 37509	now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance
 37510	into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for
 37511	a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war
 37512	by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused
 37513	among the Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems
 37514	so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand
 37515	menâthe best in the world and led by the best generalâcould be destroyed
 37516	in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by
 37517	inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was. Not only did no one
 37518	see this, but on the Russian side every effort was made to hinder the
 37519	only thing that could save Russia, while on the French side, despite
 37520	Napoleonâs experience and so-called military genius, every effort was
 37521	directed to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to
 37522	doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction.
 37523	
 37524	In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of
 37525	saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he
 37526	sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at SmolÃ©nsk,
 37527	and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign
 37528	was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling
 37529	us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was
 37530	adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some
 37531	of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to
 37532	Toll, and others again to Alexander himselfâpointing to notes, projects,
 37533	and letters which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these
 37534	hints at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are
 37535	advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that event not
 37536	occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the
 37537	thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary
 37538	which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event
 37539	falsified them. There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of
 37540	any event that however it may end there will always be people to say:
 37541	âI said then that it would be so,â quite forgetting that amid their
 37542	innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.
 37543	
 37544	Conjectures as to Napoleonâs awareness of the danger of extending his
 37545	line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths
 37546	of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can
 37547	historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals,
 37548	or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat
 37549	contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war
 37550	not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French
 37551	into the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia
 37552	everything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid
 37553	to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and
 37554	did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.
 37555	
 37556	At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole
 37557	aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we
 37558	meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our
 37559	Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian
 37560	soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuelâs
 37561	plan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor
 37562	reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could
 37563	not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach SmolÃ©nsk, still less
 37564	could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did
 37565	unite he was displeased that SmolÃ©nsk was abandoned and burned without a
 37566	general engagement having been fought under its walls.
 37567	
 37568	So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still
 37569	more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the
 37570	depths of the country.
 37571	
 37572	Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and
 37573	missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at
 37574	SmolÃ©nsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now
 37575	see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.
 37576	
 37577	The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the
 37578	advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then
 37579	think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of
 37580	Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan,
 37581	for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex
 37582	interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in
 37583	the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one
 37584	way of saving Russia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies
 37585	were divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite
 37586	them, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the
 37587	enemyâs advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle
 37588	with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at
 37589	an acute angleâwe led the French on to SmolÃ©nsk. But we withdrew at an
 37590	acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies;
 37591	the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because
 37592	Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by BagratiÃ³n (who
 37593	would come under his command), and BagratiÃ³nâbeing in command of the
 37594	second armyâtried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclayâs
 37595	command as long as he could. BagratiÃ³n was slow in effecting the
 37596	junctionâthough that was the chief aim of all at headquartersâbecause,
 37597	as he alleged, he exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was
 37598	best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying
 37599	the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for
 37600	his army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under
 37601	the command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior
 37602	to his own.
 37603	
 37604	The Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence and
 37605	ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of advisers and
 37606	plans, destroyed the first armyâs energy and it retired.
 37607	
 37608	The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci,
 37609	aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy
 37610	to influence Alexander, and Pfuelâs whole plan was abandoned and the
 37611	command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence
 37612	his power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of
 37613	command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division,
 37614	and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted
 37615	on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could
 37616	not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else,
 37617	instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing
 37618	indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.
 37619	
 37620	At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed
 37621	the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary
 37622	for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in
 37623	general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow
 37624	the strength of the Russian army was trebled.
 37625	
 37626	He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chiefâs undivided
 37627	control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then
 37628	be taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and
 37629	enfeebled. Bennigsen, the TsarÃ©vich, and a swarm of adjutants general
 37630	remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation
 37631	and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under
 37632	the observation of all these âeyes of the Emperor,â became still more
 37633	cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.
 37634	
 37635	Barclay stood for caution. The TsarÃ©vich hinted at treachery and
 37636	demanded a general engagement. LubomÃ­rski, BronnÃ­tski, Wlocki, and the
 37637	others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under
 37638	pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish
 37639	adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with
 37640	Bennigsen and the TsarÃ©vich.
 37641	
 37642	At SmolÃ©nsk the armies at last reunited, much as BagratiÃ³n disliked it.
 37643	
 37644	BagratiÃ³n drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay.
 37645	Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior
 37646	officer BagratiÃ³n.
 37647	
 37648	Despite his seniority in rank BagratiÃ³n, in this contest of magnanimity,
 37649	took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed with him
 37650	less than ever. By the Emperorâs orders BagratiÃ³n reported direct to
 37651	him. He wrote to ArakchÃ©ev, the Emperorâs confidant: âIt must be as
 37652	my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with the Minister (meaning
 37653	Barclay). For Godâs sake send me somewhere else if only in command of
 37654	a regiment. I cannot stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans
 37655	that a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought
 37656	I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out
 37657	that I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not want to.â
 37658	
 37659	The swarm of BronnÃ­tskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further
 37660	embittered the relations between the commanders in chief, and even
 37661	less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the French before
 37662	SmolÃ©nsk. A general was sent to survey the position. This general,
 37663	hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander,
 37664	and, having spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned,
 37665	as unsuitable from every point of view, the battleground he had not
 37666	seen.
 37667	
 37668	While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of
 37669	battle, and while we were looking for the Frenchâhaving lost touch with
 37670	themâthe French stumbled upon NevÃ©rovskiâs division and reached the
 37671	walls of SmolÃ©nsk.
 37672	
 37673	It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at SmolÃ©nsk to save our
 37674	lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were killed
 37675	on both sides.
 37676	
 37677	SmolÃ©nsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the
 37678	whole people. But SmolÃ©nsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had
 37679	been misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting
 37680	an example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own
 37681	losses but kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther and we
 37682	retired, thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction.
 37683	
 37684	
 37685	
 37686	
 37687	
 37688	CHAPTER II
 37689	
 37690	The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary
 37691	to come to his study.
 37692	
 37693	âWell? Are you satisfied now?â said he. âYouâve made me quarrel with my
 37694	son! Satisfied, are you? Thatâs all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts
 37695	me, it hurts. Iâm old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then,
 37696	gloat over it! Gloat over it!â
 37697	
 37698	After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was
 37699	ill and did not leave his study.
 37700	
 37701	Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the
 37702	old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit
 37703	Mademoiselle Bourienne either. TÃ­khon alone attended him.
 37704	
 37705	At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way
 37706	of life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations
 37707	and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his
 37708	relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold tone to his
 37709	daughter seemed to say: âThere, you see? You plotted against me, you
 37710	lied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made
 37711	me quarrel with him, but you see I need neither her nor you!â
 37712	
 37713	Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching
 37714	his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to
 37715	Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her old
 37716	nurse, or with âGodâs folkâ who sometimes came by the back door to see
 37717	her.
 37718	
 37719	Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She
 37720	feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at
 37721	the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did not
 37722	understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her like all
 37723	previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this war, though
 37724	Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested
 37725	in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her,
 37726	and though the âGodâs folkâ who came to see her reported, in their own
 37727	way, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist,
 37728	and though Julie (now Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya), who had resumed
 37729	correspondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.
 37730	
 37731	âI write you in Russian, my good friend,â wrote Julie in her Frenchified
 37732	Russian, âbecause I have a detestation for all the French, and the
 37733	same for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in
 37734	Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.
 37735	
 37736	âMy poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the
 37737	news which I have inspires me yet more.
 37738	
 37739	âYou heard probably of the heroic exploit of RaÃ©vski, embracing his two
 37740	sons and saying: âI will perish with them but we will not be shaken!â
 37741	And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were
 37742	unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The
 37743	princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy
 37744	widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie, only
 37745	you, my friend, are missing...â and so on.
 37746	
 37747	The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of
 37748	this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize
 37749	it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.
 37750	The princeâs tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary
 37751	unhesitatingly believed him.
 37752	
 37753	All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated.
 37754	He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic
 37755	serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that
 37756	he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual,
 37757	changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp
 37758	bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the
 37759	couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without
 37760	undressing, whileâinstead of Mademoiselle Bourienneâa serf boy read to
 37761	him. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.
 37762	
 37763	On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his
 37764	first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had
 37765	dutifully asked his fatherâs forgiveness for what he had allowed himself
 37766	to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old
 37767	prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the
 37768	Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrewâs second letter, written near
 37769	VÃ­tebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of
 37770	the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts
 37771	as to the further progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew
 37772	pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near
 37773	the theater of war and on the armyâs direct line of march, and advised
 37774	him to move to Moscow.
 37775	
 37776	At dinner that day, on Dessallesâ mentioning that the French were said
 37777	to have already entered VÃ­tebsk, the old prince remembered his sonâs
 37778	letter.
 37779	
 37780	âThere was a letter from Prince Andrew today,â he said to Princess
 37781	MaryââHavenât you read it?â
 37782	
 37783	âNo, Father,â she replied in a frightened voice.
 37784	
 37785	She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
 37786	arrived.
 37787	
 37788	âHe writes about this war,â said the prince, with the ironic smile that
 37789	had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.
 37790	
 37791	âThat must be very interesting,â said Dessalles. âPrince Andrew is in a
 37792	position to know...â
 37793	
 37794	âOh, very interesting!â said Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 37795	
 37796	âGo and get it for me,â said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 37797	âYou knowâunder the paperweight on the little table.â
 37798	
 37799	Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.
 37800	
 37801	âNo, donât!â he exclaimed with a frown. âYou go, Michael IvÃ¡novich.â
 37802	
 37803	Michael IvÃ¡novich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left
 37804	the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin
 37805	and went himself.
 37806	
 37807	âThey canât do anything... always make some muddle,â he muttered.
 37808	
 37809	While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and
 37810	even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned
 37811	with quick steps, accompanied by Michael IvÃ¡novich, bringing the letter
 37812	and a plan. These he put down beside himânot letting anyone read them at
 37813	dinner.
 37814	
 37815	On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and,
 37816	spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his
 37817	eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so
 37818	Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the
 37819	plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.
 37820	
 37821	âWhat do you think of it, Prince?â Dessalles ventured to ask.
 37822	
 37823	âI? I?...â said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking
 37824	his eyes from the plan of the building.
 37825	
 37826	âVery possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...â
 37827	
 37828	âHa ha ha! The theater of war!â said the prince. âI have said and still
 37829	say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get
 37830	beyond the Niemen.â
 37831	
 37832	Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the
 37833	Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary,
 37834	forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what
 37835	her father was saying was correct.
 37836	
 37837	âWhen the snow melts theyâll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they
 37838	could fail to see it,â the prince continued, evidently thinking of the
 37839	campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. âBennigsen should have
 37840	advanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different
 37841	turn...â
 37842	
 37843	âBut, Prince,â Dessalles began timidly, âthe letter mentions
 37844	VÃ­tebsk....â
 37845	
 37846	âAh, the letter? Yes...â replied the prince peevishly. âYes... yes...â
 37847	His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. âYes, he
 37848	writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?â
 37849	
 37850	Dessalles dropped his eyes.
 37851	
 37852	âThe prince says nothing about that,â he remarked gently.
 37853	
 37854	âDoesnât he? But I didnât invent it myself.â
 37855	
 37856	No one spoke for a long time.
 37857	
 37858	âYes... yes... Well, Michael IvÃ¡novich,â he suddenly went on, raising
 37859	his head and pointing to the plan of the building, âtell me how you mean
 37860	to alter it....â
 37861	
 37862	Michael IvÃ¡novich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to
 37863	him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and
 37864	went to his own room.
 37865	
 37866	Princess Mary saw Dessallesâ embarrassed and astonished look fixed on
 37867	her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her
 37868	father had forgotten his sonâs letter on the drawing room table; but she
 37869	was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his
 37870	confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think about it.
 37871	
 37872	In the evening Michael IvÃ¡novich, sent by the prince, came to Princess
 37873	Mary for Prince Andrewâs letter which had been forgotten in the drawing
 37874	room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so,
 37875	ventured to ask him what her father was doing.
 37876	
 37877	âAlways busy,â replied Michael IvÃ¡novich with a respectfully ironic
 37878	smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. âHeâs worrying very much
 37879	about the new building. He has been reading a little, but nowââMichael
 37880	IvÃ¡novich went on, lowering his voiceâânow heâs at his desk, busy with
 37881	his will, I expect.â (One of the princeâs favorite occupations of late
 37882	had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death
 37883	and which he called his âwill.â)
 37884	
 37885	âAnd AlpÃ¡tych is being sent to SmolÃ©nsk?â asked Princess Mary.
 37886	
 37887	âOh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.â
 37888	
 37889	
 37890	
 37891	
 37892	
 37893	CHAPTER III
 37894	
 37895	When Michael IvÃ¡novich returned to the study with the letter, the old
 37896	prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his
 37897	open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched
 37898	hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscriptâhis
 37899	âRemarksâ as he termed itâwhich was to be transmitted to the Emperor
 37900	after his death.
 37901	
 37902	When Michael IvÃ¡novich went in there were tears in the princeâs eyes
 37903	evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had
 37904	been written. He took the letter from Michael IvÃ¡novichâs hand, put it
 37905	in his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in AlpÃ¡tych who had long
 37906	been waiting.
 37907	
 37908	The prince had a list of things to be bought in SmolÃ©nsk and, walking
 37909	up and down the room past AlpÃ¡tych who stood by the door, he gave his
 37910	instructions.
 37911	
 37912	âFirst, notepaperâdo you hear? Eight quires, like this sample,
 37913	gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax,
 37914	as in Michael IvÃ¡novichâs list.â
 37915	
 37916	He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.
 37917	
 37918	âThen hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.â
 37919	
 37920	Next, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be
 37921	of a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case
 37922	had to be ordered to keep the âwillâ in.
 37923	
 37924	The instructions to AlpÃ¡tych took over two hours and still the prince
 37925	did not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and
 37926	dozed off. AlpÃ¡tych made a slight movement.
 37927	
 37928	âWell, go, go! If anything more is wanted Iâll send after you.â
 37929	
 37930	AlpÃ¡tych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it,
 37931	fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table
 37932	to write to the governor.
 37933	
 37934	It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished
 37935	to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
 37936	thoughts came to him in bed. So he called TÃ­khon and went through the
 37937	rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.
 37938	
 37939	He went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed
 37940	unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.
 37941	That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive
 37942	thoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere,
 37943	but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than
 37944	other places: he had never slept there yet.
 37945	
 37946	With the help of a footman TÃ­khon brought in the bedstead and began
 37947	putting it up.
 37948	
 37949	âThatâs not right! Thatâs not right!â cried the prince, and himself
 37950	pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.
 37951	
 37952	âWell, at last Iâve finished, now Iâll rest,â thought the prince, and
 37953	let TÃ­khon undress him.
 37954	
 37955	Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his
 37956	coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the
 37957	bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his
 37958	withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the
 37959	moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the
 37960	bed. âUgh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would
 37961	release me!â thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that effort
 37962	for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had he done so
 37963	before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if
 37964	it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened to him almost every
 37965	night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.
 37966	
 37967	âNo peace, damn them!â he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. âAh
 37968	yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was
 37969	keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them.
 37970	No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary
 37971	talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in
 37972	my pocketâcanât remember....â
 37973	
 37974	âTÃ­khon, what did we talk about at dinner?â
 37975	
 37976	âAbout Prince Michael...â
 37977	
 37978	âBe quiet, quiet!â The prince slapped his hand on the table. âYes, I
 37979	know, Prince Andrewâs letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said
 37980	something about VÃ­tebsk. Now Iâll read it.â
 37981	
 37982	He had the letter taken from his pocket and the tableâon which stood a
 37983	glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candleâmoved close to the bed, and
 37984	putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness of
 37985	the night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he
 37986	grasp its meaning for a moment.
 37987	
 37988	âThe French at VÃ­tebsk, in four daysâ march they may be at SmolÃ©nsk;
 37989	perhaps are already there! TÃ­khon!â TÃ­khon jumped up. âNo, no, I donât
 37990	want anything!â he shouted.
 37991	
 37992	He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there
 37993	rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian
 37994	camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face,
 37995	vigorous and alert, entering PotÃ«mkinâs gaily colored tent, and a
 37996	burning sense of jealousy of âthe favoriteâ agitated him now as strongly
 37997	as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that
 37998	first meeting with PotÃ«mkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather
 37999	sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile
 38000	and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same
 38001	face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with ZÃºbov over her
 38002	coffin about his right to kiss her hand.
 38003	
 38004	âOh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all
 38005	the present! Quicker, quickerâand that they should leave me in peace!â
 38006	
 38007	
 38008	
 38009	
 38010	
 38011	CHAPTER IV
 38012	
 38013	Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nskiâs estate, lay forty miles east
 38014	from SmolÃ©nsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.
 38015	
 38016	The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to AlpÃ¡tych,
 38017	Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the
 38018	prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety,
 38019	though from Prince Andrewâs letter it was evident that to remain at Bald
 38020	Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter
 38021	by AlpÃ¡tych to the Provincial Governor at SmolÃ©nsk, asking him to let
 38022	her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which
 38023	Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor
 38024	for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to AlpÃ¡tych with
 38025	instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as
 38026	possible if there was danger.
 38027	
 38028	Having received all his orders AlpÃ¡tych, wearing a white beaver hatâa
 38029	present from the princeâand carrying a stick as the prince did, went out
 38030	accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to
 38031	a small conveyance with a leather hood.
 38032	
 38033	The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed
 38034	with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with
 38035	ringing bells; but on a long journey AlpÃ¡tych liked to have them. His
 38036	satellitesâthe senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid,
 38037	a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various
 38038	domestic serfsâwere seeing him off.
 38039	
 38040	His daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and
 38041	behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one
 38042	of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.
 38043	
 38044	âThere! There! Womenâs fuss! Women, women!â said AlpÃ¡tych, puffing and
 38045	speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap.
 38046	
 38047	After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, AlpÃ¡tych, not
 38048	trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and
 38049	crossed himself three times.
 38050	
 38051	âIf there is anything... come back, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych! For Christâs sake
 38052	think of us!â cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the
 38053	enemy.
 38054	
 38055	âWomen, women! Womenâs fuss!â muttered AlpÃ¡tych to himself and started
 38056	on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the
 38057	still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just
 38058	being plowed a second time.
 38059	
 38060	As he went along he looked with pleasure at the yearâs splendid crop
 38061	of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were
 38062	already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the
 38063	harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the
 38064	princeâs orders.
 38065	
 38066	Having baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward
 38067	evening on the fourth of August.
 38068	
 38069	AlpÃ¡tych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the
 38070	road. As he approached SmolÃ©nsk he heard the sounds of distant firing,
 38071	but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a
 38072	splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which
 38073	was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact
 38074	impressed AlpÃ¡tych, but in thinking about his own business he soon
 38075	forgot it.
 38076	
 38077	All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been
 38078	bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit.
 38079	Everything not connected with the execution of the princeâs orders did
 38080	not interest and did not even exist for AlpÃ¡tych.
 38081	
 38082	On reaching SmolÃ©nsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up
 38083	in the GÃ¡china suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by FerapÃ³ntov,
 38084	where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years.
 38085	Some thirty years ago FerapÃ³ntov, by AlpÃ¡tychâs advice, had bought a
 38086	wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an
 38087	inn, and a corn dealerâs shop in that province. He was a stout, dark,
 38088	red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a
 38089	nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.
 38090	
 38091	Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, FerapÃ³ntov was standing
 38092	before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing AlpÃ¡tych he went
 38093	up to him.
 38094	
 38095	âYouâre welcome, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych. Folks are leaving the town, but you
 38096	have come to it,â said he.
 38097	
 38098	âWhy are they leaving the town?â asked AlpÃ¡tych.
 38099	
 38100	âThatâs what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.â
 38101	
 38102	âWomenâs fuss, womenâs fuss!â said AlpÃ¡tych.
 38103	
 38104	âJust what I think, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych. What I say is: orders have been
 38105	given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are
 38106	asking three rubles for cartingâit isnât Christian!â
 38107	
 38108	YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for hay
 38109	for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.
 38110	
 38111	All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning AlpÃ¡tych
 38112	donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a
 38113	sunny morning and by eight oâclock it was already hot. âA good day for
 38114	harvesting,â thought AlpÃ¡tych.
 38115	
 38116	From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight
 38117	oâclock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many
 38118	people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers,
 38119	but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and
 38120	service was being held in the churches as usual. AlpÃ¡tych went to the
 38121	shops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governorâs.
 38122	In the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking
 38123	about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town,
 38124	everybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm
 38125	one another.
 38126	
 38127	In front of the Governorâs house AlpÃ¡tych found a large number of
 38128	people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governorâs. At the
 38129	porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an
 38130	ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:
 38131	
 38132	âItâs no joke, you know! Itâs all very well if youâre single. âOne man
 38133	though undone is but one,â as the proverb says, but with thirteen in
 38134	your family and all the property... Theyâve brought us to utter ruin!
 38135	What sort of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hangedâthe
 38136	brigands!...â
 38137	
 38138	âOh come, thatâs enough!â said the other.
 38139	
 38140	âWhat do I care? Let him hear! Weâre not dogs,â said the ex-captain of
 38141	police, and looking round he noticed AlpÃ¡tych.
 38142	
 38143	âOh, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych! What have you come for?â
 38144	
 38145	âTo see the Governor by his excellencyâs order,â answered AlpÃ¡tych,
 38146	lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his
 38147	coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince.... âHe has ordered
 38148	me to inquire into the position of affairs,â he added.
 38149	
 38150	âYes, go and find out!â shouted the angry gentleman. âTheyâve brought
 38151	things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it
 38152	is again, do you hear?â said he, pointing in the direction whence came
 38153	the sounds of firing.
 38154	
 38155	âTheyâve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!â he repeated, and
 38156	descended the porch steps.
 38157	
 38158	AlpÃ¡tych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were
 38159	tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The
 38160	door of the Governorâs room opened and they all rose and moved forward.
 38161	An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout
 38162	official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished
 38163	again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions
 38164	addressed to him. AlpÃ¡tych moved forward and next time the official came
 38165	out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat,
 38166	and handed him two letters.
 38167	
 38168	âTo his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince BolkÃ³nski,â he
 38169	announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned
 38170	to him and took the letters.
 38171	
 38172	A few minutes later the Governor received AlpÃ¡tych and hurriedly said to
 38173	him:
 38174	
 38175	âInform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the
 38176	highest instructionsâhere...â and he handed a paper to AlpÃ¡tych. âStill,
 38177	as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to Moscow. I am
 38178	just starting myself. Inform them...â
 38179	
 38180	But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the
 38181	room and began to say something in French. The Governorâs face expressed
 38182	terror.
 38183	
 38184	âGo,â he said, nodding his head to AlpÃ¡tych, and began questioning the
 38185	officer.
 38186	
 38187	Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on AlpÃ¡tych when he came
 38188	out of the Governorâs room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing,
 38189	which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, AlpÃ¡tych hurried
 38190	to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:
 38191	
 38192	âI assure you that the town of SmolÃ©nsk is not in the slightest danger
 38193	as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any. I from
 38194	the one side and Prince BagratiÃ³n from the other are marching to unite
 38195	our forces before SmolÃ©nsk, which junction will be effected on the
 38196	22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will defend our
 38197	compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts
 38198	shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last
 38199	warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From this you will see that
 38200	you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of SmolÃ©nsk, for
 38201	those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory.â
 38202	(Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of
 38203	SmolÃ©nsk, 1812.)
 38204	
 38205	People were anxiously roaming about the streets.
 38206	
 38207	Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept
 38208	emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.
 38209	Loaded carts stood at the house next to FerapÃ³ntovâs and women were
 38210	wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round
 38211	barking in front of the harnessed horses.
 38212	
 38213	AlpÃ¡tych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went
 38214	straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was
 38215	asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage.
 38216	From the hostâs room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing
 38217	sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of FerapÃ³ntov. The cook
 38218	began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen,
 38219	just as AlpÃ¡tych entered.
 38220	
 38221	âHeâs done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her
 38222	about so!...â
 38223	
 38224	âWhat for?â asked AlpÃ¡tych.
 38225	
 38226	âShe kept begging to go away. Sheâs a woman! âTake me away,â says she,
 38227	âdonât let me perish with my little children! Folks,â she says, âare all
 38228	gone, so why,â she says, âdonât we go?â And he began beating and pulling
 38229	her about so!â
 38230	
 38231	At these words AlpÃ¡tych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to
 38232	hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeperâs, where
 38233	he had left his purchases.
 38234	
 38235	âYou brute, you murderer!â screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby
 38236	in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the door
 38237	at that moment and down the steps into the yard.
 38238	
 38239	FerapÃ³ntov came out after her, but on seeing AlpÃ¡tych adjusted his
 38240	waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed AlpÃ¡tych into the
 38241	opposite room.
 38242	
 38243	âGoing already?â said he.
 38244	
 38245	AlpÃ¡tych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages
 38246	and asked how much he owed.
 38247	
 38248	âWeâll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governorâs?â asked
 38249	FerapÃ³ntov. âWhat has been decided?â
 38250	
 38251	AlpÃ¡tych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.
 38252	
 38253	âWith our business, how can we get away?â said FerapÃ³ntov. âWeâd have
 38254	to pay seven rubles a cartload to DorogobÃºzh and I tell them theyâre
 38255	not Christians to ask it! SelivÃ¡nov, now, did a good stroke last
 38256	Thursdayâsold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have
 38257	some tea?â he added.
 38258	
 38259	While the horses were being harnessed AlpÃ¡tych and FerapÃ³ntov over their
 38260	tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for
 38261	harvesting.
 38262	
 38263	âWell, it seems to be getting quieter,â remarked FerapÃ³ntov, finishing
 38264	his third cup of tea and getting up. âOurs must have got the best of it.
 38265	The orders were not to let them in. So weâre in force, it seems....
 38266	They say the other day Matthew IvÃ¡nych PlÃ¡tov drove them into the river
 38267	MÃ¡rina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day.â
 38268	
 38269	AlpÃ¡tych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come
 38270	in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and
 38271	bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.
 38272	
 38273	It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the
 38274	other half brightly lit by the sun. AlpÃ¡tych looked out of the window
 38275	and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling
 38276	and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull
 38277	roar that set the windows rattling.
 38278	
 38279	He went out into the street: two men were running past toward the
 38280	bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of
 38281	cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds
 38282	were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the
 38283	town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was
 38284	being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered
 38285	up after four oâclock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of
 38286	this bombardment.
 38287	
 38288	At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused
 38289	curiosity. FerapÃ³ntovâs wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under
 38290	the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate,
 38291	listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.
 38292	
 38293	The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity
 38294	everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over
 38295	their heads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.
 38296	
 38297	âWhat force!â remarked one. âKnocked the roof and ceiling all to
 38298	splinters!â
 38299	
 38300	âRouted up the earth like a pig,â said another.
 38301	
 38302	âThatâs grand, it bucks one up!â laughed the first. âLucky you jumped
 38303	aside, or it would have wiped you out!â
 38304	
 38305	Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen
 38306	on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with
 38307	the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable
 38308	intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over peopleâs heads incessantly,
 38309	but not one fell close by, they all flew over. AlpÃ¡tych was getting into
 38310	his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.
 38311	
 38312	âWhat are you staring at?â he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt,
 38313	with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the
 38314	corner to listen to what was being said.
 38315	
 38316	âWhat marvels!â she exclaimed, but hearing her masterâs voice she turned
 38317	back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.
 38318	
 38319	Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping
 38320	downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the
 38321	street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.
 38322	
 38323	âScoundrel, what are you doing?â shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the
 38324	cook.
 38325	
 38326	At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different
 38327	sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently
 38328	with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her
 38329	wailing.
 38330	
 38331	âOh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Donât let me die! My good
 38332	souls!...â
 38333	
 38334	Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her
 38335	thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.
 38336	AlpÃ¡tych, his coachman, FerapÃ³ntovâs wife and children and the house
 38337	porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the
 38338	whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook, which
 38339	rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress
 38340	rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked
 38341	in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained
 38342	in the street. A shopman who entered told her that her husband had
 38343	gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were fetching the
 38344	wonder-working icon of SmolÃ©nsk.
 38345	
 38346	Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. AlpÃ¡tych left the cellar
 38347	and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was
 38348	clouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon
 38349	shone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush
 38350	seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps,
 38351	the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed
 38352	widespread everywhere. The cookâs moans had now subsided. On two sides
 38353	black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through
 38354	the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in
 38355	different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them
 38356	ran into FerapÃ³ntovâs yard before AlpÃ¡tychâs eyes. AlpÃ¡tych went out
 38357	to the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the
 38358	street.
 38359	
 38360	Noticing him, an officer said: âThe town is being abandoned. Get away,
 38361	get away!â and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:
 38362	
 38363	âIâll teach you to run into the yards!â
 38364	
 38365	AlpÃ¡tych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to
 38366	set off. FerapÃ³ntovâs whole household came out too, following AlpÃ¡tych
 38367	and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly
 38368	began to wail as they looked at the firesâthe smoke and even the flames
 38369	of which could be seen in the failing twilightâand as if in reply the
 38370	same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street.
 38371	Inside the shed AlpÃ¡tych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and
 38372	traces of their horses with trembling hands.
 38373	
 38374	As AlpÃ¡tych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in
 38375	FerapÃ³ntovâs open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and
 38376	knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then FerapÃ³ntov returned
 38377	and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at
 38378	them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs
 38379	and laughter:
 38380	
 38381	âLoot everything, lads! Donât let those devils get it!â he cried, taking
 38382	some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.
 38383	
 38384	Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on
 38385	filling their bags. On seeing AlpÃ¡tych, FerapÃ³ntov turned to him:
 38386	
 38387	âRussia is done for!â he cried. âAlpÃ¡tych, Iâll set the place on fire
 38388	myself. Weâre done for!...â and FerapÃ³ntov ran into the yard.
 38389	
 38390	Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking
 38391	it completely, so that AlpÃ¡tych could not pass out and had to wait.
 38392	FerapÃ³ntovâs wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till
 38393	it was possible to drive out.
 38394	
 38395	Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out
 38396	amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper
 38397	AlpÃ¡tychâs cart and that of the innkeeperâs wife, which were slowly
 38398	moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop.
 38399	In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a
 38400	house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already burning itself
 38401	out. The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now
 38402	suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness
 38403	the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures
 38404	flitted about before the fire, and through the incessant crackling of
 38405	the flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap
 38406	would not be able to move on for some time, AlpÃ¡tych got down and turned
 38407	into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were continually
 38408	rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a
 38409	man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the
 38410	street, while others carried bundles of hay.
 38411	
 38412	AlpÃ¡tych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was
 38413	blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen
 38414	in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The
 38415	crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and AlpÃ¡tych
 38416	watched for it too.
 38417	
 38418	âAlpÃ¡tych!â a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.
 38419	
 38420	âMercy on us! Your excellency!â answered AlpÃ¡tych, immediately
 38421	recognizing the voice of his young prince.
 38422	
 38423	Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking
 38424	at AlpÃ¡tych from the back of the crowd.
 38425	
 38426	âWhy are you here?â he asked.
 38427	
 38428	âYour... your excellency,â stammered AlpÃ¡tych and broke into sobs. âAre
 38429	we really lost? Master!...â
 38430	
 38431	âWhy are you here?â Prince Andrew repeated.
 38432	
 38433	At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young masterâs pale
 38434	worn face. AlpÃ¡tych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it
 38435	was to get away.
 38436	
 38437	âAre we really quite lost, your excellency?â he asked again.
 38438	
 38439	Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee
 38440	began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:
 38441	
 38442	âSmolÃ©nsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy
 38443	within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when
 38444	you will start. Send by special messenger to UsvyÃ¡zh.â
 38445	
 38446	Having written this and given the paper to AlpÃ¡tych, he told him how
 38447	to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the
 38448	boyâs tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before
 38449	he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff
 38450	followed by a suite galloped up to him.
 38451	
 38452	âYou are a colonel?â shouted the chief of staff with a German accent,
 38453	in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. âHouses are set on fire in your
 38454	presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You will answer for
 38455	it!â shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the
 38456	commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army, a place,
 38457	as Berg said, âvery agreeable and well en Ã©vidence.â
 38458	
 38459	Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to
 38460	AlpÃ¡tych.
 38461	
 38462	âSo tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by the
 38463	tenth I donât receive news that they have all got away I shall have to
 38464	throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.â
 38465	
 38466	âPrince,â said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, âI only spoke because
 38467	I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly.... You must
 38468	please excuse me,â he went on apologetically.
 38469	
 38470	Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and
 38471	wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another
 38472	terrible crash and something huge collapsed.
 38473	
 38474	âOu-rou-rou!â yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof
 38475	of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all
 38476	around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted,
 38477	exhausted faces of the spectators.
 38478	
 38479	The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:
 38480	
 38481	âItâs fine, lads! Now itâs raging... Itâs fine!â
 38482	
 38483	âThatâs the owner himself,â cried several voices.
 38484	
 38485	âWell then,â continued Prince Andrew to AlpÃ¡tych, âreport to them as I
 38486	have told youâ; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside
 38487	him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.
 38488	
 38489	
 38490	
 38491	
 38492	
 38493	CHAPTER V
 38494	
 38495	From SmolÃ©nsk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy.
 38496	On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching
 38497	along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and
 38498	drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy clouds
 38499	floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward
 38500	evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist.
 38501	Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was
 38502	scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from
 38503	hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and
 38504	in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the
 38505	road, the highroad along which the troops marched, there was no such
 38506	freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest; the
 38507	dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches
 38508	deep. As soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery and baggage
 38509	wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very
 38510	hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft,
 38511	choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. Some of this dust
 38512	was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a
 38513	cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and
 38514	worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that
 38515	road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and
 38516	through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked
 38517	eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded
 38518	sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless
 38519	atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and
 38520	mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells
 38521	and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.
 38522	
 38523	Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that
 38524	regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving
 38525	and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of SmolÃ©nsk and its
 38526	abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against
 38527	the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the
 38528	affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and
 38529	officers. In the regiment they called him âour prince,â were proud
 38530	of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to those of his
 38531	regiment, to TimÃ³khin and the likeâpeople quite new to him, belonging
 38532	to a different world and who could not know and understand his past. As
 38533	soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the
 38534	staff, he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and
 38535	contemptuous. Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to
 38536	him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself
 38537	to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.
 38538	
 38539	In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to
 38540	Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of SmolÃ©nsk on the sixth
 38541	of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended)
 38542	and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to
 38543	pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled.
 38544	But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to
 38545	think about entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously
 38546	he had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for
 38547	Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince
 38548	Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that
 38549	he must ride there.
 38550	
 38551	He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the
 38552	march, rode to his fatherâs estate where he had been born and spent his
 38553	childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens
 38554	of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden
 38555	beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that
 38556	the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was
 38557	floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeperâs
 38558	lodge. No one was at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door
 38559	stood open. Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and
 38560	horses and calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode
 38561	up to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the
 38562	trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up. He called for
 38563	TarÃ¡s the gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round the corner
 38564	of the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw that the carved garden
 38565	fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with
 38566	the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often
 38567	seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast
 38568	shoe.
 38569	
 38570	He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on
 38571	the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of
 38572	bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.
 38573	
 38574	Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had
 38575	been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of
 38576	the house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at
 38577	one window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran
 38578	into the house. AlpÃ¡tych, having sent his family away, was alone at
 38579	Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On
 38580	hearing that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on
 38581	his nose, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word
 38582	began weeping and kissing Prince Andrewâs knee.
 38583	
 38584	Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report
 38585	on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been
 38586	removed to BoguchÃ¡rovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted
 38587	away. The hay and the spring corn, of which AlpÃ¡tych said there had been
 38588	a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and
 38589	mown down while still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too
 38590	had gone to BoguchÃ¡rovo, only a few remained.
 38591	
 38592	Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:
 38593	
 38594	âWhen did my father and sister leave?â meaning when did they leave for
 38595	Moscow.
 38596	
 38597	AlpÃ¡tych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for
 38598	BoguchÃ¡rovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went
 38599	into details concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.
 38600	
 38601	âAm I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?
 38602	We have still six hundred quarters left,â he inquired.
 38603	
 38604	âWhat am I to say to him?â thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the
 38605	old manâs bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on
 38606	his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions
 38607	were and only asked them to allay his grief.
 38608	
 38609	âYes, let them have it,â replied Prince Andrew.
 38610	
 38611	âIf you noticed some disorder in the garden,â said AlpÃ¡tych, âit was
 38612	impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent
 38613	the night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their
 38614	commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.â
 38615	
 38616	âWell, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy
 38617	occupies the place?â asked Prince Andrew.
 38618	
 38619	AlpÃ¡tych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly
 38620	with a solemn gesture raised his arm.
 38621	
 38622	âHe is my refuge! His will be done!â he exclaimed.
 38623	
 38624	A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward
 38625	the prince.
 38626	
 38627	âWell, good-by!â said Prince Andrew, bending over to AlpÃ¡tych. âYou
 38628	must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the
 38629	RyazÃ¡n estate or to the one near Moscow.â
 38630	
 38631	AlpÃ¡tych clung to Prince Andrewâs leg and burst into sobs. Gently
 38632	disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the
 38633	avenue at a gallop.
 38634	
 38635	The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly
 38636	impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on
 38637	which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out
 38638	from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from
 38639	the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master,
 38640	the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the
 38641	hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some
 38642	green plums they had dropped.
 38643	
 38644	Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them
 38645	see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened
 38646	little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible
 38647	desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him
 38648	when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other human
 38649	interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those
 38650	that occupied him. Evidently these girls passionately desired one
 38651	thingâto carry away and eat those green plums without being caughtâand
 38652	Prince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He
 38653	could not resist looking at them once more. Believing their danger past,
 38654	they sprang from their ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill
 38655	little voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned
 38656	feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.
 38657	
 38658	Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty
 38659	highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills
 38660	he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting
 38661	place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one oâclock. The sun,
 38662	a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably
 38663	through his black coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz
 38664	of talk that came from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he
 38665	crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the
 38666	pond. He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and
 38667	he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and
 38668	laughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a
 38669	foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies
 38670	of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing
 38671	about in it. All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking,
 38672	floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering
 38673	can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered
 38674	it specially pathetic.
 38675	
 38676	One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew
 38677	knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself,
 38678	stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another,
 38679	a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his
 38680	waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted
 38681	with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands
 38682	blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another,
 38683	yelling, and puffing.
 38684	
 38685	Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy,
 38686	white, muscular flesh. The officer, TimÃ³khin, with his red little nose,
 38687	standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing
 38688	the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.
 38689	
 38690	âItâs very nice, your excellency! Wouldnât you like to?â said he.
 38691	
 38692	âItâs dirty,â replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.
 38693	
 38694	âWeâll clear it out for you in a minute,â said TimÃ³khin, and, still
 38695	undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.
 38696	
 38697	âThe prince wants to bathe.â
 38698	
 38699	âWhat prince? Ours?â said many voices, and the men were in such haste
 38700	to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he
 38701	would rather wash himself with water in the barn.
 38702	
 38703	âFlesh, bodies, cannon fodder!â he thought, and he looked at his own
 38704	naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust
 38705	and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that
 38706	immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.
 38707	
 38708	
 38709	On the seventh of August Prince BagratiÃ³n wrote as follows from his
 38710	quarters at MikhÃ¡ylovna on the SmolÃ©nsk road:
 38711	
 38712	Dear Count AlÃ©xis AndrÃ©evichâ(He was writing to ArakchÃ©ev but knew that
 38713	his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every
 38714	word in it to the best of his ability.)
 38715	
 38716	I expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the
 38717	abandonment of SmolÃ©nsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and
 38718	the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been
 38719	wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently
 38720	and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear
 38721	to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and
 38722	might have lost half his army but could not have taken SmolÃ©nsk. Our
 38723	troops fought, and are fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand
 38724	men I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he
 38725	would not hold out even for fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain
 38726	on our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If
 38727	he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about
 38728	four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten
 38729	thousand, thatâs war! But the enemy has lost masses....
 38730	
 38731	What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would
 38732	have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men
 38733	or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent
 38734	instructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this
 38735	way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow....
 38736	
 38737	There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you
 38738	should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You
 38739	would set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed
 38740	to wear the uniform. If it has come to thisâwe must fight as long as
 38741	Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand....
 38742	
 38743	One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps
 38744	be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but
 38745	execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I
 38746	am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear
 38747	that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the
 38748	Minister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and
 38749	desires the ruin of us all. So I write you frankly: call out the
 38750	militia. For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow
 38751	in a most masterly way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the
 38752	Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is said to be more Napoleonâs man
 38753	than ours, and he is always advising the Minister. I am not merely civil
 38754	to him but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior. This is
 38755	painful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am
 38756	sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he.
 38757	Consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the
 38758	hospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would
 38759	not have happened. Tell me, for Godâs sake, what will Russia, our mother
 38760	Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning our
 38761	good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of
 38762	hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and of whom
 38763	are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is vacillating,
 38764	a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The whole army
 38765	bewails it and calls down curses upon him....

 38771	CHAPTER VI
 38772	
 38773	Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human
 38774	life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails
 38775	and those in which form prevails. To the latterâas distinguished
 38776	from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow lifeâwe may allot
 38777	Petersburg life, and especially the life of its salons. That life of
 38778	the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had
 38779	again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade
 38780	them again, but the salons of Anna PÃ¡vlovna and HÃ©lÃ¨ne remained just
 38781	as they had beenâthe one seven and the other five years before. At Anna
 38782	PÃ¡vlovnaâs they talked with perplexity of Bonaparteâs successes just
 38783	as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the
 38784	European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was
 38785	to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna
 38786	PÃ¡vlovna was the representative. And in HÃ©lÃ¨neâs salon, which RumyÃ¡ntsev
 38787	himself honored with his visits, regarding HÃ©lÃ¨ne as a remarkably
 38788	intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808
 38789	of the âgreat nationâ and the âgreat man,â and regretted our rupture
 38790	with France, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly
 38791	terminated by peace.
 38792	
 38793	Of late, since the Emperorâs return from the army, there had been some
 38794	excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations
 38795	of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency.
 38796	In Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were
 38797	deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the
 38798	effect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to
 38799	maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole
 38800	army corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only
 38801	the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French
 38802	circle of HÃ©lÃ¨ne and RumyÃ¡ntsev the reports of the cruelty of the
 38803	enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleonâs attempts at
 38804	conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those
 38805	who advised hurried preparations for a removal to KazÃ¡n of the court and
 38806	the girlsâ educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager
 38807	Empress. In HÃ©lÃ¨neâs circle the war in general was regarded as a series
 38808	of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the
 38809	view prevailed expressed by BilÃ­binâwho now in Petersburg was quite at
 38810	home in HÃ©lÃ¨neâs house, which every clever man was obliged to visitâthat
 38811	not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be
 38812	settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasmânews of which had reached
 38813	Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperorâs returnâwas ridiculed
 38814	sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.
 38815	
 38816	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm
 38817	and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients.
 38818	Prince VasÃ­li, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a
 38819	connecting link between these two circles. He visited his âgood friend
 38820	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ as well as his daughterâs âdiplomatic salon,â and often
 38821	in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused
 38822	and said at HÃ©lÃ¨neâs what he should have said at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs and
 38823	vice versa.
 38824	
 38825	Soon after the Emperorâs return Prince VasÃ­li in a conversation about
 38826	the war at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was
 38827	undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the
 38828	visitors, usually spoken of as âa man of great merit,â having described
 38829	how he had that day seen KutÃºzov, the newly chosen chief of the
 38830	Petersburg militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the
 38831	Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest that KutÃºzov would be the man
 38832	to satisfy all requirements.
 38833	
 38834	Anna PÃ¡vlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that KutÃºzov had done
 38835	nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.
 38836	
 38837	âI have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,â Prince
 38838	VasÃ­li interrupted, âbut they did not listen to me. I told them his
 38839	election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They did
 38840	not listen to me.
 38841	
 38842	âItâs all this mania for opposition,â he went on. âAnd who for? It is
 38843	all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,â
 38844	Prince VasÃ­li continued, forgetting for a moment that though at HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 38845	one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs one had to
 38846	be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. âNow, is
 38847	it suitable that Count KutÃºzov, the oldest general in Russia, should
 38848	preside at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains! How could
 38849	they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops
 38850	asleep at a council, and has the very worst morals! A good reputation
 38851	he made for himself at Bucharest! I donât speak of his capacity as a
 38852	general, but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit, blind old
 38853	man, positively blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He canât see
 38854	anything. To play blindmanâs bulff? He canât see at all!â
 38855	
 38856	No one replied to his remarks.
 38857	
 38858	This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the
 38859	twenty-ninth of July KutÃºzov received the title of Prince. This might
 38860	indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince VasÃ­liâs opinion
 38861	continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express
 38862	it. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal
 38863	SaltykÃ³v, ArakchÃ©ev, VyazmÃ­tinov, LopukhÃ­n, and KochubÃ©y met to consider
 38864	the progress of the war. This committee came to the conclusion that
 38865	our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the
 38866	members of the committee were aware of the Emperorâs dislike of KutÃºzov,
 38867	after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as
 38868	commander in chief. That same day KutÃºzov was appointed commander
 38869	in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region
 38870	occupied by them.
 38871	
 38872	On the ninth of August Prince VasÃ­li at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs again met the
 38873	âman of great merit.â The latter was very attentive to Anna PÃ¡vlovna
 38874	because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational
 38875	establishments for young ladies. Prince VasÃ­li entered the room with the
 38876	air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.
 38877	
 38878	âWell, have you heard the great news? Prince KutÃºzov is field marshal!
 38879	All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last
 38880	we have a man!â said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at
 38881	everyone in the drawing room.
 38882	
 38883	The âman of great merit,â despite his desire to obtain the post of
 38884	director, could not refrain from reminding Prince VasÃ­li of his former
 38885	opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince VasÃ­li in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs
 38886	drawing room, and also to Anna PÃ¡vlovna herself who had received the
 38887	news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.
 38888	
 38889	âBut, Prince, they say he is blind!â said he, reminding Prince VasÃ­li of
 38890	his own words.
 38891	
 38892	âEh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,â said Prince VasÃ­li rapidly, in a
 38893	deep voice and with a slight coughâthe voice and cough with which he was
 38894	wont to dispose of all difficulties.
 38895	
 38896	âHe sees well enough,â he added. âAnd what I am so pleased about,â he
 38897	went on, âis that our sovereign has given him full powers over all
 38898	the armies and the whole regionâpowers no commander in chief ever had
 38899	before. He is a second autocrat,â he concluded with a victorious smile.
 38900	
 38901	âGod grant it! God grant it!â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 38902	
 38903	The âman of great merit,â who was still a novice in court circles,
 38904	wishing to flatter Anna PÃ¡vlovna by defending her former position on
 38905	this question, observed:
 38906	
 38907	âIt is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give KutÃºzov those powers.
 38908	They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to
 38909	KutÃºzov: âYour Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.ââ
 38910	
 38911	âPerhaps the heart took no part in that speech,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 38912	
 38913	âOh, no, no!â warmly rejoined Prince VasÃ­li, who would not now yield
 38914	KutÃºzov to anyone; in his opinion KutÃºzov was not only admirable
 38915	himself, but was adored by everybody. âNo, thatâs impossible,â said he,
 38916	âfor our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.â
 38917	
 38918	âGod grant only that Prince KutÃºzov assumes real power and does not
 38919	allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,â observed Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 38920	
 38921	Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince VasÃ­li said in a
 38922	whisper:
 38923	
 38924	âI know for a fact that KutÃºzov made it an absolute condition that the
 38925	TsarÃ©vich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the
 38926	Emperor?â
 38927	
 38928	And Prince VasÃ­li repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by
 38929	KutÃºzov to the Emperor. âI can neither punish him if he does wrong nor
 38930	reward him if he does right.â
 38931	
 38932	âOh, a very wise man is Prince KutÃºzov! I have known him a long time!â
 38933	
 38934	âThey even say,â remarked the âman of great meritâ who did not yet
 38935	possess courtly tact, âthat his excellency made it an express condition
 38936	that the sovereign himself should not be with the army.â
 38937	
 38938	As soon as he said this both Prince VasÃ­li and Anna PÃ¡vlovna turned away
 38939	from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naÃ¯vetÃ©.
 38940	
 38941	
 38942	
 38943	
 38944	
 38945	CHAPTER VII
 38946	
 38947	While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already passed
 38948	SmolÃ©nsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napoleonâs
 38949	historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his
 38950	hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will. He
 38951	is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic
 38952	events in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians
 38953	who maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the
 38954	Russian commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards
 38955	all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur,
 38956	the law of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good
 38957	chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss
 38958	resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the
 38959	opening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar
 38960	mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect. He only notices the
 38961	mistake to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage
 38962	of it. How much more complex than this is the game of war, which
 38963	occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that
 38964	manipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable
 38965	conflicts of various wills!
 38966	
 38967	After SmolÃ©nsk Napoleon sought a battle beyond DorogobÃºzh at VyÃ¡zma, and
 38968	then at TsÃ¡revo-ZaymÃ­shche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction
 38969	of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till
 38970	they reached BorodinÃ³, seventy miles from Moscow. From VyÃ¡zma Napoleon
 38971	ordered a direct advance on Moscow.
 38972	
 38973	Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacrÃ©e des
 38974	peuples dâAlexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables Ã©glises en forme de
 38975	pagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleonâs imagination no rest.
 38976	On the march from VyÃ¡zma to TsÃ¡revo-ZaymÃ­shche he rode his light bay
 38977	bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages,
 38978	and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to
 38979	question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by
 38980	Lelorgne dâIdeville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop
 38981	and reined in his horse with an amused expression.
 38982	
 38983	     * âMoscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the
 38984	     sacred city of Alexanderâs people, Moscow with its
 38985	     innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.â
 38986	
 38987	
 38988	âWell?â asked Napoleon.
 38989	
 38990	âOne of PlÃ¡tovâs Cossacks says that PlÃ¡tovâs corps is joining up with
 38991	the main army and that KutÃºzov has been appointed commander in chief. He
 38992	is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.â
 38993	
 38994	Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the
 38995	man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped
 38996	off, and an hour later, LavrÃºshka, the serf DenÃ­sov had handed over
 38997	to RostÃ³v, rode up to Napoleon in an orderlyâs jacket and on a French
 38998	cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride
 38999	by his side and began questioning him.
 39000	
 39001	âYou are a Cossack?â
 39002	
 39003	âYes, a Cossack, your Honor.â
 39004	
 39005	âThe Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleonâs plain
 39006	appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind
 39007	the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the
 39008	incidents of the war,â says Thiers, narrating this episode. In
 39009	reality LavrÃºshka, having got drunk the day before and left his master
 39010	dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of
 39011	chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner.
 39012	LavrÃºshka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all
 39013	sorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and
 39014	cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master,
 39015	and are keen at guessing their masterâs baser impulses, especially those
 39016	prompted by vanity and pettiness.
 39017	
 39018	Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily
 39019	and surely recognized, LavrÃºshka was not in the least abashed but merely
 39020	did his utmost to gain his new masterâs favor.
 39021	
 39022	He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleonâs presence could
 39023	no more intimidate him than RostÃ³vâs, or a sergeant majorâs with the
 39024	rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major
 39025	or Napoleon could deprive him of.
 39026	
 39027	So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the
 39028	orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the
 39029	Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, LavrÃºshka screwed up
 39030	his eyes and considered.
 39031	
 39032	In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning
 39033	in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.
 39034	
 39035	âItâs like this,â he said thoughtfully, âif thereâs a battle soon, yours
 39036	will win. Thatâs right. But if three days pass, then after that, well,
 39037	then that same battle will not soon be over.â
 39038	
 39039	Lelorgne dâIdeville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus:
 39040	âIf a battle takes place within the next three days the French will
 39041	win, but if later, God knows what will happen.â Napoleon did not smile,
 39042	though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words
 39043	to be repeated.
 39044	
 39045	LavrÃºshka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to
 39046	know who Napoleon was, added:
 39047	
 39048	âWe know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the
 39049	world, but we are a different matter...ââwithout knowing why or how this
 39050	bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.
 39051	
 39052	The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and
 39053	Bonaparte smiled. âThe young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor
 39054	smile,â says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence, Napoleon
 39055	turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was
 39056	talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who had written his
 39057	immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would affect this enfant du
 39058	Don. *
 39059	
 39060	    * âChild of the Don.â
 39061	
 39062	
 39063	The fact was accordingly conveyed to LavrÃºshka.
 39064	
 39065	LavrÃºshka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that
 39066	Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters
 39067	promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes
 39068	wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be
 39069	whipped. âAs soon as Napoleonâs interpreter had spoken,â says Thiers,
 39070	âthe Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode
 39071	on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across
 39072	the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and
 39073	replaced by a naÃ¯ve and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after
 39074	making the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to
 39075	its native fields.â
 39076	
 39077	Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his
 39078	imagination, and âthe bird restored to its native fieldsâ galloped to
 39079	our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that
 39080	he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did
 39081	not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He
 39082	found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with PlÃ¡tovâs
 39083	detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas RostÃ³v, quartered
 39084	at YankÃ³vo. RostÃ³v was just mounting to go for a ride round the
 39085	neighboring villages with IlyÃ­n; he let LavrÃºshka have another horse and
 39086	took him along with him.
 39087	
 39088	
 39089	
 39090	
 39091	
 39092	CHAPTER VIII
 39093	
 39094	Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew
 39095	supposed.
 39096	
 39097	After the return of AlpÃ¡tych from SmolÃ©nsk the old prince suddenly
 39098	seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called
 39099	up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in
 39100	chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the
 39101	last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chiefâs
 39102	discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where
 39103	one of Russiaâs oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he
 39104	announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.
 39105	
 39106	But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of
 39107	the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to BoguchÃ¡rovo and
 39108	thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her fatherâs feverish and
 39109	sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to
 39110	leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey
 39111	him. She refused to go away and her fatherâs fury broke over her in a
 39112	terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on
 39113	her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused
 39114	his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making
 39115	it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from
 39116	his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same
 39117	to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and
 39118	warned her not to dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as
 39119	she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her
 39120	not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof
 39121	that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and
 39122	had not gone away.
 39123	
 39124	The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his
 39125	full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His calÃ¨che
 39126	was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in
 39127	his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his
 39128	armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to
 39129	his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came
 39130	running up the avenue with frightened faces.
 39131	
 39132	Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and
 39133	into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving
 39134	toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by
 39135	the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and
 39136	decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that
 39137	fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,
 39138	could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see
 39139	was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
 39140	of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless
 39141	lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out what he
 39142	wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very
 39143	couch he had so feared of late.
 39144	
 39145	The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the
 39146	prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.
 39147	
 39148	It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and
 39149	next day they moved the prince to BoguchÃ¡rovo, the doctor accompanying
 39150	him.
 39151	
 39152	By the time they reached BoguchÃ¡rovo, Dessalles and the little prince
 39153	had already left for Moscow.
 39154	
 39155	For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new
 39156	house Prince Andrew had built at BoguchÃ¡rovo, ever in the same state,
 39157	getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like
 39158	a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips
 39159	twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was
 39160	going on around him or not. One thing was certainâthat he was suffering
 39161	and wished to say something. But what it was, no one could tell: it
 39162	might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate
 39163	to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.
 39164	
 39165	The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due
 39166	to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell
 39167	her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his
 39168	restlessness confirmed her opinion.
 39169	
 39170	He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no
 39171	hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do
 39172	to let him die on the road. âWould it not be better if the end did come,
 39173	the very end?â Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly
 39174	sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched
 39175	him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find
 39176	symptoms of the approach of the end.
 39177	
 39178	Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet
 39179	there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since
 39180	her fatherâs illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with
 39181	him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes
 39182	that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts
 39183	that had not entered her mind for yearsâthoughts of a life free from
 39184	the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family
 39185	happinessâfloated continually in her imagination like temptations of the
 39186	devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually recurred
 39187	to her as to how she would order her life now, after that. These were
 39188	temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the
 39189	sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed
 39190	an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words of a
 39191	prayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different world had
 39192	now taken possession of herâthe life of a world of strenuous and free
 39193	activity, quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she
 39194	had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer.
 39195	She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of
 39196	her.
 39197	
 39198	It was becoming dangerous to remain in BoguchÃ¡rovo. News of the approach
 39199	of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from
 39200	BoguchÃ¡rovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.
 39201	
 39202	The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the
 39203	provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary
 39204	to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the
 39205	rural police having come to BoguchÃ¡rovo urged the same thing, saying
 39206	that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French
 39207	proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the princess
 39208	did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer
 39209	for the consequences.
 39210	
 39211	The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation
 39212	and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day.
 39213	She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in
 39214	the room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, waking up,
 39215	she heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps
 39216	of TÃ­khon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she
 39217	listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were
 39218	louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not
 39219	sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter
 39220	but not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw
 39221	and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him.
 39222	She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she
 39223	sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during
 39224	the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.
 39225	
 39226	But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing
 39227	him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his
 39228	found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories
 39229	temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of
 39230	how things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life
 39231	would be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward
 39232	morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.
 39233	
 39234	She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her
 39235	clearly what chiefly concerned her about her fatherâs illness. On waking
 39236	she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him
 39237	groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.
 39238	
 39239	âBut what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!â she
 39240	cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.
 39241	
 39242	She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In
 39243	front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed
 39244	into the vehicles.
 39245	
 39246	It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still
 39247	horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts
 39248	before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to
 39249	her.
 39250	
 39251	âHe is a little better today,â said he. âI was looking for you. One can
 39252	make out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come in,
 39253	he is asking for you....â
 39254	
 39255	Princess Maryâs heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale
 39256	and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to
 39257	him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with
 39258	those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.
 39259	
 39260	âCome,â said the doctor.
 39261	
 39262	Princess Mary entered her fatherâs room and went up to his bed. He was
 39263	lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with
 39264	their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed
 39265	straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips
 39266	motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face
 39267	seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller.
 39268	Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers
 39269	so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He
 39270	twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.
 39271	
 39272	She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When
 39273	she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he
 39274	calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips
 39275	and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and
 39276	imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.
 39277	
 39278	Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic
 39279	efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with
 39280	difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something,
 39281	repeating the same words several times. She could not understand them,
 39282	but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words
 39283	he uttered.
 39284	
 39285	âMmm...ar...ate...ate...â he repeated several times.
 39286	
 39287	It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought
 39288	he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: âMary, are you afraid?â
 39289	The prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.
 39290	
 39291	âMy mind, my mind aches?â questioned Princess Mary.
 39292	
 39293	He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and
 39294	began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find
 39295	the right place for it.
 39296	
 39297	âAlways thoughts... about you... thoughts...â he then uttered much
 39298	more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being
 39299	understood.
 39300	
 39301	Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs
 39302	and tears.
 39303	
 39304	He moved his hand over her hair.
 39305	
 39306	âI have been calling you all night...â he brought out.
 39307	
 39308	âIf only I had known...â she said through her tears. âI was afraid to
 39309	come in.â
 39310	
 39311	He pressed her hand.
 39312	
 39313	âWerenât you asleep?â
 39314	
 39315	âNo, I did not sleep,â said Princess Mary, shaking her head.
 39316	
 39317	Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as
 39318	he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move
 39319	with difficulty.
 39320	
 39321	âDear one... Dearest...â Princess Mary could not quite make out what he
 39322	had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender
 39323	caressing word such as he had never used to her before. âWhy didnât you
 39324	come in?â
 39325	
 39326	âAnd I was wishing for his death!â thought Princess Mary.
 39327	
 39328	He was silent awhile.
 39329	
 39330	âThank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank
 39331	you!... forgive!... thank you!...â and tears began to flow from his
 39332	eyes. âCall Andrew!â he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression
 39333	of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.
 39334	
 39335	He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it
 39336	seemed to Princess Mary.
 39337	
 39338	âI have a letter from him,â she replied.
 39339	
 39340	He glanced at her with timid surprise.
 39341	
 39342	âWhere is he?â
 39343	
 39344	âHeâs with the army, Father, at SmolÃ©nsk.â
 39345	
 39346	He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in
 39347	answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and
 39348	remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.
 39349	
 39350	âYes,â he said, softly and distinctly. âRussia has perished. Theyâve
 39351	destroyed her.â
 39352	
 39353	And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary
 39354	could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.
 39355	
 39356	Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and
 39357	TÃ­khon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.
 39358	
 39359	Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could
 39360	understand for a long time, till at last TÃ­khon understood and repeated
 39361	it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in
 39362	which he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia,
 39363	or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and
 39364	so she could not guess his words.
 39365	
 39366	âPut on your white dress. I like it,â was what he said.
 39367	
 39368	Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor
 39369	taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to
 39370	persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the
 39371	prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the
 39372	Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and
 39373	then he had a second and final stroke.
 39374	
 39375	Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and
 39376	sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing,
 39377	except passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had
 39378	never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as
 39379	far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had
 39380	planted.
 39381	
 39382	âYes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end
 39383	quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What
 39384	use will peace be when he is no longer here?â Princess Mary murmured,
 39385	pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom
 39386	which heaved with convulsive sobs.
 39387	
 39388	When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her
 39389	again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienneâwho had remained
 39390	at BoguchÃ¡rovo and did not wish to leave itâcoming toward her with a
 39391	stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who
 39392	had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her
 39393	prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she
 39394	led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then,
 39395	excusing herself, she went to the door of the old princeâs room. The
 39396	doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.
 39397	
 39398	âGo away, Princess! Go away... go away!â
 39399	
 39400	She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the
 39401	slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how
 39402	long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a womanâs
 39403	footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw DunyÃ¡sha her maid,
 39404	who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in
 39405	alarm on seeing her mistress.
 39406	
 39407	âPlease come, Princess... The Prince,â said DunyÃ¡sha in a breaking
 39408	voice.
 39409	
 39410	âImmediately, Iâm coming, Iâm coming!â replied the princess hurriedly,
 39411	not giving DunyÃ¡sha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to
 39412	avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.
 39413	
 39414	âPrincess, itâs Godâs will! You must be prepared for everything,â said
 39415	the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.
 39416	
 39417	âLet me alone; itâs not true!â she cried angrily to him.
 39418	
 39419	The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her
 39420	fatherâs door. âWhy are these people with frightened faces stopping me?
 39421	I donât want any of them! And what are they doing here?â she thought.
 39422	She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened
 39423	room startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women. They all
 39424	drew back from the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the
 39425	bed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess
 39426	Mary stop short on the threshold.
 39427	
 39428	âNo, heâs not deadâitâs impossible!â she told herself and approached
 39429	him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips
 39430	to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the
 39431	tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was
 39432	replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. âNo, he
 39433	is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and
 39434	hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!â And hiding
 39435	her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor,
 39436	who held her up.
 39437	
 39438	
 39439	In the presence of TÃ­khon and the doctor the women washed what had been
 39440	the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should
 39441	not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the
 39442	legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform
 39443	with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table.
 39444	Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done
 39445	as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his
 39446	coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of
 39447	juniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a
 39448	corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.
 39449	
 39450	Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the
 39451	inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round
 39452	the coffinâthe Marshal, the village Elder, peasant womenâand all with
 39453	fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old
 39454	princeâs cold and stiffened hand.
 39455	
 39456	
 39457	
 39458	
 39459	
 39460	CHAPTER IX
 39461	
 39462	Until Prince Andrew settled in BoguchÃ¡rovo its owners had always been
 39463	absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from
 39464	those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress, and
 39465	disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used to
 39466	approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills
 39467	to help with the harvest, or to dig ponds and ditches, but he disliked
 39468	them for their boorishness.
 39469	
 39470	Prince Andrewâs last stay at BoguchÃ¡rovo, when he introduced hospitals
 39471	and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not
 39472	softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in
 39473	them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness. Various
 39474	obscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that
 39475	they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to
 39476	which they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the
 39477	Tsarâs and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which
 39478	it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had
 39479	stopped it), then of Peter FÃ«dorovichâs return to the throne in seven
 39480	yearsâ time, when everything would be made free and so âsimpleâ that
 39481	there would be no restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and
 39482	his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague
 39483	notions of Antichrist, the end of the world, and âpure freedom.â
 39484	
 39485	In the vicinity of BoguchÃ¡rovo were large villages belonging to the
 39486	crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they
 39487	pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood
 39488	and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the
 39489	peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of
 39490	the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to
 39491	contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among
 39492	others. One instance, which had occurred some twenty years before, was
 39493	a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown âwarm rivers.â
 39494	Hundreds of peasants, among them the BoguchÃ¡rovo folk, suddenly began
 39495	selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast.
 39496	As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their
 39497	wives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of
 39498	them had ever been. They set off in caravans, bought their freedom one
 39499	by one or ran away, and drove or walked toward the âwarm rivers.â Many
 39500	of them were punished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and
 39501	hunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement
 39502	died down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason.
 39503	But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new
 39504	forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and
 39505	at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone
 39506	living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these
 39507	undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.
 39508	
 39509	AlpÃ¡tych, who had reached BoguchÃ¡rovo shortly before the old princeâs
 39510	death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to
 39511	what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of
 39512	forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages
 39513	to be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region
 39514	round BoguchÃ¡rovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French,
 39515	received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not
 39516	migrate. He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant
 39517	Karp, who possessed great influence in the village commune and had
 39518	recently been away driving a government transport, had returned with
 39519	news that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the
 39520	French did not harm them. AlpÃ¡tych also knew that on the previous day
 39521	another peasant had even brought from the village of VisloÃºkhovo, which
 39522	was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no
 39523	harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would
 39524	be paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had
 39525	brought from VisloÃºkhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that
 39526	they were false) paid to him in advance for hay.
 39527	
 39528	More important still, AlpÃ¡tych learned that on the morning of the
 39529	very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the
 39530	princessâ luggage from BoguchÃ¡rovo, there had been a village meeting at
 39531	which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no
 39532	time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old princeâs death,
 39533	the Marshal had insisted on Princess Maryâs leaving at once, as it was
 39534	becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he could
 39535	not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of the day the
 39536	old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return next day for
 39537	the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he received tidings that
 39538	the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had barely time to remove his
 39539	own family and valuables from his estate.
 39540	
 39541	For some thirty years BoguchÃ¡rovo had been managed by the village Elder,
 39542	Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive âDrÃ³nushka.â
 39543	
 39544	Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow
 39545	big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they
 39546	are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as
 39547	straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.
 39548	
 39549	Soon after the migration to the âwarm rivers,â in which he had taken
 39550	part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of
 39551	BoguchÃ¡rovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for
 39552	twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their
 39553	master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward
 39554	respected him and jestingly called him âthe Minister.â During the
 39555	whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill, never after
 39556	sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue,
 39557	and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money
 39558	account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless
 39559	cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the whole corn
 39560	crop on any single acre of the BoguchÃ¡rovo fields.
 39561	
 39562	AlpÃ¡tych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his
 39563	Dron on the day of the princeâs funeral and told him to have twelve
 39564	horses got ready for the princessâ carriages and eighteen carts for
 39565	the things to be removed from BoguchÃ¡rovo. Though the peasants paid
 39566	quitrent, AlpÃ¡tych thought no difficulty would be made about complying
 39567	with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty households at
 39568	work in BoguchÃ¡rovo and the peasants were well to do. But on hearing the
 39569	order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent. AlpÃ¡tych named certain
 39570	peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take the carts.
 39571	
 39572	Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.
 39573	AlpÃ¡tych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses
 39574	available: some horses were carting for the government, others were too
 39575	weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses
 39576	could be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.
 39577	
 39578	AlpÃ¡tych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model
 39579	village Elder, so AlpÃ¡tych had not managed the princeâs estates for
 39580	twenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest
 39581	degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt
 39582	with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did
 39583	not express his personal views but the general mood of the BoguchÃ¡rovo
 39584	commune, by which the Elder had already been carried away. But he also
 39585	knew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune,
 39586	must be hesitating between the two camps: the mastersâ and the serfsâ.
 39587	He noticed this hesitation in Dronâs look and therefore frowned and
 39588	moved closer up to him.
 39589	
 39590	âNow just listen, DrÃ³nushka,â said he. âDonât talk nonsense to me. His
 39591	excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people
 39592	away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the
 39593	Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you
 39594	hear?â
 39595	
 39596	âI hear,â Dron answered without lifting his eyes.
 39597	
 39598	AlpÃ¡tych was not satisfied with this reply.
 39599	
 39600	âEh, Dron, it will turn out badly!â he said, shaking his head.
 39601	
 39602	âThe power is in your hands,â Dron rejoined sadly.
 39603	
 39604	âEh, Dron, drop it!â AlpÃ¡tych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his
 39605	bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dronâs feet. âI can see
 39606	through you and three yards into the ground under you,â he continued,
 39607	gazing at the floor in front of Dron.
 39608	
 39609	Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at AlpÃ¡tych and again lowered
 39610	his eyes.
 39611	
 39612	âYou drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their
 39613	homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning
 39614	for the princessâ things. And donât go to any meeting yourself, do you
 39615	hear?â
 39616	
 39617	Dron suddenly fell on his knees.
 39618	
 39619	âYÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me,
 39620	for Christâs sake!â
 39621	
 39622	âStop that!â cried AlpÃ¡tych sternly. âI see through you and three yards
 39623	under you,â he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his
 39624	knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had
 39625	been able to retain the old princeâs favor for twenty years had long
 39626	since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of
 39627	seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.
 39628	
 39629	Dron got up and was about to say something, but AlpÃ¡tych interrupted
 39630	him.
 39631	
 39632	âWhat is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking
 39633	of, eh?â
 39634	
 39635	âWhat am I to do with the people?â said Dron. âTheyâre quite beside
 39636	themselves; I have already told them...â
 39637	
 39638	ââTold them,â I dare say!â said AlpÃ¡tych. âAre they drinking?â he asked
 39639	abruptly.
 39640	
 39641	âQuite beside themselves, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych; theyâve fetched another
 39642	barrel.â
 39643	
 39644	âWell, then, listen! Iâll go to the police officer, and you tell them
 39645	so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.â
 39646	
 39647	âI understand.â
 39648	
 39649	AlpÃ¡tych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time
 39650	and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion
 39651	that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive âI understandâ
 39652	from Dron, AlpÃ¡tych contented himself with that, though he not only
 39653	doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the
 39654	carts would not be forthcoming.
 39655	
 39656	And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the
 39657	village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which
 39658	decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the
 39659	carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the
 39660	princess, AlpÃ¡tych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which
 39661	had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for
 39662	the princessâ carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police
 39663	authorities.
 39664	
 39665	
 39666	
 39667	
 39668	
 39669	CHAPTER X
 39670	
 39671	After her fatherâs funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and
 39672	did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that AlpÃ¡tych was
 39673	asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with
 39674	Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been
 39675	lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go
 39676	away and begged to be left in peace.
 39677	
 39678	The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She
 39679	lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the
 39680	leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused
 39681	thoughts were centered on one subjectâthe irrevocability of death and
 39682	her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had
 39683	shown itself during her fatherâs illness. She wished to pray but did not
 39684	dare to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God.
 39685	She lay for a long time in that position.
 39686	
 39687	The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays
 39688	shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco
 39689	cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts
 39690	suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up,
 39691	and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the
 39692	clear but windy evening.
 39693	
 39694	âYes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will
 39695	hinder you,â she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her
 39696	head fall on the window sill.
 39697	
 39698	Someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and
 39699	kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black
 39700	dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed
 39701	her, and immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All
 39702	their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind.
 39703	But she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle
 39704	Bourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were
 39705	the reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. âBesides,
 39706	is it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?â she
 39707	thought.
 39708	
 39709	Princess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle
 39710	Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was
 39711	dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry for her
 39712	and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle
 39713	Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of
 39714	the princessâ sorrow and making herself a partner in it. She said her
 39715	only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her
 39716	sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but
 39717	this great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone,
 39718	and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess
 39719	heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and
 39720	listening to the sound of her voice.
 39721	
 39722	âYour position is doubly terrible, dear princess,â said Mademoiselle
 39723	Bourienne after a pause. âI understand that you could not, and cannot,
 39724	think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has
 39725	AlpÃ¡tych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?â she asked.
 39726	
 39727	Princess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or
 39728	where to. âIs it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not
 39729	all the same?â she thought, and did not reply.
 39730	
 39731	âYou know, chÃ¨re Marie,â said Mademoiselle Bourienne, âthat we are in
 39732	dangerâare surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move now.
 39733	If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows...â
 39734	
 39735	Princess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was
 39736	talking about.
 39737	
 39738	âOh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,â she said.
 39739	âOf course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... AlpÃ¡tych
 39740	did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing,
 39741	nothing, and donât want to....â
 39742	
 39743	âIâve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow,
 39744	but I think it would now be better to stay here,â said Mademoiselle
 39745	Bourienne. âBecause, you will agree, chÃ¨re Marie, to fall into the hands
 39746	of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.â
 39747	
 39748	Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not
 39749	printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameauâs, telling people
 39750	not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford
 39751	them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.
 39752	
 39753	âI think it would be best to appeal to that general,â she continued,
 39754	âand I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.â
 39755	
 39756	Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled
 39757	sobs.
 39758	
 39759	âFrom whom did you get this?â she asked.
 39760	
 39761	âThey probably recognized that I am French, by my name,â replied
 39762	Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.
 39763	
 39764	Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with
 39765	a pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrewâs
 39766	study.
 39767	
 39768	âDunyÃ¡sha, send AlpÃ¡tych, or DrÃ³nushka, or somebody to me!â she said,
 39769	âand tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,â she added, hearing
 39770	Mademoiselle Bourienneâs voice. âWe must go at once, at once!â she said,
 39771	appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.
 39772	
 39773	âIf Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That
 39774	I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski, asked General Rameau for
 39775	protection and accepted his favor!â This idea horrified her, made her
 39776	shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never
 39777	experienced before. All that was distressing, and especially all that
 39778	was humiliating, in her position rose vividly to her mind. âThey, the
 39779	French, would settle in this house: M. le GÃ©nÃ©ral Rameau would occupy
 39780	Prince Andrewâs study and amuse himself by looking through and reading
 39781	his letters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of
 39782	BoguchÃ¡rovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, the
 39783	soldiers would violate my fatherâs newly dug grave to steal his crosses
 39784	and stars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and
 39785	would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow...â thought Princess Mary,
 39786	not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father
 39787	and her brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what
 39788	happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead
 39789	father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts
 39790	and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what they would
 39791	have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrewâs
 39792	study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her
 39793	position.
 39794	
 39795	The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her fatherâs
 39796	death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force
 39797	and took possession of her.
 39798	
 39799	Agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael
 39800	IvÃ¡novich and now for TÃ­khon or Dron. DunyÃ¡sha, the nurse, and the other
 39801	maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienneâs statement was
 39802	correct. AlpÃ¡tych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither
 39803	could the architect Michael IvÃ¡novich, who on being sent for came in
 39804	with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile
 39805	of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to
 39806	answer the old prince without expressing views of his own, he now
 39807	replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his
 39808	answers. The old valet TÃ­khon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the
 39809	stamp of inconsolable grief, replied: âYes, Princessâ to all Princess
 39810	Maryâs questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.
 39811	
 39812	At length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow
 39813	to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.
 39814	
 39815	Princess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him.
 39816	
 39817	âDrÃ³nushka,â she said, regarding as a sure friend this DrÃ³nushka who
 39818	always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the
 39819	fair at VyÃ¡zma every year and smilingly offer it to her, âDrÃ³nushka, now
 39820	since our misfortune...â she began, but could not go on.
 39821	
 39822	âWe are all in Godâs hands,â said he, with a sigh.
 39823	
 39824	They were silent for a while.
 39825	
 39826	âDrÃ³nushka, AlpÃ¡tych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn
 39827	to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I canât even go away?â
 39828	
 39829	âWhy shouldnât you go away, your excellency? You can go,â said Dron.
 39830	
 39831	âI was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I
 39832	can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away
 39833	tonight or early tomorrow morning.â
 39834	
 39835	Dron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: âThere are no
 39836	horses; I told YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych so.â
 39837	
 39838	âWhy are there none?â asked the princess.
 39839	
 39840	âItâs all Godâs scourge,â said Dron. âWhat horses we had have been
 39841	taken for the army or have diedâthis is such a year! Itâs not a case of
 39842	feeding horsesâwe may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three
 39843	days without eating. Weâve nothing, weâve been ruined.â
 39844	
 39845	Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.
 39846	
 39847	âThe peasants are ruined? They have no bread?â she asked.
 39848	
 39849	âTheyâre dying of hunger,â said Dron. âItâs not a case of carting.â
 39850	
 39851	âBut why didnât you tell me, DrÃ³nushka? Isnât it possible to help them?
 39852	Iâll do all I can....â
 39853	
 39854	To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow
 39855	was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich
 39856	could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there
 39857	was such a thing as âlandlordâs cornâ which was sometimes given to the
 39858	peasants. She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would
 39859	refuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some
 39860	mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to
 39861	give. She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her
 39862	without scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the
 39863	peasantsâ needs and what there was in BoguchÃ¡rovo that belonged to the
 39864	landlord.
 39865	
 39866	âBut we have grain belonging to my brother?â she said.
 39867	
 39868	âThe landlordâs grain is all safe,â replied Dron proudly. âOur prince
 39869	did not order it to be sold.â
 39870	
 39871	âGive it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave
 39872	in my brotherâs name,â said she.
 39873	
 39874	Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.
 39875	
 39876	âGive them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I
 39877	give this order in my brotherâs name; and tell them that what is ours is
 39878	theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.â
 39879	
 39880	Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.
 39881	
 39882	âDischarge me, little mother, for Godâs sake! Order the keys to be taken
 39883	from me,â said he. âI have served twenty-three years and have done no
 39884	wrong. Discharge me, for Godâs sake!â
 39885	
 39886	Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was
 39887	asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his
 39888	devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the
 39889	peasants.
 39890	
 39891	
 39892	
 39893	
 39894	
 39895	CHAPTER XI
 39896	
 39897	An hour later DunyÃ¡sha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and
 39898	all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princessâ order and
 39899	wished to have word with their mistress.
 39900	
 39901	âBut I never told them to come,â said Princess Mary. âI only told Dron
 39902	to let them have the grain.â
 39903	
 39904	âOnly, for Godâs sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and donât go
 39905	out to them. Itâs all a trick,â said DunyÃ¡sha, âand when YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych
 39906	returns let us get away... and please donât...â
 39907	
 39908	âWhat is a trick?â asked Princess Mary in surprise.
 39909	
 39910	âI know it is, only listen to me for Godâs sake! Ask nurse too. They say
 39911	they donât agree to leave BoguchÃ¡rovo as you ordered.â
 39912	
 39913	âYouâre making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,â said
 39914	Princess Mary. âCall DrÃ³nushka.â
 39915	
 39916	Dron came and confirmed DunyÃ¡shaâs words; the peasants had come by the
 39917	princessâ order.
 39918	
 39919	âBut I never sent for them,â declared the princess. âYou must have given
 39920	my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.â
 39921	
 39922	Dron only sighed in reply.
 39923	
 39924	âIf you order it they will go away,â said he.
 39925	
 39926	âNo, no. Iâll go out to them,â said Princess Mary, and in spite of
 39927	the nurseâs and DunyÃ¡shaâs protests she went out into the porch; Dron,
 39928	DunyÃ¡sha, the nurse, and Michael IvÃ¡novich following her.
 39929	
 39930	âThey probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to
 39931	remain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the
 39932	French,â thought Princess Mary. âI will offer them monthly rations and
 39933	housing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in
 39934	my place,â she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd
 39935	standing on the pasture by the barn.
 39936	
 39937	The men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their
 39938	hats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, came
 39939	close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed
 39940	on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could not
 39941	distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them all
 39942	at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she
 39943	represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she boldly
 39944	began her speech.
 39945	
 39946	âI am very glad you have come,â she said without raising her eyes, and
 39947	feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. âDrÃ³nushka tells me
 39948	that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I
 39949	shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because it
 39950	is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving you
 39951	everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all our grain,
 39952	so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been told that I am
 39953	giving you the grain to keep you hereâthat is not true. On the contrary,
 39954	I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow, and
 39955	I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing.
 39956	You shall be given food and lodging.â
 39957	
 39958	The princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.
 39959	
 39960	âI am not doing this on my own account,â she continued, âI do it in the
 39961	name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother
 39962	and his son.â
 39963	
 39964	Again she paused. No one broke the silence.
 39965	
 39966	âOurs is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is
 39967	mine is yours,â she concluded, scanning the faces before her.
 39968	
 39969	All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She
 39970	could not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or
 39971	apprehension and distrustâbut the expression on all the faces was
 39972	identical.
 39973	
 39974	âWe are all very thankful for your bounty, but it wonât do for us to
 39975	take the landlordâs grain,â said a voice at the back of the crowd.
 39976	
 39977	âBut why not?â asked the princess.
 39978	
 39979	No one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that
 39980	every eye she met now was immediately dropped.
 39981	
 39982	âBut why donât you want to take it?â she asked again.
 39983	
 39984	No one answered.
 39985	
 39986	The silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch
 39987	someoneâs eye.
 39988	
 39989	âWhy donât you speak?â she inquired of a very old man who stood just
 39990	in front of her leaning on his stick. âIf you think something more is
 39991	wanted, tell me! I will do anything,â said she, catching his eye.
 39992	
 39993	But as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:
 39994	
 39995	âWhy should we agree? We donât want the grain.â
 39996	
 39997	âWhy should we give up everything? We donât agree. Donât agree.... We
 39998	are sorry for you, but weâre not willing. Go away yourself, alone...â
 39999	came from various sides of the crowd.
 40000	
 40001	And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression,
 40002	though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude,
 40003	but of angry resolve.
 40004	
 40005	âBut you canât have understood me,â said Princess Mary with a sad smile.
 40006	âWhy donât you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here
 40007	the enemy would ruin you....â
 40008	
 40009	But her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.
 40010	
 40011	âWeâre not willing. Let them ruin us! We wonât take your grain. We donât
 40012	agree.â
 40013	
 40014	Again Princess Mary tried to catch someoneâs eye, but not a single eye
 40015	in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying to avoid
 40016	her look. She felt strange and awkward.
 40017	
 40018	âOh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses
 40019	and go into bondage! I dare say! âIâll give you grain, indeed!â she
 40020	says,â voices in the crowd were heard saying.
 40021	
 40022	With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the
 40023	house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her
 40024	departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone with her
 40025	own thoughts.
 40026	
 40027	
 40028	
 40029	
 40030	
 40031	CHAPTER XII
 40032	
 40033	For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her
 40034	room hearing the sound of the peasantsâ voices that reached her from
 40035	the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt that she
 40036	could not understand them however much she might think about them. She
 40037	thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused
 40038	by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she
 40039	could remember it and weep or pray.
 40040	
 40041	After sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh. Toward
 40042	midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began
 40043	to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to
 40044	rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.
 40045	
 40046	Pictures of the near pastâher fatherâs illness and last momentsârose
 40047	one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered
 40048	over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the
 40049	picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in
 40050	imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures
 40051	presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they
 40052	seemed now present, now past, and now future.
 40053	
 40054	She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
 40055	being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,
 40056	muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray
 40057	eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.
 40058	
 40059	âEven then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,â she
 40060	thought. âHe had always thought what he said then.â And she recalled in
 40061	all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke,
 40062	when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his
 40063	will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going
 40064	to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened
 40065	at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to
 40066	TÃ­khon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress.
 40067	Evidently he had wanted to talk. âAnd why didnât he call me? Why didnât
 40068	he let me be there instead of TÃ­khon?â Princess Mary had thought and
 40069	thought again now. âNow he will never tell anyone what he had in his
 40070	soul. Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have
 40071	said all he longed to say, and not TÃ­khon but I might have heard and
 40072	understood him. Why didnât I enter the room?â she thought. âPerhaps he
 40073	would then have said to me what he said the day he died. While talking
 40074	to TÃ­khon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was
 40075	standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him
 40076	to talk to TÃ­khon who did not understand him. I remember how he began
 40077	speaking to him about Lise as if she were aliveâhe had forgotten she
 40078	was deadâand TÃ­khon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted,
 40079	âFool!â He was greatly depressed. From behind the door I heard how he
 40080	lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, âMy God!â Why didnât
 40081	I go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And
 40082	perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word
 40083	to me.â And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said
 40084	to her on the day of his death. âDear-est!â she repeated, and began
 40085	sobbing, with tears that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before
 40086	her. And not the face she had known ever since she could remember and
 40087	had always seen at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen
 40088	for the first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details,
 40089	when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.
 40090	
 40091	âDear-est!â she repeated again.
 40092	
 40093	âWhat was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking
 40094	now?â This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she
 40095	saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay
 40096	in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the
 40097	horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself
 40098	that that was not he, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her
 40099	again. She tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do
 40100	neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows,
 40101	expecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the
 40102	silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.
 40103	
 40104	âDunyÃ¡sha,â she whispered. âDunyÃ¡sha!â she screamed wildly, and tearing
 40105	herself out of this silence she ran to the servantsâ quarters to meet
 40106	her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.
 40107	
 40108	
 40109	
 40110	
 40111	
 40112	CHAPTER XIII
 40113	
 40114	On the seventeenth of August RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n, accompanied by LavrÃºshka
 40115	who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left
 40116	their quarters at YankÃ³vo, ten miles from BoguchÃ¡rovo, and went for a
 40117	rideâto try a new horse IlyÃ­n had bought and to find out whether there
 40118	was any hay to be had in the villages.
 40119	
 40120	For the last three days BoguchÃ¡rovo had lain between the two hostile
 40121	armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as
 40122	for the French vanguard; RostÃ³v, as a careful squadron commander, wished
 40123	to take such provisions as remained at BoguchÃ¡rovo before the French
 40124	could get them.
 40125	
 40126	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n were in the merriest of moods. On the way to
 40127	BoguchÃ¡rovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where
 40128	they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned
 40129	LavrÃºshka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one
 40130	another to try IlyÃ­nâs horse.
 40131	
 40132	RostÃ³v had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of
 40133	that very BolkÃ³nski who had been engaged to his sister.
 40134	
 40135	RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n gave rein to their horses for a last race along the
 40136	incline before reaching BoguchÃ¡rovo, and RostÃ³v, outstripping IlyÃ­n, was
 40137	the first to gallop into the village street.
 40138	
 40139	âYouâre first!â cried IlyÃ­n, flushed.
 40140	
 40141	âYes, always first both on the grassland and here,â answered RostÃ³v,
 40142	stroking his heated DonÃ©ts horse.
 40143	
 40144	âAnd Iâd have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,â said LavrÃºshka
 40145	from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, âonly I didnât wish to
 40146	mortify you.â
 40147	
 40148	They rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants was
 40149	standing.
 40150	
 40151	Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals
 40152	without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces
 40153	and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and
 40154	singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.
 40155	
 40156	âFine fellows!â said RostÃ³v laughing. âIs there any hay here?â
 40157	
 40158	âAnd how like one another,â said IlyÃ­n.
 40159	
 40160	âA mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!â sang one of the peasants with a
 40161	blissful smile.
 40162	
 40163	One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to RostÃ³v.
 40164	
 40165	âWho do you belong to?â he asked.
 40166	
 40167	âThe French,â replied IlyÃ­n jestingly, âand here is Napoleon
 40168	himselfââand he pointed to LavrÃºshka.
 40169	
 40170	âThen you are Russians?â the peasant asked again.
 40171	
 40172	âAnd is there a large force of you here?â said another, a short man,
 40173	coming up.
 40174	
 40175	âVery large,â answered RostÃ³v. âBut why have you collected here?â he
 40176	added. âIs it a holiday?â
 40177	
 40178	âThe old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,â replied
 40179	the peasant, moving away.
 40180	
 40181	At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a
 40182	man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.
 40183	
 40184	âThe one in pink is mine, so keep off!â said IlyÃ­n on seeing DunyÃ¡sha
 40185	running resolutely toward him.
 40186	
 40187	âSheâll be ours!â said LavrÃºshka to IlyÃ­n, winking.
 40188	
 40189	âWhat do you want, my pretty?â said IlyÃ­n with a smile.
 40190	
 40191	âThe princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.â
 40192	
 40193	âThis is Count RostÃ³v, squadron commander, and I am your humble
 40194	servant.â
 40195	
 40196	âCo-o-om-pa-ny!â roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as
 40197	he looked at IlyÃ­n talking to the girl. Following DunyÃ¡sha, AlpÃ¡tych
 40198	advanced to RostÃ³v, having bared his head while still at a distance.
 40199	
 40200	âMay I make bold to trouble your honor?â said he respectfully, but with
 40201	a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand
 40202	thrust into his bosom. âMy mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince
 40203	Nicholas BolkÃ³nski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding
 40204	herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these peopleââhe
 40205	pointed to the peasantsââasks you to come up to the house.... Wonât
 40206	you, please, ride on a little farther,â said AlpÃ¡tych with a melancholy
 40207	smile, âas it is not convenient in the presence of...?â He pointed to
 40208	the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.
 40209	
 40210	âAh!... AlpÃ¡tych... Ah, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych... Grand! Forgive us for Christâs
 40211	sake, eh?â said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.
 40212	
 40213	RostÃ³v looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.
 40214	
 40215	âOr perhaps they amuse your honor?â remarked AlpÃ¡tych with a staid air,
 40216	as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.
 40217	
 40218	âNo, thereâs not much to be amused at here,â said RostÃ³v, and rode on a
 40219	little way. âWhatâs the matter?â he asked.
 40220	
 40221	âI make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here donât
 40222	wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her
 40223	horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her
 40224	excellency cannot get away.â
 40225	
 40226	âImpossible!â exclaimed RostÃ³v.
 40227	
 40228	âI have the honor to report to you the actual truth,â said AlpÃ¡tych.
 40229	
 40230	RostÃ³v dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed AlpÃ¡tych
 40231	to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared
 40232	that the princessâ offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and
 40233	her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect
 40234	that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had
 40235	not appeared when AlpÃ¡tych sent for him; and that in the morning when
 40236	the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had
 40237	come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let
 40238	her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that
 40239	they would unharness the horses. AlpÃ¡tych had gone out to admonish them,
 40240	but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing
 40241	himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that
 40242	there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would
 40243	serve her as before and obey her in everything.
 40244	
 40245	At the moment when RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n were galloping along the road,
 40246	Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of AlpÃ¡tych, her nurse, and the
 40247	maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the
 40248	cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran
 40249	away, and the women in the house began to wail.
 40250	
 40251	âFather! Benefactor! God has sent you!â exclaimed deeply moved voices as
 40252	RostÃ³v passed through the anteroom.
 40253	
 40254	Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting
 40255	room, when RostÃ³v was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why
 40256	he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian
 40257	face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a
 40258	man of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and
 40259	began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This
 40260	meeting immediately struck RostÃ³v as a romantic event. âA helpless girl
 40261	overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants!
 40262	And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there
 40263	are in her features and expression!â thought he as he looked at her and
 40264	listened to her timid story.
 40265	
 40266	When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her
 40267	fatherâs funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if
 40268	fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at
 40269	him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in RostÃ³vâs
 40270	eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that
 40271	radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.
 40272	
 40273	âI cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here
 40274	and am able to show my readiness to serve you,â said RostÃ³v, rising. âGo
 40275	when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare
 40276	to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.â
 40277	And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward
 40278	the door.
 40279	
 40280	RostÃ³vâs deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would
 40281	consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to
 40282	take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.
 40283	
 40284	Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.
 40285	
 40286	âI am very, very grateful to you,â she said in French, âbut I hope it
 40287	was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.â She
 40288	suddenly began to cry.
 40289	
 40290	âExcuse me!â she said.
 40291	
 40292	RostÃ³v, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.
 40293	
 40294	
 40295	
 40296	
 40297	
 40298	CHAPTER XIV
 40299	
 40300	âWell, is she pretty? Ah, friendâmy pink one is delicious; her name is
 40301	DunyÃ¡sha....â
 40302	
 40303	But on glancing at RostÃ³vâs face IlyÃ­n stopped short. He saw that his
 40304	hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought.
 40305	
 40306	RostÃ³v glanced angrily at IlyÃ­n and without replying strode off with
 40307	rapid steps to the village.
 40308	
 40309	âIâll show them; Iâll give it to them, the brigands!â said he to
 40310	himself.
 40311	
 40312	AlpÃ¡tych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with
 40313	him with difficulty.
 40314	
 40315	âWhat decision have you been pleased to come to?â said he.
 40316	
 40317	RostÃ³v stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on
 40318	AlpÃ¡tych.
 40319	
 40320	âDecision? What decision? Old dotard!...â cried he. âWhat have you been
 40321	about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you canât manage them? Youâre
 40322	a traitor yourself! I know you. Iâll flay you all alive!...â And as if
 40323	afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left AlpÃ¡tych and went rapidly
 40324	forward. AlpÃ¡tych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with
 40325	RostÃ³v at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said
 40326	the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be
 40327	imprudent to âoverresistâ them without an armed force, and would it not
 40328	be better first to send for the military?
 40329	
 40330	âIâll give them armed force... Iâll âoverresistâ them!â uttered RostÃ³v
 40331	meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to
 40332	vent it.
 40333	
 40334	Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick,
 40335	resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more
 40336	AlpÃ¡tych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results.
 40337	The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw
 40338	RostÃ³vâs rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.
 40339	
 40340	After the hussars had come to the village and RostÃ³v had gone to see the
 40341	princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd.
 40342	Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and
 40343	might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of
 40344	this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked
 40345	their ex-Elder.
 40346	
 40347	âHow many years have you been fattening on the commune?â Karp shouted at
 40348	him. âItâs all one to you! Youâll dig up your pot of money and take
 40349	it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are
 40350	ruined or not?â
 40351	
 40352	âWeâve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes
 40353	or take away a single grain, and thatâs all about it!â cried another.
 40354	
 40355	âIt was your sonâs turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged
 40356	your lump of a son,â a little old man suddenly began attacking Dronââand
 40357	so they took my VÃ¡nka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to
 40358	die.â
 40359	
 40360	âTo be sure, we all have to die. Iâm not against the commune,â said
 40361	Dron.
 40362	
 40363	âThatâs itânot against it! Youâve filled your belly....â
 40364	
 40365	The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as RostÃ³v, followed by
 40366	IlyÃ­n, LavrÃºshka, and AlpÃ¡tych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting
 40367	his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front.
 40368	Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer
 40369	together.
 40370	
 40371	âWho is your Elder here? Hey?â shouted RostÃ³v, coming up to the crowd
 40372	with quick steps.
 40373	
 40374	âThe Elder? What do you want with him?...â asked Karp.
 40375	
 40376	But before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a
 40377	fierce blow jerked his head to one side.
 40378	
 40379	âCaps off, traitors!â shouted RostÃ³v in a wrathful voice. âWhereâs the
 40380	Elder?â he cried furiously.
 40381	
 40382	âThe Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron ZakhÃ¡rych, you!â meek and
 40383	flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to
 40384	come off their heads.
 40385	
 40386	âWe donât riot, weâre following the orders,â declared Karp, and at that
 40387	moment several voices began speaking together.
 40388	
 40389	âItâs as the old men have decidedâthereâs too many of you giving
 40390	orders.â
 40391	
 40392	âArguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!â cried RostÃ³v unmeaningly in a
 40393	voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. âBind him, bind him!â he
 40394	shouted, though there was no one to bind him but LavrÃºshka and AlpÃ¡tych.
 40395	
 40396	LavrÃºshka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from
 40397	behind.
 40398	
 40399	âShall I call up our men from beyond the hill?â he called out.
 40400	
 40401	AlpÃ¡tych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come
 40402	and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking
 40403	off their belts.
 40404	
 40405	âWhereâs the Elder?â demanded RostÃ³v in a loud voice.
 40406	
 40407	With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.
 40408	
 40409	âAre you the Elder? Bind him, LavrÃºshka!â shouted RostÃ³v, as if that
 40410	order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.
 40411	
 40412	And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own
 40413	belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.
 40414	
 40415	âAnd you all listen to me!â said RostÃ³v to the peasants. âBe off to your
 40416	houses at once, and donât let one of your voices be heard!â
 40417	
 40418	âWhy, weâve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness. Itâs
 40419	all nonsense.... I said then that it was not in order,â voices were
 40420	heard bickering with one another.
 40421	
 40422	âThere! What did I say?â said AlpÃ¡tych, coming into his own again. âItâs
 40423	wrong, lads!â
 40424	
 40425	âAll our stupidity, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych,â came the answers, and the crowd
 40426	began at once to disperse through the village.
 40427	
 40428	The two bound men were led off to the masterâs house. The two drunken
 40429	peasants followed them.
 40430	
 40431	âAye, when I look at you!...â said one of them to Karp.
 40432	
 40433	âHow can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of,
 40434	you fool?â added the otherââA real fool!â
 40435	
 40436	Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the
 40437	BoguchÃ¡rovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the
 40438	proprietorâs goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, liberated at
 40439	Princess Maryâs wish from the cupboard where he had been confined, was
 40440	standing in the yard directing the men.
 40441	
 40442	âDonât put it in so carelessly,â said one of the peasants, a man with a
 40443	round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. âYou know it has
 40444	cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord
 40445	where itâll get rubbed? I donât like that way of doing things. Let it
 40446	all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put it under the
 40447	bast matting and cover it with hayâthatâs the way!â
 40448	
 40449	âEh, books, books!â said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrewâs
 40450	library cupboards. âDonât catch up against it! Itâs heavy, ladsâsolid
 40451	books.â
 40452	
 40453	âYes, they worked all day and didnât play!â remarked the tall,
 40454	round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the
 40455	dictionaries that were on the top.
 40456	
 40457	
 40458	Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, RostÃ³v did not go back to
 40459	the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her
 40460	carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight
 40461	miles from BoguchÃ¡rovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At
 40462	the inn at YankÃ³vo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time
 40463	permitting himself to kiss her hand.
 40464	
 40465	âHow can you speak so!â he blushingly replied to Princess Maryâs
 40466	expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had
 40467	occurred. âAny police officer would have done as much! If we had had
 40468	only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,â
 40469	said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. âI
 40470	am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.
 40471	Good-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet
 40472	you again in happier circumstances. If you donât want to make me blush,
 40473	please donât thank me!â
 40474	
 40475	But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked
 40476	him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and
 40477	tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him
 40478	for. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been
 40479	there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the
 40480	French, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger
 40481	to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and
 40482	noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind,
 40483	honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to
 40484	cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.
 40485	
 40486	When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt
 40487	her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange
 40488	question presented itself to her: did she love him?
 40489	
 40490	On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princessâ position was not
 40491	a cheerful one, DunyÃ¡sha, who went with her in the carriage, more than
 40492	once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at
 40493	something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.
 40494	
 40495	âWell, supposing I do love him?â thought Princess Mary.
 40496	
 40497	Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in
 40498	love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted herself
 40499	with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not
 40500	be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she continued to
 40501	the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for
 40502	the first and last time in her life.
 40503	
 40504	Sometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his words,
 40505	happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those moments that
 40506	DunyÃ¡sha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window.
 40507	
 40508	âWas it not fate that brought him to BoguchÃ¡rovo, and at that very
 40509	moment?â thought Princess Mary. âAnd that caused his sister to refuse my
 40510	brother?â And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.
 40511	
 40512	The impression the princess made on RostÃ³v was a very agreeable one. To
 40513	remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his
 40514	adventure at BoguchÃ¡rovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay
 40515	and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew
 40516	angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle
 40517	Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune,
 40518	had against his will more than once entered his head. For himself
 40519	personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her
 40520	he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his
 40521	fatherâs affairs in order, and would evenâhe felt itâensure Princess
 40522	Maryâs happiness.
 40523	
 40524	But SÃ³nya? And his plighted word? That was why RostÃ³v grew angry when he
 40525	was rallied about Princess BolkÃ³nskaya.
 40526	
 40527	
 40528	
 40529	
 40530	
 40531	CHAPTER XV
 40532	
 40533	On receiving command of the armies KutÃºzov remembered Prince Andrew and
 40534	sent an order for him to report at headquarters.
 40535	
 40536	Prince Andrew arrived at TsÃ¡revo-ZaymÃ­shche on the very day and at the
 40537	very hour that KutÃºzov was reviewing the troops for the first time. He
 40538	stopped in the village at the priestâs house in front of which stood the
 40539	commander in chiefâs carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate
 40540	awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called KutÃºzov. From the
 40541	field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the
 40542	roar of many voices shouting âHurrah!â to the new commander in chief.
 40543	Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces
 40544	from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of KutÃºzovâs absence and of the
 40545	fine weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick
 40546	mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince
 40547	Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and
 40548	whether he would soon be back.
 40549	
 40550	Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highnessâ staff
 40551	but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart
 40552	orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in
 40553	chiefâs orderly speaks to officers, replied:
 40554	
 40555	âWhat? His Serene Highness? I expect heâll be here soon. What do you
 40556	want?â
 40557	
 40558	The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the
 40559	orderlyâs tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and
 40560	approached BolkÃ³nski with a slight bow. BolkÃ³nski made room for him on
 40561	the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.
 40562	
 40563	âYouâre also waiting for the commander in chief?â said he. âThey say he
 40564	weceives evewyone, thank God!... Itâs awful with those sausage eaters!
 40565	ErmÃ³lov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now pâwaps
 40566	Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what was
 40567	happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in the
 40568	campaign?â he asked.
 40569	
 40570	âI had the pleasure,â replied Prince Andrew, ânot only of taking part in
 40571	the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dearânot to mention
 40572	the estate and home of my birthâmy father, who died of grief. I belong
 40573	to the province of SmolÃ©nsk.â
 40574	
 40575	âAh? Youâre Pwince BolkÃ³nski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance! Iâm
 40576	Lieutenant Colonel DenÃ­sov, better known as âVÃ¡ska,ââ said DenÃ­sov,
 40577	pressing Prince Andrewâs hand and looking into his face with a
 40578	particularly kindly attention. âYes, I heard,â said he sympathetically,
 40579	and after a short pause added: âYes, itâs Scythian warfare. Itâs all
 40580	vewy wellâonly not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince
 40581	Andwew BolkÃ³nski?â He swayed his head. âVewy pleased, Pwince, to make
 40582	your acquaintance!â he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again
 40583	pressed Prince Andrewâs hand.
 40584	
 40585	Prince Andrew knew DenÃ­sov from what NatÃ¡sha had told him of her first
 40586	suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful
 40587	feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found
 40588	place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious
 40589	impressionsâsuch as the retreat from SmolÃ©nsk, his visit to Bald Hills,
 40590	and the recent news of his fatherâs deathâand had experienced so many
 40591	emotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his
 40592	mind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their
 40593	former strength. For DenÃ­sov, too, the memories awakened by the name of
 40594	BolkÃ³nski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and
 40595	after NatÃ¡shaâs singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen
 40596	without realizing what he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of
 40597	that time and of his love for NatÃ¡sha, and passed at once to what now
 40598	interested him passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign
 40599	he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had
 40600	proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it
 40601	to KutÃºzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line
 40602	of operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or
 40603	concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the French,
 40604	we should attack their line of communication. He began explaining his
 40605	plan to Prince Andrew.
 40606	
 40607	âThey canât hold all that line. Itâs impossible. I will undertake to
 40608	bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line,
 40609	thatâs certain! Thereâs only one wayâguewilla warfare!â
 40610	
 40611	DenÃ­sov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to
 40612	BolkÃ³nski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the
 40613	army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music
 40614	and songs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of
 40615	hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.
 40616	
 40617	âHeâs coming! Heâs coming!â shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.
 40618	
 40619	BolkÃ³nski and DenÃ­sov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers
 40620	(a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw KutÃºzov coming down the
 40621	street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals
 40622	rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of
 40623	officers ran after and around them shouting, âHurrah!â
 40624	
 40625	His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. KutÃºzov was impatiently
 40626	urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he
 40627	raised his hand to his white Horse Guardâs cap with a red band and no
 40628	peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of
 40629	honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were
 40630	giving him the salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for
 40631	nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to
 40632	the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face
 40633	assumed a subtle expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of
 40634	perplexity.
 40635	
 40636	âAnd with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,
 40637	General,â he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and
 40638	DenÃ­sov.
 40639	
 40640	âHurrah! hurrah! hurrah!â shouted those behind him.
 40641	
 40642	Since Prince Andrew had last seen him KutÃºzov had grown still more
 40643	corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the
 40644	familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing
 40645	the white Horse Guardâs cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging
 40646	over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on
 40647	his brisk little horse.
 40648	
 40649	âWhew... whew... whew!â he whistled just audibly as he rode into the
 40650	yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who
 40651	means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup
 40652	and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the
 40653	effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee,
 40654	groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants
 40655	who stood ready to assist him.
 40656	
 40657	He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced
 40658	at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his
 40659	waddling gait to the porch. âWhew... whew... whew!â he whistled, and
 40660	again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was
 40661	only after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrewâs
 40662	face linked itself up with KutÃºzovâs remembrance of his personality.
 40663	
 40664	âAh, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come
 40665	along...â said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the porch
 40666	which creaked under his weight.
 40667	
 40668	He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.
 40669	
 40670	âAnd howâs your father?â
 40671	
 40672	âI received news of his death, yesterday,â replied Prince Andrew
 40673	abruptly.
 40674	
 40675	KutÃºzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off
 40676	his cap and crossed himself:
 40677	
 40678	âMay the kingdom of Heaven be his! Godâs will be done to us all!â He
 40679	sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. âI
 40680	loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.â
 40681	
 40682	He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some
 40683	time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that
 40684	KutÃºzovâs flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He
 40685	sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.
 40686	
 40687	âCome! Come with me, weâll have a talk,â said he.
 40688	
 40689	But at that moment DenÃ­sov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by
 40690	the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite
 40691	the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. KutÃºzov, his
 40692	hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. DenÃ­sov, having
 40693	given his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene
 40694	Highness a matter of great importance for their countryâs welfare.
 40695	KutÃºzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of
 40696	annoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: âFor our
 40697	countryâs welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!â DenÃ­sov blushed like a
 40698	girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous,
 40699	time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the
 40700	enemyâs lines of communication between SmolÃ©nsk and VyÃ¡zma. DenÃ­sov came
 40701	from those parts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly
 40702	a good one, especially from the strength of conviction with which he
 40703	spoke. KutÃºzov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the
 40704	door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge
 40705	from it. And from that hut, while DenÃ­sov was speaking, a general with a
 40706	portfolio under his arm really did appear.
 40707	
 40708	âWhat?â said KutÃºzov, in the midst of DenÃ­sovâs explanations, âare you
 40709	ready so soon?â
 40710	
 40711	âReady, your Serene Highness,â replied the general.
 40712	
 40713	KutÃºzov swayed his head, as much as to say: âHow is one man to deal with
 40714	it all?â and again listened to DenÃ­sov.
 40715	
 40716	âI give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,â said DenÃ­sov, âthat I
 40717	can bweak Napoleonâs line of communication!â
 40718	
 40719	âWhat relation are you to Intendant General KirÃ­l AndrÃ©evich DenÃ­sov?â
 40720	asked KutÃºzov, interrupting him.
 40721	
 40722	âHe is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.â
 40723	
 40724	âAh, we were friends,â said KutÃºzov cheerfully. âAll right, all right,
 40725	friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow weâll have a talk.â
 40726	
 40727	With a nod to DenÃ­sov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers
 40728	KonovnÃ­tsyn had brought him.
 40729	
 40730	âWould not your Serene Highness like to come inside?â said the general
 40731	on duty in a discontented voice, âthe plans must be examined and several
 40732	papers have to be signed.â
 40733	
 40734	An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness
 40735	within. But KutÃºzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he
 40736	was disengaged. He made a grimace....
 40737	
 40738	âNo, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. Iâll look
 40739	at them here,â said he. âDonât go away,â he added, turning to Prince
 40740	Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the generalâs report.
 40741	
 40742	While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a womanâs
 40743	voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on
 40744	glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome
 40745	woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding
 40746	a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.
 40747	KutÃºzovâs adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of
 40748	the priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene
 40749	Highness bread and salt. âHer husband has welcomed his Serene Highness
 40750	with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the
 40751	house.... Sheâs very pretty,â added the adjutant with a smile. At
 40752	those words KutÃºzov looked round. He was listening to the generalâs
 40753	reportâwhich consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at
 40754	TsÃ¡revo-ZaymÃ­shcheâas he had listened to DenÃ­sov, and seven years
 40755	previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of
 40756	war. He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there
 40757	was a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it
 40758	was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even
 40759	interest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard
 40760	it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of
 40761	a service of prayer. All that DenÃ­sov had said was clever and to the
 40762	point. What the general was saying was even more clever and to
 40763	the point, but it was evident that KutÃºzov despised knowledge
 40764	and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the
 40765	matterâsomething independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince
 40766	Andrew watched the commander in chiefâs face attentively, and the only
 40767	expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the
 40768	meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to
 40769	observe propriety. It was evident that KutÃºzov despised cleverness and
 40770	learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by DenÃ­sov, but despised
 40771	them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledgeâhe did not
 40772	try to display any of theseâbut because of something else. He despised
 40773	them because of his old age and experience of life. The only instruction
 40774	KutÃºzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by
 40775	the Russian troops. At the end of the report the general put before
 40776	him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army
 40777	commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners
 40778	lodged petitions for compensation.
 40779	
 40780	After hearing the matter, KutÃºzov smacked his lips together and shook
 40781	his head.
 40782	
 40783	âInto the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my
 40784	dear fellow,â said he, âinto the fire with all such things! Let them cut
 40785	the crops and burn wood to their heartsâ content. I donât order it
 40786	or allow it, but I donât exact compensation either. One canât get on
 40787	without it. âWhen wood is chopped the chips will fly.ââ He looked at the
 40788	paper again. âOh, this German precision!â he muttered, shaking his head.
 40789	
 40790	
 40791	
 40792	
 40793	
 40794	CHAPTER XVI
 40795	
 40796	âWell, thatâs all!â said KutÃºzov as he signed the last of the documents,
 40797	and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he
 40798	moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.
 40799	
 40800	The priestâs wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after
 40801	all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long
 40802	been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to KutÃºzov.
 40803	
 40804	He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:
 40805	
 40806	âAh, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!â
 40807	
 40808	He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the
 40809	dish for her. âWell, my dear, and how are we getting on?â he asked,
 40810	moving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priestâs wife
 40811	smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room.
 40812	The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with
 40813	him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to KutÃºzov.
 40814	He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned
 40815	overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince
 40816	Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the
 40817	cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.
 40818	
 40819	âWell, sit down, sit down here. Letâs have a talk,â said KutÃºzov. âItâs
 40820	sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you,
 40821	a second father....â
 40822	
 40823	Prince Andrew told KutÃºzov all he knew of his fatherâs death, and what
 40824	he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.
 40825	
 40826	âWhat... what they have brought us to!â KutÃºzov suddenly cried in an
 40827	agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince
 40828	Andrewâs story the condition Russia was in. âBut give me time, give me
 40829	time!â he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this
 40830	agitating conversation, and added: âI sent for you to keep you with me.â
 40831	
 40832	âI thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the
 40833	staff,â replied Prince Andrew with a smile which KutÃºzov noticed.
 40834	
 40835	KutÃºzov glanced inquiringly at him.
 40836	
 40837	âBut above all,â added Prince Andrew, âI have grown used to my regiment,
 40838	am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be
 40839	sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you,
 40840	believe me...â
 40841	
 40842	A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up KutÃºzovâs podgy
 40843	face. He cut BolkÃ³nski short.
 40844	
 40845	âI am sorry, for I need you. But youâre right, youâre right! Itâs not
 40846	here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are
 40847	not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers
 40848	served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember,
 40849	yes, I remember you with the standard!â said KutÃºzov, and a flush of
 40850	pleasure suffused Prince Andrewâs face at this recollection.
 40851	
 40852	Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, KutÃºzov offered his cheek to
 40853	be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old manâs eyes.
 40854	Though Prince Andrew knew that KutÃºzovâs tears came easily, and that he
 40855	was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to
 40856	show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both
 40857	pleasant and flattering to him.
 40858	
 40859	âGo your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of
 40860	honor!â He paused. âI missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to
 40861	send.â And changing the subject, KutÃºzov began to speak of the Turkish
 40862	war and the peace that had been concluded. âYes, I have been much
 40863	blamed,â he said, âboth for that war and the peace... but everything
 40864	came at the right time. Tout vient Ã  point Ã  celui qui sait attendre. *
 40865	And there were as many advisers there as here...â he went on, returning
 40866	to the subject of âadvisersâ which evidently occupied him. âAh, those
 40867	advisers!â said he. âIf we had listened to them all we should not have
 40868	made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war.
 40869	Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. KÃ¡menski would have
 40870	been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand
 40871	men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to
 40872	win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and
 40873	time are wanted. KÃ¡menski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed
 40874	these two things and took more fortresses than KÃ¡menski and made them
 40875	Turks eat horseflesh!â He swayed his head. âAnd the French shall too,
 40876	believe me,â he went on, growing warmer and beating his chest, âIâll
 40877	make them eat horseflesh!â And tears again dimmed his eyes.
 40878	
 40879	    * âEverything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.â
 40880	
 40881	
 40882	âBut shanât we have to accept battle?â remarked Prince Andrew.
 40883	
 40884	âWe shall if everybody wants it; it canât be helped.... But believe
 40885	me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two: patience and
 40886	time, they will do it all. But the advisers nâentendent pas de cette
 40887	oreille, voilÃ  le mal. * Some want a thingâothers donât. Whatâs one to
 40888	do?â he asked, evidently expecting an answer. âWell, what do you want
 40889	us to do?â he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look.
 40890	âIâll tell you what to do,â he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not
 40891	reply: âI will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, mon
 40892	cher,â he paused, âabstiens-toiâ *(2)âhe articulated the French proverb
 40893	deliberately.
 40894	
 40895	     * âDonât see it that way, thatâs the trouble.â
 40896	
 40897	     * (2) âWhen in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.â
 40898	
 40899	
 40900	âWell, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share
 40901	your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince,
 40902	nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come
 40903	straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.â
 40904	
 40905	Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter
 40906	had left the room KutÃºzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his
 40907	unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.
 40908	
 40909	Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that
 40910	interview with KutÃºzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to
 40911	the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been
 40912	entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in
 40913	that old manâin whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions,
 40914	and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions)
 40915	only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of eventsâthe more
 40916	reassured he was that everything would be as it should. âHe will not
 40917	bring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake
 40918	anything,â thought Prince Andrew, âbut he will hear everything, remember
 40919	everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder
 40920	anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is
 40921	something stronger and more important than his own willâthe inevitable
 40922	course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance,
 40923	and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his
 40924	personal wish directed to something else. And above all,â thought Prince
 40925	Andrew, âone believes in him because heâs Russian, despite the novel
 40926	by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he
 40927	said: âWhat they have brought us to!â and had a sob in it when he said
 40928	he would âmake them eat horseflesh!ââ
 40929	
 40930	On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and
 40931	general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the
 40932	popular choice of KutÃºzov as commander in chief was received.
 40933	
 40934	
 40935	
 40936	
 40937	
 40938	CHAPTER XVII
 40939	
 40940	After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual
 40941	course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to
 40942	remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe
 40943	that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English
 40944	Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything
 40945	for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had
 40946	displayed during the Emperorâs stay was the call for contributions of
 40947	men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made
 40948	assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable.

 40950	With the enemyâs approach to Moscow, the Moscovitesâ view of their
 40951	situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even
 40952	more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger
 40953	approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that
 40954	speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a
 40955	man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it;
 40956	the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and
 40957	painful to think of the danger, since it is not in manâs power to
 40958	foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is
 40959	therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to
 40960	think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to
 40961	the first voice, but in society to the second. So it was now with the
 40962	inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as gay in
 40963	Moscow as that year.
 40964	
 40965	RostopchÃ­nâs broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman,
 40966	and a Moscow burgher called KarpÃºshka ChigÃ­rin, âwhoâhaving been a
 40967	militiaman and having had rather too much at the pubâheard that Napoleon
 40968	wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the French in very bad
 40969	language, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the
 40970	eagle, began to address the assembled people,â were read and discussed,
 40971	together with the latest of VasÃ­li LvÃ³vich PÃºshkinâs bouts rimÃ©s.
 40972	
 40973	In the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these
 40974	broadsheets, and some liked the way KarpÃºshka jeered at the French,
 40975	saying: âThey will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our
 40976	buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all
 40977	dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.â
 40978	Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was
 40979	said that RostopchÃ­n had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners
 40980	from Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon
 40981	among them; but this was told chiefly to introduce RostopchÃ­nâs witty
 40982	remark on that occasion. The foreigners were deported to NÃ­zhni by
 40983	boat, and RostopchÃ­n had said to them in French: âRentrez en vous-mÃªmes;
 40984	entrez dans la barque, et nâen faites pas une barque de Charon.â * There
 40985	was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from
 40986	Moscow, and to this ShinshÃ­nâs witticism was addedâthat for that alone
 40987	Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that MamÃ³novâs
 40988	regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that BezÃºkhov
 40989	had spent even more on his, but that the best thing about BezÃºkhovâs
 40990	action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the
 40991	head of his regiment without charging anything for the show.
 40992	
 40993	     * âThink it over; get into the barque, and take care not to
 40994	     make it a barque of Charon.â
 40995	
 40996	
 40997	âYou donât spare anyone,â said Julie DrubetskÃ¡ya as she collected
 40998	and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed
 40999	fingers.
 41000	
 41001	Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell
 41002	soiree.
 41003	
 41004	âBezÃºkhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What
 41005	pleasure is there to be so caustique?â
 41006	
 41007	âA forfeit!â cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called âmon
 41008	chevalier,â and who was going with her to NÃ­zhni.
 41009	
 41010	In Julieâs set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed
 41011	that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a
 41012	slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary
 41013	Contributions.
 41014	
 41015	âAnother forfeit for a Gallicism,â said a Russian writer who was
 41016	present. ââWhat pleasure is there to beâ is not Russian!â
 41017	
 41018	âYou spare no one,â continued Julie to the young man without heeding the
 41019	authorâs remark.
 41020	
 41021	âFor caustiqueâI am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay again
 41022	for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I wonât be
 41023	responsible,â she remarked, turning to the author: âI have neither the
 41024	money nor the time, like Prince GalÃ­tsyn, to engage a master to teach me
 41025	Russian!â
 41026	
 41027	âAh, here he is!â she added. âQuand on... No, no,â she said to the
 41028	militia officer, âyou wonât catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its
 41029	rays!â and she smiled amiably at Pierre. âWe were just talking of you,â
 41030	she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman. âWe were
 41031	saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than MamÃ³novâs.â
 41032	
 41033	âOh, donât talk to me of my regiment,â replied Pierre, kissing his
 41034	hostessâ hand and taking a seat beside her. âI am so sick of it.â
 41035	
 41036	âYou will, of course, command it yourself?â said Julie, directing a sly,
 41037	sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.
 41038	
 41039	The latter in Pierreâs presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face
 41040	expressed perplexity as to what Julieâs smile might mean. In spite of
 41041	his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierreâs personality immediately
 41042	checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.
 41043	
 41044	âNo,â said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. âI
 41045	should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I
 41046	should hardly be able to climb onto a horse.â
 41047	
 41048	Among those whom Julieâs guests happened to choose to gossip about were
 41049	the RostÃ³vs.
 41050	
 41051	âI hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,â said Julie. âAnd he
 41052	is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The RazumÃ³vskis wanted
 41053	to buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He
 41054	asks too much.â
 41055	
 41056	âNo, I think the sale will come off in a few days,â said someone.
 41057	âThough it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.â
 41058	
 41059	âWhy?â asked Julie. âYou donât think Moscow is in danger?â
 41060	
 41061	âThen why are you leaving?â
 41062	
 41063	âI? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is
 41064	going: and besidesâI am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.â
 41065	
 41066	âWell, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.â
 41067	
 41068	âIf he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his
 41069	debts,â said the militia officer, speaking of RostÃ³v.
 41070	
 41071	âA kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so long in
 41072	Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite
 41073	well again now, isnât she?â Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.
 41074	
 41075	âThey are waiting for their younger son,â Pierre replied. âHe joined
 41076	ObolÃ©nskiâs Cossacks and went to BÃ©laya TsÃ©rkov where the regiment is
 41077	being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and
 41078	are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the
 41079	countess wonât on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.â
 41080	
 41081	âI met them the day before yesterday at the ArkhÃ¡rovsâ. Natalie has
 41082	recovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily some
 41083	people get over everything!â
 41084	
 41085	âGet over what?â inquired Pierre, looking displeased.
 41086	
 41087	Julie smiled.
 41088	
 41089	âYou know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de
 41090	Souzaâs novels.â
 41091	
 41092	âWhat knights? What do you mean?â demanded Pierre, blushing.
 41093	
 41094	âOh, come, my dear count! Câest la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous admire,
 41095	ma parole dâhonneur!â *
 41096	
 41097	    * âIt is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!â
 41098	
 41099	
 41100	âForfeit, forfeit!â cried the militia officer.
 41101	
 41102	âAll right, one canât talkâhow tiresome!â
 41103	
 41104	âWhat is âthe talk of all Moscowâ?â Pierre asked angrily, rising to his
 41105	feet.
 41106	
 41107	âCome now, Count, you know!â
 41108	
 41109	âI donât know anything about it,â said Pierre.
 41110	
 41111	âI know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more
 41112	friendly with VÃ©raâthat dear VÃ©ra.â
 41113	
 41114	âNo, madame!â Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, âI have not
 41115	taken on myself the role of Natalie RostÃ³vaâs knight at all, and have
 41116	not been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the
 41117	cruelty...â
 41118	
 41119	âQui sâexcuse sâaccuse,â * said Julie, smiling and waving the lint
 41120	triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the
 41121	subject. âDo you know what I heard today? Poor Mary BolkÃ³nskaya arrived
 41122	in Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?â
 41123	
 41124	    * âWho excuses himself, accuses himself.â
 41125	
 41126	
 41127	âReally? Where is she? I should like very much to see her,â said Pierre.
 41128	
 41129	âI spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their estate
 41130	near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.â
 41131	
 41132	âWell, and how is she?â asked Pierre.
 41133	
 41134	âShe is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a
 41135	romance. Nicholas RostÃ³v! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill
 41136	her and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her....â
 41137	
 41138	âAnother romance,â said the militia officer. âReally, this general
 41139	flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche
 41140	is one and Princess BolkÃ³nskaya another.â
 41141	
 41142	âDo you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune
 41143	homme.â *
 41144	
 41145	    * âA little bit in love with the young man.â
 41146	
 41147	
 41148	âForfeit, forfeit, forfeit!â
 41149	
 41150	âBut how could one say that in Russian?â
 41151	
 41152	
 41153	
 41154	
 41155	
 41156	CHAPTER XVIII
 41157	
 41158	When Pierre returned home he was handed two of RostopchÃ­nâs broadsheets
 41159	that had been brought that day.
 41160	
 41161	The first declared that the report that Count RostopchÃ­n had forbidden
 41162	people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that
 41163	ladies and tradesmenâs wives were leaving the city. âThere will be less
 41164	panic and less gossip,â ran the broadsheet âbut I will stake my life on
 41165	it that that scoundrel will not enter Moscow.â These words showed Pierre
 41166	clearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The
 41167	second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at VyÃ¡zma, that
 41168	Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the
 41169	inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for them
 41170	at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could be had at a low
 41171	price. The tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former
 41172	ChigÃ­rin talks. Pierre pondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the
 41173	terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul
 41174	but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near.
 41175	
 41176	âShall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?â he asked himself
 41177	for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table
 41178	and began to lay them out for a game of patience.
 41179	
 41180	âIf this patience comes out,â he said to himself after shuffling the
 41181	cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, âif it comes out,
 41182	it means... what does it mean?â
 41183	
 41184	He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the
 41185	eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.
 41186	
 41187	âThen it will mean that I must go to the army,â said Pierre to himself.
 41188	âCome in, come in!â he added to the princess.
 41189	
 41190	Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist,
 41191	was still living in Pierreâs house. The two younger ones had both
 41192	married.
 41193	
 41194	âExcuse my coming to you, cousin,â she said in a reproachful and
 41195	agitated voice. âYou know some decision must be come to. What is going
 41196	to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is
 41197	it that we are staying on?â
 41198	
 41199	âOn the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,â said Pierre
 41200	in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling
 41201	uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.
 41202	
 41203	âSatisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara IvÃ¡novna told me today
 41204	how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them
 41205	credit! And the people too are quite mutinousâthey no longer obey,
 41206	even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin
 41207	beating us. One canât walk in the streets. But, above all, the French
 41208	will be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one
 41209	thing of you, cousin,â she went on, âarrange for me to be taken to
 41210	Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I canât live under Bonaparteâs rule.â
 41211	
 41212	âOh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the
 41213	contrary...â
 41214	
 41215	âI wonât submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you
 41216	donât want to do this...â
 41217	
 41218	âBut I will, Iâll give the order at once.â
 41219	
 41220	The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with.
 41221	Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.
 41222	
 41223	âBut you have been misinformed,â said Pierre. âEverything is quiet in
 41224	the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! Iâve just been
 41225	reading...â He showed her the broadsheet. âCount RostopchÃ­n writes that
 41226	he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.â
 41227	
 41228	âOh, that count of yours!â said the princess malevolently. âHe is a
 41229	hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didnât
 41230	he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, âwhoever it might be,
 41231	should be dragged to the lockup by his hairâ? (How silly!) âAnd honor
 41232	and glory to whoever captures him,â he says. This is what his cajolery
 41233	has brought us to! Barbara IvÃ¡novna told me the mob near killed her
 41234	because she said something in French.â
 41235	
 41236	âOh, but itâs so... You take everything so to heart,â said Pierre, and
 41237	began laying out his cards for patience.
 41238	
 41239	Although that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army,
 41240	but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,
 41241	irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting
 41242	something terrible.
 41243	
 41244	Next day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierreâs head steward
 41245	came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his
 41246	regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates. In
 41247	general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising
 41248	a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to
 41249	repress a smile.
 41250	
 41251	âWell then, sell it,â said he. âWhatâs to be done? I canât draw back
 41252	now!â
 41253	
 41254	The worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better
 41255	was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he
 41256	expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie
 41257	had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the
 41258	RostÃ³vs remained, but he did not go to see them.
 41259	
 41260	To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of VorontsÃ³vo
 41261	to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe,
 41262	and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet
 41263	ready, but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperorâs
 41264	desire. The Emperor had written to Count RostopchÃ­n as follows:
 41265	
 41266	As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and
 41267	intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General KutÃºzov to let
 41268	him know. I have informed him of the matter.
 41269	
 41270	Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for
 41271	the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemyâs
 41272	hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of
 41273	the commander in chief.
 41274	
 41275	
 41276	On his way home from VorontsÃ³vo, as he was passing the BolÃ³tnoe Place
 41277	Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the LÃ³bnoe Place, stopped and got out
 41278	of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The
 41279	flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the
 41280	flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and
 41281	a green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and
 41282	pale, stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With
 41283	a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchmanâs
 41284	face, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.
 41285	
 41286	âWhat is it? Who is it? What is it for?â he kept asking.
 41287	
 41288	But the attention of the crowdâofficials, burghers, shopkeepers,
 41289	peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelissesâwas so eagerly centered on
 41290	what was passing in LÃ³bnoe Place that no one answered him. The stout man
 41291	rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to appear
 41292	firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but suddenly
 41293	his lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded grown-up
 41294	men cry, though angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd people
 41295	began talking loudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to
 41296	Pierre.
 41297	
 41298	âHeâs cook to some prince.â
 41299	
 41300	âEh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his
 41301	teeth on edge!â said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre,
 41302	when the Frenchman began to cry.
 41303	
 41304	The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be
 41305	appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in
 41306	dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.
 41307	
 41308	Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back
 41309	to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his
 41310	seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so
 41311	audibly that the coachman asked him:
 41312	
 41313	âWhat is your pleasure?â
 41314	
 41315	âWhere are you going?â shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to
 41316	LubyÃ¡nka Street.
 41317	
 41318	âTo the Governorâs, as you ordered,â answered the coachman.
 41319	
 41320	âFool! Idiot!â shouted Pierre, abusing his coachmanâa thing he rarely
 41321	did. âHome, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!â âI must get away
 41322	this very day,â he murmured to himself.
 41323	
 41324	At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the
 41325	LÃ³bnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no
 41326	longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that
 41327	it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the
 41328	man ought to have known it for himself.
 41329	
 41330	On reaching home Pierre gave orders to EvstÃ¡feyâhis head coachman who
 41331	knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscowâthat
 41332	he would leave that night for the army at MozhÃ¡ysk, and that his saddle
 41333	horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged that day,
 41334	so on EvstÃ¡feyâs representation Pierre had to put off his departure till
 41335	next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.
 41336	
 41337	On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and
 41338	after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night
 41339	in PerkhÃºshkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that
 41340	evening. (This was the battle of ShevÃ¡rdino.) He was told that there in
 41341	PerkhÃºshkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer
 41342	his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching
 41343	MozhÃ¡ysk.
 41344	
 41345	Every house in MozhÃ¡ysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel
 41346	where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be
 41347	had. It was full of officers.
 41348	
 41349	Everywhere in MozhÃ¡ysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the
 41350	march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon
 41351	were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the
 41352	farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea
 41353	of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and
 41354	joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a feeling akin
 41355	to what he had felt at the SlobÃ³da Palace during the Emperorâs visitâa
 41356	sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing
 41357	something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that
 41358	constitutes menâs happinessâthe comforts of life, wealth, even
 41359	life itselfâis rubbish it is pleasant to throw away, compared with
 41360	something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did not try to
 41361	determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in
 41362	sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the question of what to
 41363	sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and
 41364	joyous sensation.
 41365	
 41366	
 41367	
 41368	
 41369	
 41370	CHAPTER XIX
 41371	
 41372	On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was
 41373	fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on
 41374	the twenty-sixth the battle of BorodinÃ³ itself took place.
 41375	
 41376	Why and how were the battles of ShevÃ¡rdino and BorodinÃ³ given and
 41377	accepted? Why was the battle of BorodinÃ³ fought? There was not the least
 41378	sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result
 41379	for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer
 41380	to the destruction of Moscowâwhich we feared more than anything in
 41381	the world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were
 41382	brought nearer to the destruction of their whole armyâwhich they feared
 41383	more than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite
 41384	obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and KutÃºzov accepted that battle.
 41385	
 41386	If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must
 41387	have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles
 41388	and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army,
 41389	he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally
 41390	clear to KutÃºzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a
 41391	quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For KutÃºzov this was
 41392	mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one
 41393	man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore
 41394	should not exchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have
 41395	fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged
 41396	thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am.
 41397	
 41398	Before the battle of BorodinÃ³ our strength in proportion to the French
 41399	was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than
 41400	one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and
 41401	twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a
 41402	hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced KutÃºzov accepted the
 41403	battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius,
 41404	gave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of
 41405	communication still more. If it is said that he expected to end the
 41406	campaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by
 41407	occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleonâs
 41408	historians themselves tell us that from SmolÃ©nsk onwards he wished
 41409	to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the
 41410	occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had
 41411	seen at SmolÃ©nsk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and
 41412	had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his
 41413	wish to negotiate.
 41414	
 41415	In giving and accepting battle at BorodinÃ³, KutÃºzov acted involuntarily
 41416	and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians
 41417	provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the
 41418	generals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved
 41419	and involuntary.
 41420	
 41421	The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish
 41422	the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom
 41423	ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are
 41424	meaningless.
 41425	
 41426	On the other question, how the battle of BorodinÃ³ and the preceding
 41427	battle of ShevÃ¡rdino were fought, there also exists a definite and
 41428	well-known, but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the
 41429	affair as follows:
 41430	
 41431	The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from SmolÃ©nsk sought out
 41432	for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a
 41433	position at BorodinÃ³.
 41434	
 41435	The Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left
 41436	of the highroad (from Moscow to SmolÃ©nsk) and almost at a right angle
 41437	to it, from BorodinÃ³ to UtÃ­tsa, at the very place where the battle was
 41438	fought.
 41439	
 41440	In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on
 41441	the ShevÃ¡rdino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, we
 41442	are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the
 41443	twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on
 41444	the field of BorodinÃ³.
 41445	
 41446	So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to
 41447	look into the matter can easily convince himself.
 41448	
 41449	The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,
 41450	during the retreat passed many positions better than BorodinÃ³. They did
 41451	not stop at any one of these positions because KutÃºzov did not wish to
 41452	occupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand
 41453	for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because
 41454	MilorÃ¡dovich had not yet arrived with the militia, and for many other
 41455	reasons. The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger,
 41456	and that the position at BorodinÃ³ (the one where the battle was fought),
 41457	far from being strong, was no more a position than any other spot one
 41458	might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at
 41459	hazard.
 41460	
 41461	Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of
 41462	BorodinÃ³ to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that
 41463	is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the
 41464	twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be
 41465	fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no
 41466	entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the
 41467	twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the
 41468	position of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless
 41469	in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it
 41470	more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts
 41471	exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at
 41472	night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to
 41473	observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the
 41474	battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt
 41475	was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to
 41476	the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and BagratiÃ³n were convinced that the
 41477	ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that KutÃºzov
 41478	himself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of
 41479	the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much
 41480	later, when reports on the battle of BorodinÃ³ were written at leisure,
 41481	that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to
 41482	justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented
 41483	as infallible) that the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was an advanced postâwhereas
 41484	in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flankâand that
 41485	the battle of BorodinÃ³ was fought by us on an entrenched position
 41486	previously selected, whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot
 41487	which was almost unentrenched.
 41488	
 41489	The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river
 41490	KolochÃ¡âwhich crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute
 41491	angleâso that the left flank was at ShevÃ¡rdino, the right flank near the
 41492	village of NÃ³voe, and the center at BorodinÃ³ at the confluence of the
 41493	rivers KolochÃ¡ and VÃ³yna.
 41494	
 41495	To anyone who looks at the field of BorodinÃ³ without thinking of how
 41496	the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river
 41497	KolochÃ¡, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to
 41498	prevent an enemy from advancing along the SmolÃ©nsk road to Moscow.
 41499	
 41500	Napoleon, riding to ValÃºevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the
 41501	history books say he did) the position of the Russians from UtÃ­tsa
 41502	to BorodinÃ³ (he could not have seen that position because it did not
 41503	exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while
 41504	pursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the
 41505	Russian positionâat the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubtâand unexpectedly for the
 41506	Russians moved his army across the KolochÃ¡. And the Russians, not having
 41507	time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the
 41508	position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which
 41509	had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other
 41510	side of the KolochÃ¡ to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the
 41511	whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian
 41512	side) and transferred it to the plain between UtÃ­tsa, SemÃ«novsk, and
 41513	BorodinÃ³âa plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain
 41514	in Russiaâand there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took
 41515	place.
 41516	
 41517	Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the
 41518	KolochÃ¡, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt
 41519	but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that
 41520	the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the
 41521	battle would have taken place where we expected it. In that case
 41522	we should probably have defended the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubtâour left
 41523	flankâstill more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the
 41524	center or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on the
 41525	twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. But as the
 41526	attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of
 41527	our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at GridnÃ«va), and
 41528	as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a
 41529	general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first
 41530	and chief action of the battle of BorodinÃ³ was already lost on the
 41531	twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the
 41532	twenty-sixth.
 41533	
 41534	After the loss of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the
 41535	morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and
 41536	were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to
 41537	be.
 41538	
 41539	Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,
 41540	unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was
 41541	increased by the fact that the Russian commandersânot having fully
 41542	realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left
 41543	flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from
 41544	right to leftâmaintained their extended position from the village of
 41545	NÃ³voe to UtÃ­tsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to
 41546	left during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle
 41547	the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left
 41548	flank with but half as many men. (Poniatowskiâs action against UtÃ­tsa,
 41549	and UvÃ¡rovâs on the right flank against the French, were actions
 41550	distinct from the main course of the battle.) So the battle of BorodinÃ³
 41551	did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commandersâ
 41552	mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian
 41553	army and people) it has been described. The battle of BorodinÃ³ was not
 41554	fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly
 41555	weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the
 41556	ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of BorodinÃ³ on an
 41557	open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous
 41558	as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not
 41559	merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive
 41560	result, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete
 41561	disintegration and flight.
 41562	
 41563	
 41564	
 41565	
 41566	
 41567	CHAPTER XX
 41568	
 41569	On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving MozhÃ¡ysk. At the
 41570	descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the
 41571	town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and
 41572	the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on
 41573	foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by
 41574	its singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who
 41575	had been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers,
 41576	shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The
 41577	carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying
 41578	or sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep
 41579	incline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with
 41580	rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to
 41581	the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost
 41582	all of them stared with naÃ¯ve, childlike curiosity at Pierreâs white hat
 41583	and green swallow-tail coat.
 41584	
 41585	Pierreâs coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to
 41586	one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill
 41587	with its singers, surrounded Pierreâs carriage and blocked the road.
 41588	Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which
 41589	the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into
 41590	the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierreâs head was
 41591	the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the
 41592	carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The
 41593	driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one
 41594	of its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his
 41595	little horse.
 41596	
 41597	One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following
 41598	the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to
 41599	look at Pierre.
 41600	
 41601	âI say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to
 41602	Moscow?â he asked.
 41603	
 41604	Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was
 41605	looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded,
 41606	now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men
 41607	were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had
 41608	probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags
 41609	and one cheek was swollen to the size of a babyâs head. His nose
 41610	and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the
 41611	cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired
 41612	recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked
 41613	at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his
 41614	face was not visible. The cavalry singers were passing close by:
 41615	
 41616	   Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,
 41617	   Living in a foreign land...
 41618	
 41619	they sang their soldiersâ dance song.
 41620	
 41621	As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the
 41622	metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of
 41623	the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of
 41624	merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the
 41625	panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.
 41626	
 41627	The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry
 41628	singers.
 41629	
 41630	âOh, the coxcombs!â he muttered reproachfully.
 41631	
 41632	âItâs not the soldiers only, but Iâve seen peasants today, too....
 41633	The peasantsâeven they have to go,â said the soldier behind the cart,
 41634	addressing Pierre with a sad smile. âNo distinctions made nowadays....
 41635	They want the whole nation to fall on themâin a word, itâs Moscow! They
 41636	want to make an end of it.â
 41637	
 41638	In spite of the obscurity of the soldierâs words Pierre understood what
 41639	he wanted to say and nodded approval.
 41640	
 41641	The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.
 41642	
 41643	He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only
 41644	saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different
 41645	branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white
 41646	hat and green tail coat.
 41647	
 41648	Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and
 41649	eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was
 41650	driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon,
 41651	and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driverâs
 41652	seat to pull up.
 41653	
 41654	âCount! Your excellency, how come you to be here?â asked the doctor.
 41655	
 41656	âWell, you know, I wanted to see...â
 41657	
 41658	âYes, yes, there will be something to see....â
 41659	
 41660	Pierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of
 41661	taking part in a battle.
 41662	
 41663	The doctor advised him to apply direct to KutÃºzov.
 41664	
 41665	âWhy should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?â he
 41666	said, exchanging glances with his young companion. âAnyhow his Serene
 41667	Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. Thatâs what you must
 41668	do.â
 41669	
 41670	The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.
 41671	
 41672	âYou think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is
 41673	exactly?â said Pierre.
 41674	
 41675	âThe position?â repeated the doctor. âWell, thatâs not my line. Drive
 41676	past TatÃ¡rinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock
 41677	and youâll see.â
 41678	
 41679	âCan one see from there?... If you would...â
 41680	
 41681	But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.
 41682	
 41683	âI would go with you but on my honor Iâm up to hereââand he pointed to
 41684	his throat. âIâm galloping to the commander of the corps. How do matters
 41685	stand?... You know, Count, thereâll be a battle tomorrow. Out of an army
 41686	of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded,
 41687	and we havenât stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for
 41688	six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as
 41689	wellâwe must manage as best we can!â
 41690	
 41691	The strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who
 41692	had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had
 41693	noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death
 41694	amazed Pierre.
 41695	
 41696	âThey may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?â
 41697	And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the MozhÃ¡ysk hill,
 41698	the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the
 41699	sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.
 41700	
 41701	âThe cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment
 41702	think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. Yet from
 41703	among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my
 41704	hat! Strange!â thought Pierre, continuing his way to TatÃ¡rinova.
 41705	
 41706	In front of a landownerâs house to the left of the road stood carriages,
 41707	wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The commander in chief
 41708	was putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and
 41709	hardly any of the staff were thereâthey had gone to the church service.
 41710	Pierre drove on toward GÃ³rki.
 41711	
 41712	When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he
 41713	saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with
 41714	crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and
 41715	perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the
 41716	right of the road.
 41717	
 41718	Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth
 41719	along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.
 41720	
 41721	Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing
 41722	these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their
 41723	position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at
 41724	MozhÃ¡ysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: âThey
 41725	want the whole nation to fall on them.â The sight of these bearded
 41726	peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots
 41727	and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward
 41728	the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed
 41729	Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment
 41730	than anything he had yet seen or heard.
 41731	
 41732	
 41733	
 41734	
 41735	
 41736	CHAPTER XXI
 41737	
 41738	Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen,
 41739	ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield
 41740	could be seen.
 41741	
 41742	It was about eleven oâclock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and
 41743	behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like
 41744	an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.
 41745	
 41746	From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the SmolÃ©nsk
 41747	highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five
 41748	hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was BorodinÃ³.
 41749	Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding
 41750	down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of ValÃºevo visible
 41751	about four miles away, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond ValÃºevo
 41752	the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in
 41753	the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the
 41754	cross and belfry of the KolochÃ¡ Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and
 41755	there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the
 41756	forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite
 41757	masses of troopsâours and the enemyâs. The ground to the rightâalong the
 41758	course of the KolochÃ¡ and MoskvÃ¡ riversâwas broken and hilly. Between
 41759	the hollows the villages of BezÃºbova and ZakhÃ¡rino showed in the
 41760	distance. On the left the ground was more level; there were fields of
 41761	grain, and the smoking ruins of SemÃ«novsk, which had been burned down,
 41762	could be seen.
 41763	
 41764	All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the
 41765	right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere
 41766	could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields,
 41767	meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and
 41768	streams; and try as he would he could descry no military âpositionâ in
 41769	this place which teemed with life, nor could he even distinguish our
 41770	troops from the enemyâs.
 41771	
 41772	âI must ask someone who knows,â he thought, and addressed an officer who
 41773	was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.
 41774	
 41775	âMay I ask you,â said Pierre, âwhat village that is in front?â
 41776	
 41777	âBÃºrdino, isnât it?â said the officer, turning to his companion.
 41778	
 41779	âBorodinÃ³,â the other corrected him.
 41780	
 41781	The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to
 41782	Pierre.
 41783	
 41784	âAre those our men there?â Pierre inquired.
 41785	
 41786	âYes, and there, further on, are the French,â said the officer. âThere
 41787	they are, there... you can see them.â
 41788	
 41789	âWhere? Where?â asked Pierre.
 41790	
 41791	âOne can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!â
 41792	
 41793	The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left
 41794	beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre
 41795	had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.
 41796	
 41797	âAh, those are the French! And over there?...â Pierre pointed to a knoll
 41798	on the left, near which some troops could be seen.
 41799	
 41800	âThose are ours.â
 41801	
 41802	âAh, ours! And there?...â Pierre pointed to another knoll in the
 41803	distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow
 41804	where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible.
 41805	
 41806	âThatâs his again,â said the officer. (It was the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt.)
 41807	âIt was ours yesterday, but now it is his.â
 41808	
 41809	âThen how about our position?â
 41810	
 41811	âOur position?â replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. âI
 41812	can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our
 41813	entrenchments. There, you see? Thereâs our center, at BorodinÃ³, just
 41814	there,â and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white
 41815	church. âThatâs where one crosses the KolochÃ¡. You see down there where
 41816	the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, thereâs the bridge. Thatâs our
 41817	center. Our right flank is over thereââhe pointed sharply to the right,
 41818	far away in the broken groundââThatâs where the MoskvÃ¡ River is, and
 41819	we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones. The left
 41820	flank...â here the officer paused. âWell, you see, thatâs difficult to
 41821	explain.... Yesterday our left flank was there at ShevÃ¡rdino, you see,
 41822	where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wingânow it is over
 41823	there, do you see that village and the smoke? Thatâs SemÃ«novsk, yes,
 41824	there,â he pointed to RaÃ©vskiâs knoll. âBut the battle will hardly
 41825	be there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will
 41826	probably pass round to the right of the MoskvÃ¡. But wherever it may be,
 41827	many a man will be missing tomorrow!â he remarked.
 41828	
 41829	An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving
 41830	these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking, but
 41831	at this point, evidently not liking the officerâs remark, interrupted
 41832	him.
 41833	
 41834	âGabions must be sent for,â said he sternly.
 41835	
 41836	The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might
 41837	think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak
 41838	of it.
 41839	
 41840	âWell, send number three company again,â the officer replied hurriedly.
 41841	
 41842	âAnd you, are you one of the doctors?â
 41843	
 41844	âNo, Iâve come on my own,â answered Pierre, and he went down the hill
 41845	again, passing the militiamen.
 41846	
 41847	âOh, those damned fellows!â muttered the officer who followed him,
 41848	holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.
 41849	
 41850	âThere they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... Theyâll be
 41851	here in a minute...â voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers,
 41852	soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.
 41853	
 41854	A church procession was coming up the hill from BorodinÃ³. First along
 41855	the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms
 41856	reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.
 41857	
 41858	Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the
 41859	procession.
 41860	
 41861	âThey are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of God!â
 41862	someone cried.
 41863	
 41864	âThe SmolÃ©nsk Mother of God,â another corrected him.
 41865	
 41866	The militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who had
 41867	been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the
 41868	church procession. Following the battalion that marched along the dusty
 41869	road came priests in their vestmentsâone little old man in a hood with
 41870	attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large,
 41871	dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had
 41872	been brought from SmolÃ©nsk and had since accompanied the army. Behind,
 41873	before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked,
 41874	ran, and bowed to the ground.
 41875	
 41876	At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had
 41877	been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by
 41878	others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot
 41879	rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with
 41880	the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.
 41881	The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd
 41882	of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon.
 41883	Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot
 41884	reserved for them. A bald general with a St. Georgeâs Cross on his neck
 41885	stood just behind the priestâs back, and without crossing himself (he
 41886	was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which
 41887	he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the
 41888	patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial
 41889	pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest
 41890	while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre
 41891	recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not
 41892	look at themâhis whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious
 41893	expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were
 41894	all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were
 41895	singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and
 41896	mechanically to sing: âSave from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of
 41897	God,â and the priest and deacon chimed in: âFor to Thee under God we all
 41898	flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,â there again kindled in
 41899	all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity
 41900	of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of
 41901	the hill at MozhÃ¡ysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met
 41902	that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back,
 41903	and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.
 41904	
 41905	The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.
 41906	Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way
 41907	was made for him, was approaching the icon.
 41908	
 41909	It was KutÃºzov, who had been riding round the position and on his way
 41910	back to TatÃ¡rinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre
 41911	recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him
 41912	from everybody else.
 41913	
 41914	With a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body,
 41915	with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the
 41916	eye he had lost, KutÃºzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into
 41917	the crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an
 41918	accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and
 41919	bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind KutÃºzov was Bennigsen and
 41920	the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted
 41921	the attention of all the superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers
 41922	continued their prayers without looking at him.
 41923	
 41924	When the service was over, KutÃºzov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily
 41925	to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to
 41926	rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His
 41927	white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as
 41928	a child does with naÃ¯vely pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched
 41929	the ground with his hand. The other generals followed his example,
 41930	then the officers, and after them with excited faces, pressing on one
 41931	another, crowding, panting, and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and
 41932	militiamen.
 41933	
 41934	
 41935	
 41936	
 41937	
 41938	CHAPTER XXII
 41939	
 41940	Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.
 41941	
 41942	âCount Peter KirÃ­lovich! How did you get here?â said a voice.
 41943	
 41944	Pierre looked round. BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, brushing his knees with his hand
 41945	(he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon),
 41946	came up to him smiling. BorÃ­s was elegantly dressed, with a slightly
 41947	martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like
 41948	KutÃºzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.
 41949	
 41950	Meanwhile KutÃºzov had reached the village and seated himself in the
 41951	shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run
 41952	to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and
 41953	brilliant suite surrounded him.
 41954	
 41955	The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped
 41956	some thirty paces from KutÃºzov, talking to BorÃ­s.
 41957	
 41958	He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
 41959	position.
 41960	
 41961	âThis is what you must do,â said BorÃ­s. âI will do the honors of the
 41962	camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen
 41963	will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; Iâll mention it to him.
 41964	But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us. We are
 41965	just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night
 41966	with me and weâll arrange a game of cards. Of course you know DmÃ­tri
 41967	SergÃ©evich? Those are his quarters,â and he pointed to the third house
 41968	in the village of GÃ³rki.
 41969	
 41970	âBut I should like to see the right flank. They say itâs very strong,â
 41971	said Pierre. âI should like to start from the MoskvÃ¡ River and ride
 41972	round the whole position.â
 41973	
 41974	âWell, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.â
 41975	
 41976	âYes, yes. But where is Prince BolkÃ³nskiâs regiment? Can you point it
 41977	out to me?â
 41978	
 41979	âPrince Andrewâs? We shall pass it and Iâll take you to him.â
 41980	
 41981	âWhat about the left flank?â asked Pierre
 41982	
 41983	âTo tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our
 41984	left flank is in,â said BorÃ­s confidentially lowering his voice. âIt is
 41985	not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll
 41986	quite differently, but...â BorÃ­s shrugged his shoulders, âhis Serene
 41987	Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...â but
 41988	BorÃ­s did not finish, for at that moment KaysÃ¡rov, KutÃºzovâs adjutant,
 41989	came up to Pierre. âAh, KaysÃ¡rov!â said BorÃ­s, addressing him with an
 41990	unembarrassed smile, âI was just trying to explain our position to
 41991	the count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the
 41992	intentions of the French!â
 41993	
 41994	âYou mean the left flank?â asked KaysÃ¡rov.
 41995	
 41996	âYes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.â
 41997	
 41998	Though KutÃºzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, BorÃ­s
 41999	had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had
 42000	established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom BorÃ­s
 42001	had been in attendance, considered young Prince DrubetskÃ³y an invaluable
 42002	man.
 42003	
 42004	In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: KutÃºzovâs
 42005	party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. BorÃ­s belonged to the
 42006	latter and no one else, while showing servile respect to KutÃºzov, could
 42007	so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that
 42008	Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come
 42009	when KutÃºzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even
 42010	if KutÃºzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by
 42011	Bennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for
 42012	tomorrowâs action, and new men would come to the front. So BorÃ­s was
 42013	full of nervous vivacity all day.
 42014	
 42015	After KaysÃ¡rov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not
 42016	time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon
 42017	him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed
 42018	animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of
 42019	the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions
 42020	of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different
 42021	expression he saw on other facesâan expression that spoke not of
 42022	personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death.
 42023	KutÃºzov noticed Pierreâs figure and the group gathered round him.
 42024	
 42025	âCall him to me,â said KutÃºzov.
 42026	
 42027	An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highnessâ wish, and Pierre went
 42028	toward KutÃºzovâs bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was
 42029	DÃ³lokhov.
 42030	
 42031	âHow did that fellow get here?â asked Pierre.
 42032	
 42033	âHeâs a creature that wriggles in anywhere!â was the answer. âHe
 42034	has been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. Heâs been
 42035	proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemyâs picket
 42036	line at night.... Heâs a brave fellow.â
 42037	
 42038	Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to KutÃºzov.
 42039	
 42040	âI concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send
 42041	me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldnât
 42042	lose anything...â DÃ³lokhov was saying.
 42043	
 42044	âYes, yes.â
 42045	
 42046	âBut if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland
 42047	for which I am ready to die.â
 42048	
 42049	âYes, yes.â
 42050	
 42051	âAnd should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his
 42052	skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene
 42053	Highness.â
 42054	
 42055	âYes... Yes...â KutÃºzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and
 42056	more as he looked at Pierre.
 42057	
 42058	Just then BorÃ­s, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to
 42059	Pierreâs side near KutÃºzov and in a most natural manner, without
 42060	raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted
 42061	conversation:
 42062	
 42063	âThe militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What
 42064	heroism, Count!â
 42065	
 42066	BorÃ­s evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his
 42067	Serene Highness. He knew KutÃºzovâs attention would be caught by those
 42068	words, and so it was.
 42069	
 42070	âWhat are you saying about the militia?â he asked BorÃ­s.
 42071	
 42072	âPreparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highnessâfor deathâthey have put on
 42073	clean shirts.â
 42074	
 42075	âAh... a wonderful, a matchless people!â said KutÃºzov; and he closed his
 42076	eyes and swayed his head. âA matchless people!â he repeated with a sigh.
 42077	
 42078	âSo you want to smell gunpowder?â he said to Pierre. âYes, itâs a
 42079	pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wifeâs adorers. Is
 42080	she well? My quarters are at your service.â
 42081	
 42082	And as often happens with old people, KutÃºzov began looking about
 42083	absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.
 42084	
 42085	Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew
 42086	KaysÃ¡rov, his adjutantâs brother.
 42087	
 42088	âThose verses... those verses of MÃ¡rinâs... how do they go, eh? Those he
 42089	wrote about GerÃ¡kov: âLectures for the corps inditingâ... Recite them,
 42090	recite them!â said he, evidently preparing to laugh.
 42091	
 42092	KaysÃ¡rov recited.... KutÃºzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of
 42093	the verses.
 42094	
 42095	When Pierre had left KutÃºzov, DÃ³lokhov came up to him and took his hand.
 42096	
 42097	âI am very glad to meet you here, Count,â he said aloud, regardless
 42098	of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn
 42099	tone. âOn the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to
 42100	survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the
 42101	misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to
 42102	have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me.â
 42103	
 42104	Pierre looked at DÃ³lokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him.
 42105	With tears in his eyes DÃ³lokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.
 42106	
 42107	BorÃ­s said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to
 42108	Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.
 42109	
 42110	âIt will interest you,â said he.
 42111	
 42112	âYes, very much,â replied Pierre.
 42113	
 42114	Half an hour later KutÃºzov left for TatÃ¡rinova, and Bennigsen and his
 42115	suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line.
 42116	
 42117	
 42118	
 42119	
 42120	
 42121	CHAPTER XXIII
 42122	
 42123	From GÃ³rki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when
 42124	they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as
 42125	being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay
 42126	lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of
 42127	BorodinÃ³ and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of
 42128	troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging.
 42129	This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as
 42130	the RaÃ©vski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special
 42131	attention to it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to
 42132	him than any other spot on the plain of BorodinÃ³.
 42133	
 42134	They then crossed the hollow to SemÃ«novsk, where the soldiers were
 42135	dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode
 42136	downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by
 42137	hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows
 42138	of the plowed land, and reached some flÃ¨ches * which were still being
 42139	dug.
 42140	
 42141	    * A kind of entrenchment.
 42142	
 42143	At the flÃ¨ches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the ShevÃ¡rdino
 42144	Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several
 42145	horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or
 42146	Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of
 42147	horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the
 42148	scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men
 42149	rode away from the mound and disappeared.
 42150	
 42151	Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining
 42152	the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each
 42153	faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but
 42154	was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the
 42155	task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and,
 42156	noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:
 42157	
 42158	âI donât think this interests you?â
 42159	
 42160	âOn the contrary itâs very interesting!â replied Pierre not quite
 42161	truthfully.
 42162	
 42163	From the flÃ¨ches they rode still farther to the left, along a road
 42164	winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the
 42165	wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of
 42166	the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front
 42167	of them for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only
 42168	when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear
 42169	in the thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half
 42170	they came out on a glade where troops of TÃºchkovâs corps were stationed
 42171	to defend the left flank.
 42172	
 42173	Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with
 42174	much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military
 42175	importance. In front of TÃºchkovâs troops was some high ground not
 42176	occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying
 42177	that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around
 42178	unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed
 42179	the same opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they
 42180	were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered
 42181	the troops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank
 42182	increased Pierreâs doubt of his own capacity to understand military
 42183	matters. Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the
 42184	position of the troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and
 42185	shared their opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand
 42186	how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross
 42187	and palpable a blunder.
 42188	
 42189	Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed,
 42190	put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as
 42191	an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an
 42192	approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved
 42193	the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the
 42194	matter to the commander in chief.
 42195	
 42196	
 42197	
 42198	
 42199	
 42200	CHAPTER XXIV
 42201	
 42202	On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his
 42203	elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of KnyazkÃ³vo at the further
 42204	end of his regimentâs encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he
 42205	could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches
 42206	with their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of
 42207	oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of
 42208	campfiresâthe soldiersâ kitchens.
 42209	
 42210	Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to
 42211	him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as
 42212	he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.
 42213	
 42214	He had received and given the orders for next dayâs battle and had
 42215	nothing more to do. But his thoughtsâthe simplest, clearest, and
 42216	therefore most terrible thoughtsâwould give him no peace. He knew that
 42217	tomorrowâs battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken
 42218	part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of death
 42219	presented itself to himânot in relation to any worldly matter or with
 42220	reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to himself, to
 42221	his own soulâvividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty. And
 42222	from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and
 42223	preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without
 42224	shadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline. All life
 42225	appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been
 42226	gazing by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those
 42227	badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. âYes,
 42228	yes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured,
 42229	and tormented me,â said he to himself, passing in review the principal
 42230	pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold
 42231	white daylight of his clear perception of death. âThere they are, those
 42232	rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious.
 42233	Glory, the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itselfâhow
 42234	important these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they
 42235	seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the
 42236	cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.â The
 42237	three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his
 42238	love for a woman, his fatherâs death, and the French invasion which had
 42239	overrun half Russia. âLove... that little girl who seemed to me brimming
 42240	over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made romantic plans
 42241	of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I was!â he said aloud
 42242	bitterly. âAh me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her
 42243	faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove
 42244	in the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler
 42245	really.... It was all very simple and horrible.â
 42246	
 42247	âWhen my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his
 42248	land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside,
 42249	unconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path,
 42250	and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says
 42251	it is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when he is not
 42252	here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is the trial
 42253	intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I
 42254	shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own
 42255	men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them
 42256	did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by head and heels
 42257	and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses, and new
 42258	conditions of life will arise, which will seem quite ordinary to others
 42259	and about which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist....â
 42260	
 42261	He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their
 42262	motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. âTo die... to be
 42263	killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still
 42264	be, but no me....â
 42265	
 42266	And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the
 42267	smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed
 42268	terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose
 42269	quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.
 42270	
 42271	After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. âWhoâs that?â
 42272	he cried.
 42273	
 42274	The red-nosed Captain TimÃ³khin, formerly DÃ³lokhovâs squadron commander,
 42275	but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the
 42276	shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.
 42277	
 42278	Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come
 42279	about, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss
 42280	them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.
 42281	
 42282	âDevil take it!â said the voice of a man stumbling over something.
 42283	
 42284	Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped
 42285	over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was
 42286	unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general,
 42287	and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of
 42288	his last visit to Moscow.
 42289	
 42290	âYou? What a surprise!â said he. âWhat brings you here? This is
 42291	unexpected!â
 42292	
 42293	As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldnessâthey
 42294	expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached
 42295	the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrewâs face he felt
 42296	constrained and ill at ease.
 42297	
 42298	âI have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,â said
 42299	Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word
 42300	âinteresting.â âI wish to see the battle.â
 42301	
 42302	âOh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they
 42303	stop it?â said Prince Andrew sarcastically. âWell, and howâs Moscow? And
 42304	my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?â he asked seriously.
 42305	
 42306	âYes, they have. Julie DrubetskÃ¡ya told me so. I went to see them, but
 42307	missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.â
 42308	
 42309	
 42310	
 42311	
 42312	
 42313	CHAPTER XXV
 42314	
 42315	The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently
 42316	reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have
 42317	tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with
 42318	surprise at Pierreâs huge stout figure and listened to his talk of
 42319	Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince
 42320	Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre
 42321	addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.
 42322	
 42323	âSo you understand the whole position of our troops?â Prince Andrew
 42324	interrupted him.
 42325	
 42326	âYesâthat is, how do you mean?â said Pierre. âNot being a military man
 42327	I canât say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general
 42328	position.â
 42329	
 42330	âWell, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,â said
 42331	Prince Andrew.
 42332	
 42333	âOh!â said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince
 42334	Andrew. âWell, and what do you think of KutÃºzovâs appointment?â he
 42335	asked.
 42336	
 42337	âI was very glad of his appointment, thatâs all I know,â replied Prince
 42338	Andrew.
 42339	
 42340	âAnd tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying
 42341	heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?â
 42342	
 42343	âAsk them,â replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.
 42344	
 42345	Pierre looked at TimÃ³khin with the condescendingly interrogative smile
 42346	with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.
 42347	
 42348	âWe see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your
 42349	excellency,â said TimÃ³khin timidly, and continually turning to glance at
 42350	his colonel.
 42351	
 42352	âWhy so?â asked Pierre.
 42353	
 42354	âWell, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when
 42355	we were retreating from SventsyÃ¡ni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp
 42356	of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all;
 42357	wasnât it so, your excellency?â and again TimÃ³khin turned to the prince.
 42358	âBut we darenât. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for
 42359	that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became
 42360	straightforward. Now we see light....â
 42361	
 42362	âThen why was it forbidden?â
 42363	
 42364	TimÃ³khin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer
 42365	such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.
 42366	
 42367	âWhy, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the
 42368	enemy,â said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. âIt is very sound:
 42369	one canât permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to
 42370	marauding. At SmolÃ©nsk too he judged correctly that the French might
 42371	outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand
 42372	this,â cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him
 42373	involuntarily: âhe could not understand that there, for the first time,
 42374	we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the
 42375	men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for
 42376	two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. He
 42377	ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing.
 42378	He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could,
 42379	he thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is
 42380	unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and
 42381	accurately as every German has to. How can I explain?... Well, say your
 42382	father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your
 42383	fatherâs requirements better than you could, then itâs all right to let
 42384	him serve. But if your father is mortally sick youâll send the valet
 42385	away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands,
 42386	and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could.
 42387	So it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could
 42388	serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger
 42389	she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been making him
 42390	out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the only result will
 42391	be that afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will make
 42392	him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still
 42393	more unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German.â
 42394	
 42395	âAnd they say heâs a skillful commander,â rejoined Pierre.
 42396	
 42397	âI donât understand what is meant by âa skillful commander,ââ replied
 42398	Prince Andrew ironically.
 42399	
 42400	âA skillful commander?â replied Pierre. âWhy, one who foresees all
 42401	contingencies... and foresees the adversaryâs intentions.â
 42402	
 42403	âBut thatâs impossible,â said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter
 42404	settled long ago.
 42405	
 42406	Pierre looked at him in surprise.
 42407	
 42408	âAnd yet they say that war is like a game of chess?â he remarked.
 42409	
 42410	âYes,â replied Prince Andrew, âbut with this little difference, that
 42411	in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not
 42412	limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always
 42413	stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while
 42414	in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes
 42415	weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can
 42416	never be known to anyone. Believe me,â he went on, âif things
 42417	depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making
 42418	arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in
 42419	the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrowâs
 42420	battle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends,
 42421	and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers,
 42422	and least of all on position.â
 42423	
 42424	âBut on what then?â
 42425	
 42426	âOn the feeling that is in me and in him,â he pointed to TimÃ³khin, âand
 42427	in each soldier.â
 42428	
 42429	Prince Andrew glanced at TimÃ³khin, who looked at his commander in alarm
 42430	and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity
 42431	Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from
 42432	expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.
 42433	
 42434	âA battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose
 42435	the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours,
 42436	but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle,
 42437	and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for
 42438	there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could.
 42439	âWeâve lost, so let us run,â and we ran. If we had not said that till
 42440	the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we
 42441	shanât say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the
 42442	right flank too extended,â he went on. âThatâs all nonsense, thereâs
 42443	nothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most
 42444	diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that
 42445	our men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is
 42446	killed, but all that is being done at present is only play. The fact is
 42447	that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only
 42448	do not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned with their own
 42449	petty interests.â
 42450	
 42451	âAt such a moment?â said Pierre reproachfully.
 42452	
 42453	âAt such a moment!â Prince Andrew repeated. âTo them it is only a moment
 42454	affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross
 42455	or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred
 42456	thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and
 42457	the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side
 42458	that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you
 42459	like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at
 42460	the top may make, we shall win tomorrowâs battle. Tomorrow, happen what
 42461	may, we shall win!â
 42462	
 42463	âThere now, your excellency! Thatâs the truth, the real truth,â said
 42464	TimÃ³khin. âWho would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion,
 42465	believe me, wouldnât drink their vodka! âItâs not the day for that!â
 42466	they say.â
 42467	
 42468	All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed
 42469	with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone
 42470	Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation
 42471	when they heard the clatter of three horsesâ hoofs on the road not far
 42472	from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized
 42473	Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by
 42474	continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these
 42475	words:
 42476	
 42477	âDer Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug
 42478	Preis geben,â * said one of them.
 42479	
 42480	     * âThe war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently
 42481	     commend that view.â
 42482	
 42483	
 42484	âOh, ja,â said the other, âder Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwÃ¤chen,
 42485	so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung
 42486	nehmen.â *
 42487	
 42488	     * âOh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of
 42489	     course one cannot take into account the loss of private
 42490	     individuals.â
 42491	
 42492	
 42493	âOh, no,â agreed the other.
 42494	
 42495	âExtend widely!â said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had
 42496	ridden past. âIn that âextendâ were my father, son, and sister, at Bald
 42497	Hills. Thatâs all the same to him! Thatâs what I was saying to youâthose
 42498	German gentlemen wonât win the battle tomorrow but will only make all
 42499	the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but
 42500	theories not worth an empty eggshell and havenât in their hearts the one
 42501	thing needed tomorrowâthat which TimÃ³khin has. They have yielded up all
 42502	Europe to him, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!â and again
 42503	his voice grew shrill.
 42504	
 42505	âSo you think we shall win tomorrowâs battle?â asked Pierre.
 42506	
 42507	âYes, yes,â answered Prince Andrew absently. âOne thing I would do if
 42508	I had the power,â he began again, âI would not take prisoners. Why take
 42509	prisoners? Itâs chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on
 42510	their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me
 42511	every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals.
 42512	And so thinks TimÃ³khin and the whole army. They should be executed!
 42513	Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been
 42514	said at Tilsit.â
 42515	
 42516	âYes, yes,â muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew.
 42517	âI quite agree with you!â
 42518	
 42519	The question that had perturbed Pierre on the MozhÃ¡ysk hill and all
 42520	that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now
 42521	understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the
 42522	impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and
 42523	stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up
 42524	for him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in
 42525	physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen,
 42526	and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as
 42527	it were lightheartedly.
 42528	
 42529	âNot take prisoners,â Prince Andrew continued: âThat by itself would
 42530	quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have
 42531	played at warâthatâs whatâs vile! We play at magnanimity and all that
 42532	stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and
 42533	sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she
 42534	is so kindhearted that she canât look at blood, but enjoys eating the
 42535	calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of
 42536	chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. Itâs
 42537	all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged
 42538	us and we humbugged them. They plunder other peopleâs houses, issue
 42539	false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my
 42540	father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no
 42541	prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have
 42542	through the same sufferings...â
 42543	
 42544	Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or
 42545	not Moscow was taken as SmolÃ©nsk had been, was suddenly checked in his
 42546	speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a
 42547	few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips
 42548	quivered as he began speaking.
 42549	
 42550	âIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only
 42551	when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would
 42552	not be war because Paul IvÃ¡novich had offended Michael IvÃ¡novich. And
 42553	when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the
 42554	determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these
 42555	Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow
 42556	him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia
 42557	without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in
 42558	life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to
 42559	accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in
 42560	that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is
 42561	now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military
 42562	calling is the most highly honored.
 42563	
 42564	âBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the
 42565	habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war
 42566	are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a countryâs
 42567	inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud
 42568	and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class
 42569	are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance,
 42570	cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the
 42571	highest class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese,
 42572	wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the
 42573	highest rewards.
 42574	
 42575	âThey meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill
 42576	and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for
 42577	having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they
 42578	announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed
 42579	the greater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear
 42580	them?â exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. âAh, my
 42581	friend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have
 42582	begun to understand too much. And it doesnât do for man to taste of the
 42583	tree of knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, itâs not for long!â he
 42584	added.
 42585	
 42586	âHowever, youâre sleepy, and itâs time for me to sleep. Go back to
 42587	GÃ³rki!â said Prince Andrew suddenly.
 42588	
 42589	âOh no!â Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,
 42590	compassionate eyes.
 42591	
 42592	âGo, go! Before a battle one must have oneâs sleep out,â repeated Prince
 42593	Andrew.
 42594	
 42595	He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. âGood-by, be
 42596	off!â he shouted. âWhether we meet again or not...â and turning away
 42597	hurriedly he entered the shed.
 42598	
 42599	It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the
 42600	expression of Prince Andrewâs face was angry or tender.
 42601	
 42602	For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow
 42603	him or go away. âNo, he does not want it!â Pierre concluded. âAnd I know
 42604	that this is our last meeting!â He sighed deeply and rode back to GÃ³rki.
 42605	
 42606	On re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could
 42607	not sleep.
 42608	
 42609	He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On
 42610	one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening
 42611	in Petersburg. NatÃ¡sha with animated and excited face was telling him
 42612	how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost
 42613	her way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of
 42614	the forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and
 42615	constantly interrupted her story to say: âNo, I canât! Iâm not telling
 42616	it right; no, you donât understand,â though he encouraged her by saying
 42617	that he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to
 42618	say. But NatÃ¡sha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that
 42619	they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced
 42620	that day and wished to convey. âHe was such a delightful old man, and
 42621	it was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I canât
 42622	describe it,â she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew smiled
 42623	now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes. âI
 42624	understood her,â he thought. âI not only understood her, but it was just
 42625	that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frankness of soulâthat
 42626	very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her bodyâit was that
 42627	soul I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily...â and suddenly
 42628	he remembered how his love had ended. âHe did not need anything of that
 42629	kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. He only saw in
 42630	her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite
 42631	his fate. And I?... and he is still alive and gay!â
 42632	
 42633	Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began
 42634	pacing up and down in front of the shed.
 42635	
 42636	
 42637	
 42638	
 42639	
 42640	CHAPTER XXVI
 42641	
 42642	On August 25, the eve of the battle of BorodinÃ³, M. de Beausset, prefect
 42643	of the French Emperorâs palace, arrived at Napoleonâs quarters at
 42644	ValÃºevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from
 42645	Madrid.
 42646	
 42647	Donning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had
 42648	brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first
 42649	compartment of Napoleonâs tent, where he began opening the box while
 42650	conversing with Napoleonâs aides-de-camp who surrounded him.
 42651	
 42652	Fabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some
 42653	generals of his acquaintance.
 42654	
 42655	The Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his
 42656	toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and
 42657	now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing
 42658	him down. Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle,
 42659	was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperorâs pampered body with an
 42660	expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau
 42661	de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleonâs short hair was wet and
 42662	matted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed
 42663	physical satisfaction. âGo on, harder, go on!â he muttered to the valet
 42664	who was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp,
 42665	who had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of
 42666	prisoners taken in yesterdayâs action, was standing by the door after
 42667	delivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon,
 42668	frowning, looked at him from under his brows.
 42669	
 42670	âNo prisoners!â said he, repeating the aide-de-campâs words. âThey
 42671	are forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian
 42672	army.... Go on... harder, harder!â he muttered, hunching his back and
 42673	presenting his fat shoulders.
 42674	
 42675	âAll right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,â he said,
 42676	nodding to the aide-de-camp.
 42677	
 42678	âYes, sire,â and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the
 42679	tent.
 42680	
 42681	Two valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of
 42682	the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.
 42683	
 42684	De Beaussetâs hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present
 42685	he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of the
 42686	entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected
 42687	rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.
 42688	
 42689	Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were
 42690	not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him
 42691	a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to
 42692	him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him
 42693	of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at
 42694	the other end of Europe, with but one thoughtâto be worthy of their
 42695	Emperorâand but one fearâto fail to please him. The result of that
 42696	battle had been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during
 42697	Fabvierâs account, as if he had not expected that matters could go
 42698	otherwise in his absence.
 42699	
 42700	âI must make up for that in Moscow,â said Napoleon. âIâll see you
 42701	later,â he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had
 42702	prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered
 42703	it with a cloth.
 42704	
 42705	De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the
 42706	old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,
 42707	presenting an envelope.
 42708	
 42709	Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.
 42710	
 42711	âYou have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?â he
 42712	asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial
 42713	tone.
 42714	
 42715	âSire, all Paris regrets your absence,â replied de Beausset as was
 42716	proper.
 42717	
 42718	But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this
 42719	kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was
 42720	pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.
 42721	
 42722	âI am very sorry to have made you travel so far,â said he.
 42723	
 42724	âSire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,â
 42725	replied de Beausset.
 42726	
 42727	Napoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the
 42728	right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a
 42729	gold snuffbox, which he took.
 42730	
 42731	âYes, it has happened luckily for you,â he said, raising the open
 42732	snuffbox to his nose. âYou are fond of travel, and in three days you
 42733	will see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital.
 42734	You will have a pleasant journey.â
 42735	
 42736	De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of
 42737	which he had not till then been aware).
 42738	
 42739	âHa, whatâs this?â asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were
 42740	looking at something concealed under a cloth.
 42741	
 42742	With courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his
 42743	back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the
 42744	same time, and said:
 42745	
 42746	âA present to Your Majesty from the Empress.â
 42747	
 42748	It was a portrait, painted in bright colors by GÃ©rard, of the son borne
 42749	to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for
 42750	some reason everyone called âThe King of Rome.â
 42751	
 42752	A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine
 42753	Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the
 42754	terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.
 42755	
 42756	Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting
 42757	the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory
 42758	apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in
 42759	Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.
 42760	
 42761	âThe King of Rome!â he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful
 42762	gesture. âAdmirable!â
 42763	
 42764	With the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of
 42765	his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look
 42766	of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would be
 42767	historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be best for himâwhose
 42768	grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial
 42769	globeâto show, in contrast to that grandeur, the simplest paternal
 42770	tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round at a
 42771	chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and sat down on it
 42772	before the portrait. At a single gesture from him everyone went out on
 42773	tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and his emotion.
 42774	
 42775	Having sat still for a while he touchedâhimself not knowing whyâthe
 42776	thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait,
 42777	rose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the
 42778	portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed
 42779	round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of
 42780	Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.
 42781	
 42782	And while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with
 42783	him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the
 42784	officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.
 42785	
 42786	âVive lâEmpereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive lâEmpereur!â came those
 42787	ecstatic cries.
 42788	
 42789	After breakfast Napoleon in de Beaussetâs presence dictated his order of
 42790	the day to the army.
 42791	
 42792	âShort and energetic!â he remarked when he had read over the
 42793	proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It
 42794	ran:
 42795	
 42796	Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on
 42797	you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable
 42798	quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at
 42799	Austerlitz, Friedland, VÃ­tebsk, and SmolÃ©nsk. Let our remotest posterity
 42800	recall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of
 42801	you: âHe was in the great battle before Moscow!â
 42802	
 42803	âBefore Moscow!â repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was
 42804	so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent
 42805	to where the horses stood saddled.
 42806	
 42807	âYour Majesty is too kind!â replied de Beausset to the invitation to
 42808	accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and
 42809	was afraid of doing so.
 42810	
 42811	But Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount. When
 42812	Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his
 42813	sonâs portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.
 42814	
 42815	âTake him away!â he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to
 42816	the portrait. âIt is too soon for him to see a field of battle.â
 42817	
 42818	De Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to
 42819	indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperorâs words.
 42820	
 42821	
 42822	
 42823	
 42824	
 42825	CHAPTER XXVII
 42826	
 42827	On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon spent
 42828	the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans
 42829	submitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his
 42830	generals.
 42831	
 42832	The original line of the Russian forces along the river KolochÃ¡ had
 42833	been dislocated by the capture of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt on the
 42834	twenty-fourth, and part of the lineâthe left flankâhad been drawn back.
 42835	That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground
 42836	was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone,
 42837	military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It would
 42838	seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion,
 42839	nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his
 42840	marshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality
 42841	called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the
 42842	historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded
 42843	Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.
 42844	
 42845	Napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound
 42846	air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously,
 42847	and without communicating to the generals around him the profound
 42848	course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final
 42849	conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion
 42850	from Davout, who was now called Prince dâEckmÃ¼hl, to turn the Russian
 42851	left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without explaining
 42852	why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to attack the
 42853	flÃ¨ches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though
 42854	the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement
 42855	through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.
 42856	
 42857	Having inspected the country opposite the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt, Napoleon
 42858	pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two
 42859	batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian
 42860	entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field
 42861	artillery should be placed.
 42862	
 42863	After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the
 42864	dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.
 42865	
 42866	These dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm
 42867	and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:
 42868	
 42869	At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the
 42870	plain occupied by the Prince dâEckmÃ¼hl will open fire on the opposing
 42871	batteries of the enemy.
 42872	
 42873	At the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps,
 42874	General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campanâs division and all the
 42875	howitzers of Dessaixâs and Friantâs divisions, will move forward, open
 42876	fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemyâs battery, against which
 42877	will operate:
 42878	
 42879	        24 guns of the artillery of the Guards
 42880	        30 guns of Campanâs division
 42881	
 42882	 and     8 guns of Friantâs and Dessaixâs divisions
 42883	        â
 42884	
 42885	 in all 62 guns.
 42886	
 42887	The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General FouchÃ©, will
 42888	place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the
 42889	flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left,
 42890	which will have forty guns in all directed against it.
 42891	
 42892	General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the
 42893	howitzers of the Guardâs artillery against either one or other of the
 42894	entrenchments.
 42895	
 42896	During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood
 42897	on the village and turn the enemyâs position.
 42898	
 42899	General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first
 42900	fortification.
 42901	
 42902	After the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in
 42903	accordance with the enemyâs movements.
 42904	
 42905	The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the
 42906	right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morandâs division and of
 42907	the vice-Kingâs division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack
 42908	commence on the right wing.
 42909	
 42910	The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges,
 42911	advancing to the same heights as Morandâs and Gibrardâs divisions, which
 42912	under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into
 42913	line with the rest of the forces.
 42914	
 42915	All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et
 42916	mÃ©thode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.
 42917	
 42918	The Imperial Camp near MozhÃ¡ysk,
 42919	
 42920	September, 6, 1812.
 42921	
 42922	
 42923	These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows
 42924	oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius,
 42925	related to Napoleonâs orders to deal with four pointsâfour different
 42926	orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.
 42927	
 42928	In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
 42929	spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and FouchÃ©; which
 42930	were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and
 42931	shower shells on the Russian flÃ¨ches and redoubts. This could not be
 42932	done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not
 42933	carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until
 42934	the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleonâs instructions, moved them
 42935	forward.
 42936	
 42937	The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the
 42938	wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done and
 42939	was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the
 42940	wood, met TÃºchkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn
 42941	the Russian position.
 42942	
 42943	The third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to seize
 42944	the first fortification. General Campanâs division did not seize the
 42945	first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood
 42946	it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.
 42947	
 42948	The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (BorodinÃ³)
 42949	and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as
 42950	Morandâs and GÃ©rardâs divisions (for whose movements no directions are
 42951	given), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt
 42952	and come into line with the rest of the forces.
 42953	
 42954	As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible
 42955	sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders
 42956	given him, he was to advance from the left through BorodinÃ³ to the
 42957	redoubt while the divisions of Morand and GÃ©rard were to advance
 42958	simultaneously from the front.
 42959	
 42960	All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could
 42961	not be executed. After passing through BorodinÃ³ the vice-King was driven
 42962	back to the KolochÃ¡ and could get no farther; while the divisions of
 42963	Morand and GÃ©rard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the
 42964	redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing
 42965	probably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of
 42966	the orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the
 42967	disposition it is said that, after the fight has commenced in this
 42968	manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemyâs movements,
 42969	and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be
 42970	made by Napoleon during the battle. But this was not and could not be
 42971	done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as
 42972	appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one
 42973	of his orders during the fight could be executed.
 42974	
 42975	
 42976	
 42977	
 42978	
 42979	CHAPTER XXVIII
 42980	
 42981	Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of BorodinÃ³
 42982	because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the
 42983	orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more
 42984	full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world
 42985	have been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped
 42986	by the will of one manâPeter the Greatâand that France from a republic
 42987	became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one
 42988	manâNapoleonâto say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a
 42989	bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.
 42990	
 42991	If it had depended on Napoleonâs will to fight or not to fight the
 42992	battle of BorodinÃ³, and if this or that other arrangement depended on
 42993	his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will
 42994	might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring
 42995	Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been
 42996	the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is
 42997	indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest
 42998	(without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre
 42999	of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IXâs stomach being deranged. But
 43000	to men who do not admit that Russia was formed by the will of one man,
 43001	Peter I, or that the French Empire was formed and the war with Russia
 43002	begun by the will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely
 43003	untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. To the
 43004	question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself,
 43005	namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on
 43006	highâdepends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the
 43007	events, and that a Napoleonâs influence on the course of these events is
 43008	purely external and fictitious.
 43009	
 43010	Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of
 43011	St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IXâs will, though he gave the
 43012	order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and
 43013	strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand
 43014	men at BorodinÃ³ was not due to Napoleonâs will, though he ordered the
 43015	commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done
 43016	because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human
 43017	dignityâwhich tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not less
 43018	a man than the great Napoleonâdemands the acceptance of that solution of
 43019	the question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.
 43020	
 43021	At the battle of BorodinÃ³ Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.
 43022	That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed
 43023	people.
 43024	
 43025	The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of BorodinÃ³
 43026	not because of Napoleonâs orders but by their own volition. The whole
 43027	armyâFrench, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutchâhungry, ragged, and
 43028	weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road
 43029	to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then
 43030	forbidden them to fight the Russians, they would have killed him and
 43031	have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable.
 43032	
 43033	When they heard Napoleonâs proclamation offering them, as compensation
 43034	for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been
 43035	in the battle before Moscow, they cried âVive lâEmpereur!â just as they
 43036	had cried âVive lâEmpereur!â at the sight of the portrait of the boy
 43037	piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would
 43038	have cried âVive lâEmpereur!â at any nonsense that might be told them.
 43039	There was nothing left for them to do but cry âVive lâEmpereur!â and go
 43040	to fight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it
 43041	was not because of Napoleonâs commands that they killed their fellow
 43042	men.
 43043	
 43044	And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none
 43045	of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what
 43046	was going on before him. So the way in which these people killed one
 43047	another was not decided by Napoleonâs will but occurred independently of
 43048	him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took
 43049	part in the common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took
 43050	place by his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a
 43051	cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the
 43052	transport soldiers.
 43053	
 43054	Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was
 43055	the cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former
 43056	occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as
 43057	previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleonâs cold on
 43058	the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.
 43059	
 43060	The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even
 43061	better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. His
 43062	pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but
 43063	much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse
 43064	than previous ones because the battle of BorodinÃ³ was the first Napoleon
 43065	did not win. The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders
 43066	seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks
 43067	of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the
 43068	very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people
 43069	fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a
 43070	battle that has been won.
 43071	
 43072	The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were
 43073	a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were
 43074	criticizedâcriticized for their very perfection, for their excessive
 43075	minuteness.
 43076	
 43077	Napoleon at the battle of BorodinÃ³ fulfilled his office as
 43078	representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other
 43079	battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he
 43080	inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not
 43081	contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of
 43082	battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his
 43083	role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.
 43084	
 43085	
 43086	
 43087	
 43088	
 43089	CHAPTER XXIX
 43090	
 43091	On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:
 43092	
 43093	âThe chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!â
 43094	
 43095	Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him
 43096	about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empressâ
 43097	household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details
 43098	relating to the court.
 43099	
 43100	He showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beaussetâs love of
 43101	travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who
 43102	knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron
 43103	while a patient is being strapped to the operating table. âThe matter is
 43104	in my hands and is clear and definite in my head. When the time comes to
 43105	set to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and
 43106	the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you
 43107	ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.â
 43108	
 43109	Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before
 43110	the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He
 43111	was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and
 43112	in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the
 43113	evening, he went into the large division of the tent at three oâclock in
 43114	the morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had
 43115	not withdrawn, and was told that the enemyâs fires were still in the
 43116	same places. He nodded approval.
 43117	
 43118	The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.
 43119	
 43120	âWell, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?â Napoleon
 43121	asked him.
 43122	
 43123	âWithout doubt, sire,â replied Rapp.
 43124	
 43125	Napoleon looked at him.
 43126	
 43127	âDo you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at SmolÃ©nsk?â
 43128	continued Rapp. âThe wine is drawn and must be drunk.â
 43129	
 43130	Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his
 43131	hand.
 43132	
 43133	âThis poor army!â he suddenly remarked. âIt has diminished greatly since
 43134	SmolÃ©nsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so
 43135	and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards
 43136	are intact?â he remarked interrogatively.
 43137	
 43138	âYes, sire,â replied Rapp.
 43139	
 43140	Napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch.
 43141	He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible
 43142	to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had
 43143	all been given and were now being executed.
 43144	
 43145	âHave the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the
 43146	Guards?â asked Napoleon sternly.
 43147	
 43148	âYes, sire.â
 43149	
 43150	âThe rice too?â
 43151	
 43152	Rapp replied that he had given the Emperorâs order about the rice, but
 43153	Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that
 43154	his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon
 43155	ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his
 43156	own.
 43157	
 43158	âI have neither taste nor smell,â he remarked, sniffing at his glass.
 43159	âThis cold is tiresome. They talk about medicineâwhat is the good of
 43160	medicine when it canât cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but
 43161	they donât help at all. What can doctors cure? One canât cure anything.
 43162	Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its
 43163	nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it
 43164	will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies.
 43165	Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the
 43166	watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that
 43167	blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.â
 43168	
 43169	And having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,
 43170	Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.
 43171	
 43172	âDo you know, Rapp, what military art is?â asked he. âIt is the art of
 43173	being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. Thatâs all.â
 43174	
 43175	Rapp made no reply.
 43176	
 43177	âTomorrow we shall have to deal with KutÃºzov!â said Napoleon. âWe shall
 43178	see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks
 43179	and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We shall
 43180	see!â
 43181	
 43182	He looked at his watch. It was still only four oâclock. He did not feel
 43183	sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He
 43184	rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went
 43185	out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible
 43186	moisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly
 43187	burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of the
 43188	Russian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and the
 43189	rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to take
 43190	up their positions were clearly audible.
 43191	
 43192	Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and
 43193	listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in
 43194	a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn
 43195	himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped
 43196	in front of him.
 43197	
 43198	âWhat year did you enter the service?â he asked with that affectation
 43199	of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the
 43200	soldiers.
 43201	
 43202	The man answered the question.
 43203	
 43204	âAh! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?â
 43205	
 43206	âIt has, Your Majesty.â
 43207	
 43208	Napoleon nodded and walked away.
 43209	
 43210	
 43211	At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of ShevÃ¡rdino.
 43212	
 43213	It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in
 43214	the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the
 43215	faint morning light.
 43216	
 43217	On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in
 43218	the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report
 43219	shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the
 43220	right.
 43221	
 43222	The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out
 43223	and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.
 43224	
 43225	Napoleon with his suite rode up to the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt where he
 43226	dismounted. The game had begun.
 43227	
 43228	
 43229	
 43230	
 43231	
 43232	CHAPTER XXX
 43233	
 43234	On returning to GÃ³rki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre ordered
 43235	his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning,
 43236	and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner BorÃ­s
 43237	had given up to him.
 43238	
 43239	Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left
 43240	the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was
 43241	shaking him.
 43242	
 43243	âYour excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!â he kept repeating
 43244	pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at
 43245	him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.
 43246	
 43247	âWhat? Has it begun? Is it time?â Pierre asked, waking up.
 43248	
 43249	âHear the firing,â said the groom, a discharged soldier. âAll the
 43250	gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long
 43251	ago.â
 43252	
 43253	Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright,
 43254	fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a
 43255	cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken
 43256	by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on the
 43257	dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on the
 43258	windows, the fence, and on Pierreâs horses standing before the hut. The
 43259	roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a
 43260	Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.
 43261	
 43262	âItâs time, Count; itâs time!â cried the adjutant.
 43263	
 43264	Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the
 43265	street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the
 43266	day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the
 43267	staff could be heard conversing in French, and KutÃºzovâs gray head in
 43268	a white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his
 43269	shoulders. He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before
 43270	him.
 43271	
 43272	Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him,
 43273	spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that
 43274	spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and
 43275	covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the
 43276	bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it
 43277	through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden-tinted
 43278	light and long dark shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of
 43279	the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green
 43280	color; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and
 43281	was pierced beyond ValÃºevo by the SmolÃ©nsk highroad crowded with troops.
 43282	Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses.
 43283	There were troops to be seen everywhere, in front and to the right and
 43284	left. All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed
 43285	Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself, of BorodinÃ³
 43286	and the hollows on both sides of the KolochÃ¡.
 43287	
 43288	Above the KolochÃ¡, in BorodinÃ³ and on both sides of it, especially to
 43289	the left where the VÃ³yna flowing between its marshy banks falls into
 43290	the KolochÃ¡, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to
 43291	become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored
 43292	and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist,
 43293	and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning
 43294	sun were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from
 43295	the dew, and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the
 43296	riverbanks and in BorodinÃ³. A white church could be seen through the
 43297	mist, and here and there the roofs of huts in BorodinÃ³ as well as dense
 43298	masses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And all
 43299	this moved, or seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spread out over
 43300	the whole space. Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near BorodinÃ³, so
 43301	along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods
 43302	and fields to the left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high
 43303	ground, clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of
 43304	nothing, now singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others
 43305	dense, which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over
 43306	the whole expanse.
 43307	
 43308	These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing
 43309	produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.
 43310	
 43311	âPuff!ââsuddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from
 43312	violet into gray and milky white, and âboom!â came the report a second
 43313	later.
 43314	
 43315	âPuff! puff!ââand two clouds arose pushing one another and blending
 43316	together; and âboom, boom!â came the sounds confirming what the eye had
 43317	seen.
 43318	
 43319	Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round
 43320	compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating
 43321	to one side, andââpuffâ (with a pause)ââpuff, puff!â three and then four
 43322	more appeared and then from each, with the same intervalââboomâboom,
 43323	boom!â came the fine, firm, precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if
 43324	those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods,
 43325	fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over
 43326	fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were continually appearing
 43327	followed by their solemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and
 43328	woods, there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time
 43329	to become balls, but had their little echoes in just the same way.
 43330	âTrakh-ta-ta-takh!â came the frequent crackle of musketry, but it was
 43331	irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon.
 43332	
 43333	Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that
 43334	movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at KutÃºzov and his suite,
 43335	to compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking
 43336	at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the
 43337	same feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth
 43338	of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood
 43339	after his talk with Prince Andrew.
 43340	
 43341	âGo, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!â KutÃºzov was
 43342	saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the
 43343	battlefield.
 43344	
 43345	Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down
 43346	the knoll.
 43347	
 43348	âTo the crossing!â said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one
 43349	of the staff who asked where he was going.
 43350	
 43351	âIâll go there too, I too!â thought Pierre, and followed the general.
 43352	
 43353	The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to
 43354	his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest,
 43355	clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes
 43356	pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles
 43357	were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he
 43358	galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to smile as they
 43359	watched him from the knoll.
 43360	
 43361	
 43362	
 43363	
 43364	
 43365	CHAPTER XXXI
 43366	
 43367	Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping
 43368	turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped
 43369	in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass
 43370	either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers
 43371	everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with
 43372	some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same
 43373	dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat,
 43374	who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horseâs
 43375	hoofs.
 43376	
 43377	âWhy ride into the middle of the battalion?â one of them shouted at him.
 43378	
 43379	Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,
 43380	bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse,
 43381	galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.
 43382	
 43383	There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing.
 43384	Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the
 43385	bridge across the KolochÃ¡ between GÃ³rki and BorodinÃ³, which the French
 43386	(having occupied BorodinÃ³) were attacking in the first phase of the
 43387	battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that
 43388	soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow,
 43389	among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the
 43390	smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing
 43391	going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did
 43392	not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the
 43393	projectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side
 43394	of the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded,
 43395	though many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which did
 43396	not leave his face.
 43397	
 43398	âWhyâs that fellow in front of the line?â shouted somebody at him again.
 43399	
 43400	âTo the left!... Keep to the right!â the men shouted to him.
 43401	
 43402	Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of RaÃ©vskiâs
 43403	adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently
 43404	also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.
 43405	
 43406	âHow have you got here?â he said, and galloped on.
 43407	
 43408	Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of
 43409	getting in someoneâs way again, galloped after the adjutant.
 43410	
 43411	âWhatâs happening here? May I come with you?â he asked.
 43412	
 43413	âOne moment, one moment!â replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout
 43414	colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and
 43415	then addressed Pierre.
 43416	
 43417	âWhy have you come here, Count?â he asked with a smile. âStill
 43418	inquisitive?â
 43419	
 43420	âYes, yes,â assented Pierre.
 43421	
 43422	But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.
 43423	
 43424	âHere itâs tolerable,â said he, âbut with BagratiÃ³n on the left flank
 43425	theyâre getting it frightfully hot.â
 43426	
 43427	âReally?â said Pierre. âWhere is that?â
 43428	
 43429	âCome along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in
 43430	our battery it is still bearable,â said the adjutant. âWill you come?â
 43431	
 43432	âYes, Iâll come with you,â replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.
 43433	
 43434	It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being
 43435	carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day
 43436	before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his
 43437	head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.
 43438	
 43439	âWhy havenât they carried him away?â Pierre was about to ask, but seeing
 43440	the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he
 43441	checked himself.
 43442	
 43443	Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the
 43444	adjutant to RaÃ©vskiâs Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutantâs
 43445	and jolted him at every step.
 43446	
 43447	âYou donât seem to be used to riding, Count?â remarked the adjutant.
 43448	
 43449	âNo itâs not that, but her action seems so jerky,â said Pierre in a
 43450	puzzled tone.
 43451	
 43452	âWhy... sheâs wounded!â said the adjutant. âIn the off foreleg above the
 43453	knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of
 43454	fire!â
 43455	
 43456	Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery
 43457	which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the
 43458	noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet,
 43459	with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up
 43460	the hill on foot.
 43461	
 43462	âIs the general here?â asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.
 43463	
 43464	âHe was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,â someone told him,
 43465	pointing to the right.
 43466	
 43467	The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.
 43468	
 43469	âDonât trouble about me,â said Pierre. âIâll go up onto the knoll if I
 43470	may?â
 43471	
 43472	âYes, do. Youâll see everything from there and itâs less dangerous, and
 43473	Iâll come for you.â
 43474	
 43475	Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet
 43476	again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that
 43477	day.
 43478	
 43479	The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known
 43480	to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or RaÃ©vskiâs Redoubt, and to the
 43481	French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre,
 43482	around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as
 43483	the key to the whole position.
 43484	
 43485	This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had
 43486	been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired
 43487	through openings in the earthwork.
 43488	
 43489	In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired
 43490	incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending
 43491	that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches
 43492	had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most
 43493	important point of the battle.
 43494	
 43495	On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one
 43496	of the least significant parts of the field.
 43497	
 43498	Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench
 43499	surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with
 43500	an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the
 43501	battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers
 43502	who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past
 43503	him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired
 43504	continually one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the
 43505	whole neighborhood in powder smoke.
 43506	
 43507	In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support,
 43508	here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were
 43509	separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and
 43510	as it were family feeling of animation.
 43511	
 43512	The intrusion of Pierreâs nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an
 43513	unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with
 43514	surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery
 43515	officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if
 43516	to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.
 43517	
 43518	A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just
 43519	out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns
 43520	entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.
 43521	
 43522	âSir,â he said, âpermit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be
 43523	here.â
 43524	
 43525	The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre.
 43526	But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat
 43527	was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench
 43528	with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up
 43529	and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard,
 43530	their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a
 43531	kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs,
 43532	cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the
 43533	regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him,
 43534	gave him a nickname (âour gentlemanâ), and made kindly fun of him among
 43535	themselves.
 43536	
 43537	A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around
 43538	with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.
 43539	
 43540	âAnd howâs it youâre not afraid, sir, really now?â a red-faced,
 43541	broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set
 43542	of sound, white teeth.
 43543	
 43544	âAre you afraid, then?â said Pierre.
 43545	
 43546	âWhat else do you expect?â answered the soldier. âShe has no mercy, you
 43547	know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One canât
 43548	help being afraid,â he said laughing.
 43549	
 43550	Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.
 43551	They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the
 43552	discovery that he did so delighted them.
 43553	
 43554	âItâs the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman itâs wonderful!
 43555	Thereâs a gentleman for you!â
 43556	
 43557	âTo your places!â cried the young officer to the men gathered round
 43558	Pierre.
 43559	
 43560	The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or
 43561	second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with
 43562	great precision and formality.
 43563	
 43564	The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more
 43565	intense over the whole field, especially to the left where BagratiÃ³nâs
 43566	flÃ¨ches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it
 43567	almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole
 43568	attention was engrossed by watching the family circleâseparated from all
 43569	elseâformed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of
 43570	joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield
 43571	was now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier
 43572	lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he
 43573	observed the faces of those around him.
 43574	
 43575	By ten oâclock some twenty men had already been carried away from the
 43576	battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more
 43577	frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around.
 43578	But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices
 43579	and jokes were heard on all sides.
 43580	
 43581	âA live one!â shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.
 43582	
 43583	âNot this way! To the infantry!â added another with loud laughter,
 43584	seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.
 43585	
 43586	âAre you bowing to a friend, eh?â remarked another, chaffing a peasant
 43587	who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.
 43588	
 43589	Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see
 43590	what was happening in front.
 43591	
 43592	âTheyâve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,â said they, pointing
 43593	over the earthwork.
 43594	
 43595	âMind your own business,â an old sergeant shouted at them. âIf theyâve
 43596	retired itâs because thereâs work for them to do farther back.â
 43597	
 43598	And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a
 43599	shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.
 43600	
 43601	âTo the fifth gun, wheel it up!â came shouts from one side.
 43602	
 43603	âNow then, all together, like bargees!â rose the merry voices of those
 43604	who were moving the gun.
 43605	
 43606	âOh, she nearly knocked our gentlemanâs hat off!â cried the red-faced
 43607	humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. âAwkward baggage!â he added
 43608	reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a manâs
 43609	leg.
 43610	
 43611	âNow then, you foxes!â said another, laughing at some militiamen who,
 43612	stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.
 43613	
 43614	âSo this gruel isnât to your taste? Oh, you crows! Youâre scared!â they
 43615	shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg
 43616	had been torn off.
 43617	
 43618	âThere, lads... oh, oh!â they mimicked the peasants, âthey donât like it
 43619	at all!â
 43620	
 43621	Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after
 43622	every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.
 43623	
 43624	As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and
 43625	rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to
 43626	what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and
 43627	more intense glowed in the faces of these men.
 43628	
 43629	Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know
 43630	what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire
 43631	which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the
 43632	same way in his own soul.
 43633	
 43634	At ten oâclock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of
 43635	the battery and along the KÃ¡menka streamlet retreated. From the battery
 43636	they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on
 43637	their muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and after
 43638	speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again
 43639	having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down,
 43640	so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks of
 43641	infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts
 43642	of command, and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry
 43643	moved forward.
 43644	
 43645	Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck
 43646	by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking
 43647	backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.
 43648	
 43649	The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their
 43650	long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few
 43651	minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from
 43652	that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the
 43653	battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed. Around
 43654	the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any
 43655	longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being
 43656	in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid strides from one
 43657	gun to another with a frowning face. The young officer, with his face
 43658	still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The
 43659	soldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business
 43660	with strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as
 43661	though they were on springs.
 43662	
 43663	The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which
 43664	Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the
 43665	commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to
 43666	his superior.
 43667	
 43668	âI have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are
 43669	we to continue firing?â he asked.
 43670	
 43671	âGrapeshot!â the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking
 43672	over the wall of the trench.
 43673	
 43674	Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending
 43675	double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything
 43676	became strange, confused, and misty in Pierreâs eyes.
 43677	
 43678	One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a
 43679	soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before,
 43680	now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting
 43681	âHurrah!â were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.
 43682	
 43683	A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was
 43684	standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes
 43685	and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were
 43686	entering the battery ran back.
 43687	
 43688	âAll with grapeshot!â shouted the officer.
 43689	
 43690	The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed
 43691	him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of
 43692	some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.
 43693	
 43694	âThe scoundrels! What are they doing?â shouted the officer, turning to
 43695	Pierre.
 43696	
 43697	The officerâs face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under
 43698	his frowning brow.
 43699	
 43700	âRun to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!â he yelled,
 43701	angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.
 43702	
 43703	âIâll go,â said Pierre.
 43704	
 43705	The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side.
 43706	
 43707	âDonât fire.... Wait!â he shouted.
 43708	
 43709	The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against
 43710	Pierre.
 43711	
 43712	âEh, sir, this is no place for you,â said he, and ran down the slope.
 43713	
 43714	Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was
 43715	sitting.
 43716	
 43717	One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front,
 43718	beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. âWhere am I going?â
 43719	he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition
 43720	wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on.
 43721	Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the
 43722	same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a
 43723	deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.
 43724	
 43725	When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his
 43726	hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed,
 43727	only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a
 43728	horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while
 43729	another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and
 43730	piercing cries.
 43731	
 43732	
 43733	
 43734	
 43735	
 43736	CHAPTER XXXII
 43737	
 43738	Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery,
 43739	as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.
 43740	
 43741	On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something
 43742	there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no
 43743	time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior officer lying on
 43744	the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something
 43745	down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was
 43746	struggling forward shouting âBrothers!â and trying to free himself from
 43747	some men who were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else
 43748	that was strange.
 43749	
 43750	But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that
 43751	the soldier shouting âBrothers!â was a prisoner, and that another man
 43752	had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run
 43753	into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue
 43754	uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively
 43755	guarding against the shockâfor they had been running together at full
 43756	speed before they saw one anotherâPierre put out his hands and seized
 43757	the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the
 43758	throat with the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by
 43759	his collar.
 43760	
 43761	For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one anotherâs
 43762	unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and
 43763	what they were to do next. âAm I taken prisoner or have I taken him
 43764	prisoner?â each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more
 43765	inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierreâs strong
 43766	hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and
 43767	tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their
 43768	heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre
 43769	that the French officerâs head had been torn off, so swiftly had he
 43770	ducked it.
 43771	
 43772	Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought
 43773	as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery
 43774	and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who,
 43775	it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he reached the foot
 43776	of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who,
 43777	stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward
 43778	the battery. (This was the attack for which ErmÃ³lov claimed the credit,
 43779	declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible:
 43780	it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. Georgeâs
 43781	Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to
 43782	take who got there.)
 43783	
 43784	The French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting
 43785	âHurrah!â pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult
 43786	to call them back.
 43787	
 43788	The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was
 43789	a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of
 43790	woundedâsome known to Pierre and some unknownâRussians and French,
 43791	with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on
 43792	stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where
 43793	he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle which had received
 43794	him as a member he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom
 43795	he did not know, but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in
 43796	the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth
 43797	wall. The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him
 43798	away.
 43799	
 43800	Pierre ran down the slope once more.
 43801	
 43802	âNow they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have
 43803	done!â he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers
 43804	moving from the battlefield.
 43805	
 43806	But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and
 43807	especially to the left, near SemÃ«novsk, something seemed to be seething
 43808	in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but
 43809	even increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks
 43810	with all his remaining strength.
 43811	
 43812	
 43813	
 43814	
 43815	
 43816	CHAPTER XXXIII
 43817	
 43818	The chief action of the battle of BorodinÃ³ was fought within the seven
 43819	thousand feet between BorodinÃ³ and BagratiÃ³nâs flÃ¨ches. Beyond that
 43820	space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians
 43821	with UvÃ¡rovâs cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond UtÃ­tsa,
 43822	Poniatowskiâs collision with TÃºchkov; but these two were detached and
 43823	feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the
 43824	battlefield. On the field between BorodinÃ³ and the flÃ¨ches, beside the
 43825	wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible
 43826	from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.
 43827	
 43828	The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred
 43829	guns.
 43830	
 43831	Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,
 43832	Campanâs and Dessaixâs, advanced from the French right, while Muratâs
 43833	troops advanced on BorodinÃ³ from their left.
 43834	
 43835	From the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the flÃ¨ches were
 43836	two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies
 43837	to BorodinÃ³, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there,
 43838	especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality.
 43839	The soldiers of Dessaixâs division advancing against the flÃ¨ches could
 43840	only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and
 43841	the flÃ¨ches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke
 43842	of the guns and musketry on the flÃ¨ches grew so dense that it covered
 43843	the whole approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could
 43844	be caught of something blackâprobably menâand at times the glint of
 43845	bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were
 43846	French or Russian, could not be discovered from the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt.
 43847	
 43848	The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into
 43849	Napoleonâs face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the
 43850	flÃ¨ches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if
 43851	the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts
 43852	were heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was
 43853	being done there.
 43854	
 43855	Napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in
 43856	its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes
 43857	Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell
 43858	where what he had seen was.
 43859	
 43860	He descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.
 43861	
 43862	Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at
 43863	the battlefield.
 43864	
 43865	But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where
 43866	he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some of his
 43867	generals had taken their stand, but even from the flÃ¨ches themselvesâin
 43868	which by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers,
 43869	alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or
 43870	maddenedâeven at those flÃ¨ches themselves it was impossible to make out
 43871	what was taking place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and
 43872	musketry fire, now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now
 43873	infantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not
 43874	knowing what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.
 43875	
 43876	From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his
 43877	marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress
 43878	of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was
 43879	impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given
 43880	moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place
 43881	of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also
 43882	because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon
 43883	circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming
 43884	false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that
 43885	BorodinÃ³ had been occupied and the bridge over the KolochÃ¡ was in the
 43886	hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the
 43887	troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up
 43888	on the farther side and wait. But before that order was givenâalmost
 43889	as soon in fact as the adjutant had left BorodinÃ³âthe bridge had been
 43890	retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre
 43891	had been present at the beginning of the battle.
 43892	
 43893	An adjutant galloped up from the flÃ¨ches with a pale and frightened face
 43894	and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan
 43895	wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been
 43896	told that the French had been repulsed, the flÃ¨ches had in fact been
 43897	recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive and only
 43898	slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy
 43899	reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before
 43900	he gave them or could not be and were not executed.
 43901	
 43902	The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle
 43903	but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only
 43904	occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements
 43905	without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to
 43906	fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even
 43907	their orders, like Napoleonâs, were seldom carried out, and then but
 43908	partially. For the most part things happened contrary to their orders.
 43909	Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers
 43910	ordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians
 43911	unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward,
 43912	and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians.
 43913	In this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the SemÃ«novsk hollow
 43914	and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and
 43915	galloped full speed back again. The infantry moved in the same way,
 43916	sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to
 43917	go to. All orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send
 43918	infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantryâall
 43919	such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the
 43920	units concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less
 43921	Napoleon. They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling
 43922	orders or for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at
 43923	stake is what is dearest to manâhis own lifeâand it sometimes seems that
 43924	safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men
 43925	who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood
 43926	of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward and
 43927	backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops. All
 43928	their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the harm of
 43929	disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over
 43930	the fields on which these men were floundering about. As soon as they
 43931	left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their
 43932	superiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them
 43933	under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them
 43934	back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death
 43935	they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance
 43936	promptings of the throng.
 43937	
 43938	
 43939	
 43940	
 43941	
 43942	CHAPTER XXXIV
 43943	
 43944	Napoleonâs generalsâDavout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that region of
 43945	fire and sometimes even entered itârepeatedly led into it huge masses of
 43946	well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always happened in their
 43947	former battles, instead of the news they expected of the enemyâs flight,
 43948	these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs.
 43949	The generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased.
 43950	In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand
 43951	reinforcements.
 43952	
 43953	Napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Muratâs
 43954	adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed
 43955	if His Majesty would let him have another division.
 43956	
 43957	âReinforcements?â said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at
 43958	the adjutantâa handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Muratâs
 43959	ownâas though he did not understand his words.
 43960	
 43961	âReinforcements!â thought Napoleon to himself. âHow can they need
 43962	reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a
 43963	weak, unentrenched Russian wing?â
 43964	
 43965	âTell the King of Naples,â said he sternly, âthat it is not noon yet,
 43966	and I donât yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...â
 43967	
 43968	The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without
 43969	removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being
 43970	slaughtered.
 43971	
 43972	Napoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began
 43973	talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.
 43974	
 43975	In the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest
 43976	Napoleon, Berthierâs eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who
 43977	was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard.
 43978	Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in
 43979	a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending
 43980	reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the
 43981	Emperor would give another division.
 43982	
 43983	Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
 43984	without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the
 43985	generals of the suite around him.
 43986	
 43987	âYou are very fiery, Belliard,â said Napoleon, when he again came up to
 43988	the general. âIn the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. Go
 43989	and have another look and then come back to me.â
 43990	
 43991	Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the
 43992	battlefield galloped up.
 43993	
 43994	âNow then, what do you want?â asked Napoleon in the tone of a man
 43995	irritated at being continually disturbed.
 43996	
 43997	âSire, the prince...â began the adjutant.
 43998	
 43999	âAsks for reinforcements?â said Napoleon with an angry gesture.
 44000	
 44001	The adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the
 44002	Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and
 44003	called Berthier.
 44004	
 44005	âWe must give reserves,â he said, moving his arms slightly apart.
 44006	âWho do you think should be sent there?â he asked of Berthier (whom he
 44007	subsequently termed âthat gosling I have made an eagleâ).
 44008	
 44009	âSend ClaparÃ¨deâs division, sire,â replied Berthier, who knew all the
 44010	divisionâs regiments, and battalions by heart.
 44011	
 44012	Napoleon nodded assent.
 44013	
 44014	The adjutant galloped to ClaparÃ¨deâs division and a few minutes later
 44015	the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. Napoleon
 44016	gazed silently in that direction.
 44017	
 44018	âNo!â he suddenly said to Berthier. âI canât send ClaparÃ¨de. Send
 44019	Friantâs division.â
 44020	
 44021	Though there was no advantage in sending Friantâs division instead of
 44022	ClaparÃ¨deâs, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping
 44023	ClaparÃ¨de and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly.
 44024	Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing
 44025	the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicinesâa role he so justly
 44026	understood and condemned.
 44027	
 44028	Friantâs division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke
 44029	of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a
 44030	gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all asked
 44031	for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their
 44032	positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was
 44033	melting away.
 44034	
 44035	Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.
 44036	
 44037	M. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning,
 44038	came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His
 44039	Majesty.
 44040	
 44041	âI hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?â said he.
 44042	
 44043	Napoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the negation to
 44044	refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beausset ventured
 44045	with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not
 44046	having lunch when one can get it.
 44047	
 44048	âGo away...â exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.
 44049	
 44050	A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. de
 44051	Beaussetâs face and he glided away to the other generals.
 44052	
 44053	Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an
 44054	ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always
 44055	winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the
 44056	game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he
 44057	loses.
 44058	
 44059	His troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations
 44060	had been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamation courte
 44061	et Ã©nergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that
 44062	he was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the
 44063	enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedlandâyet the terrible
 44064	stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent.
 44065	
 44066	All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the
 44067	concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break
 44068	the enemyâs line, and a cavalry attack by âthe men of iron,â all these
 44069	methods had already been employed, yet not only was there no victory,
 44070	but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded,
 44071	of reinforcements needed, of the impossibility of driving back the
 44072	Russians, and of disorganization among his own troops.
 44073	
 44074	Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a
 44075	few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with
 44076	congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the
 44077	corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and
 44078	stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather
 44079	in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena,
 44080	Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was happening
 44081	to his troops.
 44082	
 44083	Despite news of the capture of the flÃ¨ches, Napoleon saw that this was
 44084	not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former
 44085	battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about
 44086	him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and
 44087	they all shunned one anotherâs eyesâonly a de Beausset could fail to
 44088	grasp the meaning of what was happening.
 44089	
 44090	But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of
 44091	a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all
 44092	efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that
 44093	the least accident might nowâwith the fight balanced on such a strained
 44094	centerâdestroy him and his army.
 44095	
 44096	When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in
 44097	which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon,
 44098	or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the
 44099	concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the
 44100	Russians still holding their groundâa terrible feeling like a nightmare
 44101	took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy
 44102	him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing,
 44103	might break through his center, he himself might be killed by a stray
 44104	cannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only
 44105	considered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky
 44106	chances presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like
 44107	a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him,
 44108	and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows
 44109	should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and
 44110	limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in
 44111	his helplessness.
 44112	
 44113	The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French
 44114	army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool
 44115	below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier
 44116	approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to
 44117	ascertain the position of affairs.
 44118	
 44119	âWhat? What do you say?â asked Napoleon. âYes, tell them to bring me my
 44120	horse.â
 44121	
 44122	He mounted and rode toward SemÃ«novsk.
 44123	
 44124	Amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through
 44125	which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly
 44126	or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before
 44127	seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of
 44128	guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave
 44129	a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux
 44130	vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at SemÃ«novsk, and through the
 44131	smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They
 44132	were Russians.
 44133	
 44134	The Russians stood in serried ranks behind SemÃ«novsk village and its
 44135	knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent
 44136	forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous
 44137	slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the
 44138	Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie
 44139	from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what was going on
 44140	before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to
 44141	depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first
 44142	time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.
 44143	
 44144	One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead
 44145	the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon,
 44146	exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this generalâs senseless
 44147	offer.
 44148	
 44149	Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.
 44150	
 44151	âAt eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard
 44152	destroyed!â he said, and turning his horse rode back to ShevÃ¡rdino.
 44153	
 44154	
 44155	
 44156	
 44157	
 44158	CHAPTER XXXV
 44159	
 44160	On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat
 44161	KutÃºzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no
 44162	orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.
 44163	
 44164	âYes, yes, do that,â he replied to various proposals. âYes, yes: go,
 44165	dear boy, and have a look,â he would say to one or another of those
 44166	about him; or, âNo, donât, weâd better wait!â He listened to the reports
 44167	that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded
 44168	that of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he
 44169	were not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in
 44170	something elseâin the expression of face and tone of voice of those who
 44171	were reporting. By long years of military experience he knew, and with
 44172	the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to
 44173	direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he
 44174	knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a
 44175	commander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by
 44176	the number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force
 44177	called the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it
 44178	in as far as that was in his power.
 44179	
 44180	KutÃºzovâs general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention,
 44181	and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master
 44182	the fatigue of his old and feeble body.
 44183	
 44184	At eleven oâclock they brought him news that the flÃ¨ches captured by the
 44185	French had been retaken, but that Prince BagratiÃ³n was wounded. KutÃºzov
 44186	groaned and swayed his head.
 44187	
 44188	âRide over to Prince Peter IvÃ¡novich and find out about it exactly,â he
 44189	said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg
 44190	who was standing behind him.
 44191	
 44192	âWill Your Highness please take command of the first army?â
 44193	
 44194	Soon after the dukeâs departureâbefore he could possibly have reached
 44195	SemÃ«novskâhis adjutant came back from him and told KutÃºzov that the duke
 44196	asked for more troops.
 44197	
 44198	KutÃºzov made a grimace and sent an order to DokhtÃºrov to take over the
 44199	command of the first army, and a request to the dukeâwhom he said he
 44200	could not spare at such an important momentâto return to him. When
 44201	they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff
 44202	officers congratulated him, KutÃºzov smiled.
 44203	
 44204	âWait a little, gentlemen,â said he. âThe battle is won, and there is
 44205	nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to
 44206	wait before we rejoice.â
 44207	
 44208	But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.
 44209	
 44210	When ScherbÃ­nin came galloping from the left flank with news that the
 44211	French had captured the flÃ¨ches and the village of SemÃ«novsk, KutÃºzov,
 44212	guessing by the sounds of the battle and by ScherbÃ­ninâs looks that the
 44213	news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking ScherbÃ­ninâs
 44214	arm, led him aside.
 44215	
 44216	âGo, my dear fellow,â he said to ErmÃ³lov, âand see whether something
 44217	canât be done.â
 44218	
 44219	KutÃºzov was in GÃ³rki, near the center of the Russian position. The
 44220	attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several
 44221	times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond BorodinÃ³,
 44222	and on their left flank UvÃ¡rovâs cavalry had put the French to flight.
 44223	
 44224	Toward three oâclock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all
 44225	who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him,
 44226	KutÃºzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with
 44227	the dayâs successâa success exceeding his expectations, but the old
 44228	manâs strength was failing him. Several times his head dropped low as if
 44229	it were falling and he dozed off. Dinner was brought him.
 44230	
 44231	Adjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince Andrew
 44232	had said, âthe war should be extended widely,â and whom BagratiÃ³n so
 44233	detested, rode up while KutÃºzov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from
 44234	Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank.
 44235	The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running
 44236	back and the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances,
 44237	concluded that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the
 44238	commander in chief with that news.
 44239	
 44240	KutÃºzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced
 44241	at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.
 44242	
 44243	Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached KutÃºzov with a
 44244	half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his
 44245	cap.
 44246	
 44247	He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance
 44248	intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to
 44249	Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom
 44250	he was dealing with. âDer alte Herrâ (as in their own set the Germans
 44251	called KutÃºzov) âis making himself very comfortable,â thought Wolzogen,
 44252	and looking severely at the dishes in front of KutÃºzov he began to
 44253	report to âthe old gentlemanâ the position of affairs on the left flank
 44254	as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood
 44255	it.
 44256	
 44257	âAll the points of our position are in the enemyâs hands and we cannot
 44258	dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away and it is
 44259	impossible to stop them,â he reported.
 44260	
 44261	KutÃºzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as
 44262	if not understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing âthe old
 44263	gentlemanâsâ agitation, said with a smile:
 44264	
 44265	âI have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness
 44266	what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder....â
 44267	
 44268	âYou have seen? You have seen?...â KutÃºzov shouted. Frowning and rising
 44269	quickly, he went up to Wolzogen.
 44270	
 44271	âHow... how dare you!...â he shouted, choking and making a threatening
 44272	gesture with his trembling arms: âHow dare you, sir, say that to me? You
 44273	know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information
 44274	is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to
 44275	me, the commander in chief, than to him.â
 44276	
 44277	Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but KutÃºzov interrupted him.
 44278	
 44279	âThe enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right
 44280	flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what
 44281	you donât know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform
 44282	him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,â said KutÃºzov
 44283	sternly.
 44284	
 44285	All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of
 44286	the panting old general.
 44287	
 44288	âThey are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army!
 44289	The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred
 44290	soil of Russia,â said KutÃºzov crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed
 44291	as his eyes filled with tears.
 44292	
 44293	Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently
 44294	aside, marveling at âthe old gentlemanâsâ conceited stupidity.
 44295	
 44296	âAh, here he is, my hero!â said KutÃºzov to a portly, handsome,
 44297	dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.
 44298	
 44299	This was RaÃ©vski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part
 44300	of the field of BorodinÃ³.
 44301	
 44302	RaÃ©vski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and
 44303	that the French no longer ventured to attack.
 44304	
 44305	After hearing him, KutÃºzov said in French:
 44306	
 44307	âThen you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?â
 44308	
 44309	âOn the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is always
 44310	the most stubborn who remain victors,â replied RaÃ©vski, âand in my
 44311	opinion...â
 44312	
 44313	âKaysÃ¡rov!â KutÃºzov called to his adjutant. âSit down and write out
 44314	the order of the day for tomorrow. And you,â he continued, addressing
 44315	another, âride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.â
 44316	
 44317	While KutÃºzov was talking to RaÃ©vski and dictating the order of the day,
 44318	Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to
 44319	have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given.
 44320	
 44321	KutÃºzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to
 44322	be written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal
 44323	responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.
 44324	
 44325	And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains
 44326	throughout an army one and the same temper, known as âthe spirit of
 44327	the army,â and which constitutes the sinew of war, KutÃºzovâs words, his
 44328	order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of
 44329	the army to the other.
 44330	
 44331	It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the
 44332	farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at
 44333	different ends of the army did not even resemble what KutÃºzov had said,
 44334	but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was
 44335	not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in
 44336	the commander in chiefâs soul as in that of every Russian.
 44337	
 44338	And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing
 44339	from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe,
 44340	the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.

 44346	CHAPTER XXXVI
 44347	
 44348	Prince Andrewâs regiment was among the reserves which till after one
 44349	oâclock were stationed inactive behind SemÃ«novsk, under heavy artillery
 44350	fire. Toward two oâclock the regiment, having already lost more than
 44351	two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap
 44352	between SemÃ«novsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished
 44353	that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred
 44354	enemy guns was directed between one and two oâclock.
 44355	
 44356	Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here
 44357	lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the
 44358	right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious
 44359	domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing
 44360	cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as
 44361	if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which
 44362	the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men
 44363	were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually
 44364	being dragged away and the wounded carried off.
 44365	
 44366	With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not
 44367	yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred
 44368	paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same
 44369	mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the
 44370	ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful
 44371	shot and the cry of âstretchers!â was heard. Most of the time, by their
 44372	officersâ order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his
 44373	shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight
 44374	again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished
 44375	his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his
 44376	bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put
 44377	his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed
 44378	ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed
 44379	fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when
 44380	rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great
 44381	masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any
 44382	attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or
 44383	some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval
 44384	were heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by
 44385	occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was
 44386	as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,
 44387	commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of
 44388	the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace.
 44389	âHey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! Sheâll fall.... Ah,
 44390	they donât see it!â came identical shouts from the ranks all along the
 44391	regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown
 44392	dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner
 44393	in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell
 44394	close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted
 44395	aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But
 44396	such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had
 44397	been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale
 44398	and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.
 44399	
 44400	Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up
 44401	and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the
 44402	meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back.
 44403	There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything
 44404	went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded
 44405	carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the
 44406	rear they returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew,
 44407	considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them
 44408	an example, walked about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced
 44409	that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach
 44410	them. All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were
 44411	unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their
 44412	situation. He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the
 44413	grass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big
 44414	strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the
 44415	mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk
 44416	from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers
 44417	from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his
 44418	palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained
 44419	of the previous dayâs thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with
 44420	weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle
 44421	of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the
 44422	tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and
 44423	waited. âHere it comes... this one is coming our way again!â he thought,
 44424	listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. âOne,
 44425	another! Again! It has hit....â He stopped and looked at the ranks. âNo,
 44426	it has gone over. But this one has hit!â And again he started trying
 44427	to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five
 44428	paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A
 44429	chill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many
 44430	had been hitâa large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.
 44431	
 44432	âAdjutant!â he shouted. âOrder them not to crowd together.â
 44433	
 44434	The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.
 44435	From the other side a battalion commander rode up.
 44436	
 44437	âLook out!â came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird
 44438	whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped
 44439	with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the
 44440	battalion commanderâs horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it
 44441	was right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the
 44442	major, and galloped aside. The horseâs terror infected the men.
 44443	
 44444	âLie down!â cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.
 44445	
 44446	Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him
 44447	and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and
 44448	the meadow.
 44449	
 44450	âCan this be death?â thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new,
 44451	envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke
 44452	that curled up from the rotating black ball. âI cannot, I do not wish to
 44453	die. I love lifeâI love this grass, this earth, this air....â He thought
 44454	this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.
 44455	
 44456	âItâs shameful, sir!â he said to the adjutant. âWhat...â
 44457	
 44458	He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of
 44459	an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame,
 44460	a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side,
 44461	raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran up to him.
 44462	From the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large
 44463	stain on the grass.
 44464	
 44465	The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the
 44466	officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,
 44467	breathing heavily and noisily.
 44468	
 44469	âWhat are you waiting for? Come along!â
 44470	
 44471	The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but he
 44472	moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.
 44473	
 44474	âPick him up, lift him, itâs all the same!â cried someone.
 44475	
 44476	They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.
 44477	
 44478	âAh, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My
 44479	God!ââvoices among the officers were heard saying.
 44480	
 44481	âIt flew a hairâs breadth past my ear,â said the adjutant.
 44482	
 44483	The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started
 44484	hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.
 44485	
 44486	âKeep in step! Ah... those peasants!â shouted an officer, seizing by
 44487	their shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly and
 44488	jolting the stretcher.
 44489	
 44490	âGet into step, FÃ«dor... I say, FÃ«dor!â said the foremost peasant.
 44491	
 44492	âNow thatâs right!â said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into
 44493	step.
 44494	
 44495	âYour excellency! Eh, Prince!â said the trembling voice of TimÃ³khin, who
 44496	had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.
 44497	
 44498	Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the
 44499	stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids
 44500	drooped.
 44501	
 44502	
 44503	The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the
 44504	wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of
 44505	three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood.
 44506	In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating
 44507	oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the
 44508	grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch
 44509	trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres,
 44510	bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded
 44511	stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive
 44512	faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the
 44513	spot. Disregarding the officersâ orders, the soldiers stood leaning
 44514	against their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend
 44515	the difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the
 44516	tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans. Occasionally
 44517	dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were to be
 44518	brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents
 44519	groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka. Some were
 44520	delirious. Prince Andrewâs bearers, stepping over the wounded who had
 44521	not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up to
 44522	one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew
 44523	opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going
 44524	on around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the
 44525	whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life.
 44526	Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and
 44527	attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired
 44528	noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the
 44529	head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a
 44530	crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.
 44531	
 44532	âWe kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed
 44533	the King himself!â cried he, looking around him with eyes that glittered
 44534	with fever. âIf only reserves had come up just then, lads, there
 44535	wouldnât have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely....â
 44536	
 44537	Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with
 44538	shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. âBut isnât it all the
 44539	same now?â thought he. âAnd what will be there, and what has there been
 44540	here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in
 44541	this life I did not and do not understand.â
 44542	
 44543	
 44544	
 44545	
 44546	
 44547	CHAPTER XXXVII
 44548	
 44549	One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron,
 44550	holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small
 44551	bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked
 44552	about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a
 44553	little respite. After turning his head from right to left for some time,
 44554	he sighed and looked down.
 44555	
 44556	âAll right, immediately,â he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince
 44557	Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.
 44558	
 44559	Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.
 44560	
 44561	âIt seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a
 44562	chance!â remarked one.
 44563	
 44564	Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been
 44565	cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not
 44566	make out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all
 44567	sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted
 44568	him. All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked,
 44569	bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as
 44570	a few weeks previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled
 44571	the dirty pond beside the SmolÃ©nsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh,
 44572	the same chair Ã  canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with
 44573	horror, as by a presentiment.
 44574	
 44575	There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and
 44576	on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left
 44577	alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two
 44578	tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by
 44579	the uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and
 44580	a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.
 44581	
 44582	âOoh, ooh, ooh!â grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy
 44583	snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth,
 44584	he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing,
 44585	and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were
 44586	crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.
 44587	His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely
 44588	familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest
 44589	to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all
 44590	the time with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking
 44591	convulsively. Two doctorsâone of whom was pale and tremblingâwere
 44592	silently doing something to this manâs other, gory leg. When he had
 44593	finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the
 44594	spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.
 44595	
 44596	He glanced at Prince Andrewâs face and quickly turned away.
 44597	
 44598	âUndress him! What are you waiting for?â he cried angrily to the
 44599	dressers.
 44600	
 44601	His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince
 44602	Andrewâs mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to
 44603	undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent
 44604	down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to
 44605	someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to
 44606	lose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of
 44607	his thighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the
 44608	wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince
 44609	Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the
 44610	lips, and hurried away.
 44611	
 44612	After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a
 44613	blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the
 44614	best and happiest moments of his lifeâespecially his earliest childhood,
 44615	when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning over him
 44616	his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the pillow,
 44617	felt happy in the mere consciousness of lifeâreturned to his memory, not
 44618	merely as something past but as something present.
 44619	
 44620	The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose
 44621	head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and
 44622	trying to quiet him.
 44623	
 44624	âShow it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!â his frightened moans could
 44625	be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.
 44626	
 44627	Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because he
 44628	was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life,
 44629	or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or
 44630	because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him
 44631	was groaning so piteouslyâhe felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and
 44632	almost happy tears.
 44633	
 44634	The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood
 44635	and with the boot still on.
 44636	
 44637	âOh! Oh, ooh!â he sobbed, like a woman.
 44638	
 44639	The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew
 44640	from seeing his face, moved away.
 44641	
 44642	âMy God! What is this? Why is he here?â said Prince Andrew to himself.
 44643	
 44644	In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been
 44645	amputated, he recognized Anatole KurÃ¡gin. Men were supporting him in
 44646	their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen
 44647	lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. âYes, it is
 44648	he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,â
 44649	thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him.
 44650	âWhat is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?â he
 44651	asked himself without finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected
 44652	memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to
 44653	him. He remembered NatÃ¡sha as he had seen her for the first time at the
 44654	ball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy
 44655	face ready for rapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger
 44656	and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. He now remembered the
 44657	connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly
 44658	gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered
 44659	everything, and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy
 44660	heart.
 44661	
 44662	Prince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving
 44663	tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.
 44664	
 44665	âCompassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those
 44666	who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on
 44667	earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understandâthat is
 44668	what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me had I
 44669	lived. But now it is too late. I know it!â
 44670	
 44671	
 44672	
 44673	
 44674	
 44675	CHAPTER XXXVIII
 44676	
 44677	The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,
 44678	together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty
 44679	generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the
 44680	consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an
 44681	unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the
 44682	killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of
 44683	mind. This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame
 44684	that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his
 44685	greatness. He rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the
 44686	ShevÃ¡rdino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, his sallow face
 44687	swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse,
 44688	involuntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sounds of firing.
 44689	With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he
 44690	regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest.
 44691	A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the
 44692	artificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own
 44693	person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield.
 44694	The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility
 44695	of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not desire
 44696	Moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more glory?). The
 44697	one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he
 44698	had been on the SemÃ«novsk heights the artillery commander had proposed
 44699	to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to
 44700	strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of KnyazkÃ³vo.
 44701	Napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought
 44702	to him of the effect those batteries produced.
 44703	
 44704	An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns
 44705	had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they
 44706	still held their ground.
 44707	
 44708	âOur fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,â said the
 44709	adjutant.
 44710	
 44711	âThey want more!...â said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.
 44712	
 44713	âSire?â asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.
 44714	
 44715	âThey want more!â croaked Napoleon frowning. âLet them have it!â
 44716	
 44717	Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for
 44718	which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him,
 44719	was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary
 44720	greatness, and againâas a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing
 44721	something for itselfâhe submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy,
 44722	and inhuman role predestined for him.
 44723	
 44724	And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience
 44725	darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening
 44726	lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end
 44727	of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the
 44728	significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and
 44729	truth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to
 44730	grasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as they
 44731	were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and
 44732	all humanity.
 44733	
 44734	Not only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men
 44735	killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he
 44736	looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and,
 44737	deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that
 44738	there were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone
 44739	did he write in a letter to Paris that âthe battle field was superb,â
 44740	because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the island of St.
 44741	Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his
 44742	leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote:
 44743	
 44744	The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times:
 44745	it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and
 44746	security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.
 44747	
 44748	It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the
 44749	beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out,
 44750	full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system was
 44751	already founded; all that remained was to organize it.
 44752	
 44753	Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I
 44754	too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were
 44755	stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have
 44756	discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account to
 44757	the peoples as clerk to master.
 44758	
 44759	Europe would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people, and
 44760	anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the
 44761	common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable
 44762	rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all, and that
 44763	the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards
 44764	for the sovereigns.
 44765	
 44766	On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent,
 44767	peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed
 44768	her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all
 44769	aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated my son in the
 44770	Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and his constitutional
 44771	reign would have begun.
 44772	
 44773	Paris would have been the capital of the world, and the French the envy
 44774	of the nations!
 44775	
 44776	My leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company
 44777	with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to
 44778	leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple,
 44779	every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs,
 44780	and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and
 44781	everywhere.
 44782	
 44783	Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner
 44784	of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the
 44785	peoplesâ welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by
 44786	the employment of power confer benefactions.
 44787	
 44788	âOf four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,â he wrote further
 44789	of the Russian war, âhalf were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,
 44790	Bavarians, WÃ¼rttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and
 44791	Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third
 44792	composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine,
 44793	Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the
 44794	Thirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it
 44795	included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French. The
 44796	Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men;
 44797	the Russian army in its retreat from VÃ­lna to Moscow lost in the various
 44798	battles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow
 44799	cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want
 44800	in the woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder the Russian
 44801	army also suffered from the severity of the season; so that by the time
 44802	it reached VÃ­lna it numbered only fifty thousand, and at KÃ¡lisch less
 44803	than eighteen thousand.â
 44804	
 44805	He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the
 44806	horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the
 44807	whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found
 44808	justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who
 44809	perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.
 44810	
 44811	
 44812	
 44813	
 44814	
 44815	CHAPTER XXXIX
 44816	
 44817	Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and
 44818	various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the DavÃ½dov
 44819	family and to the crown serfsâthose fields and meadows where for
 44820	hundreds of years the peasants of BorodinÃ³, GÃ³rki, ShevÃ¡rdino, and
 44821	SemÃ«novsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the
 44822	dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space
 44823	of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and
 44824	unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves back to MozhÃ¡ysk
 44825	from the one army and back to ValÃºevo from the other. Other crowds,
 44826	exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their officers. Others held
 44827	their ground and continued to fire.
 44828	
 44829	Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of
 44830	bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a
 44831	mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood.
 44832	Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded,
 44833	on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: âEnough,
 44834	men! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?â
 44835	
 44836	To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest,
 44837	it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to
 44838	slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the
 44839	question arose in every soul: âFor what, for whom, must I kill and be
 44840	killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I donât want to do
 44841	so any more!â By evening this thought had ripened in every soul. At any
 44842	moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were
 44843	doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere.
 44844	
 44845	But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of
 44846	what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off,
 44847	some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and
 44848	they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match,
 44849	though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though
 44850	they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood
 44851	and powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both
 44852	sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done
 44853	by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds
 44854	continued.
 44855	
 44856	Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have
 44857	said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would
 44858	disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have
 44859	said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the
 44860	French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made
 44861	that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out.
 44862	
 44863	The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking
 44864	the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the
 44865	way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the
 44866	beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French
 44867	from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all
 44868	the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian
 44869	army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their
 44870	positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army.
 44871	
 44872	The French, with the memory of all their former victories during
 44873	fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleonâs invincibility, with the
 44874	consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had
 44875	lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact,
 44876	twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French
 44877	who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position
 44878	ought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to
 44879	block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been
 44880	attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain. But the French
 44881	did not make that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only
 44882	have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have
 44883	been won. To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his
 44884	Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. It
 44885	could not be. Napoleon did not give his Guards, not because he did not
 44886	want to, but because it could not be done. All the generals, officers,
 44887	and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done, because the
 44888	flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.
 44889	
 44890	It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling
 44891	of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and
 44892	soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,
 44893	after all their experience of previous battlesâwhen after one tenth of
 44894	such efforts the enemy had fledâexperienced a similar feeling of terror
 44895	before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly
 44896	at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the
 44897	attacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is
 44898	defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called
 44899	standards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were
 44900	standing, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral
 44901	superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the
 44902	Russians at BorodinÃ³. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal
 44903	that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were
 44904	perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker
 44905	by one half, could help swerving. By impetus gained, the French army was
 44906	still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort
 44907	on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal
 44908	wound it had received at BorodinÃ³. The direct consequence of the battle
 44909	of BorodinÃ³ was Napoleonâs senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat
 44910	along the old SmolÃ©nsk road, the destruction of the invading army of
 44911	five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on
 44912	which at BorodinÃ³ for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger
 44913	spirit had been laid.

 44925	CHAPTER I
 44926	
 44927	Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind.
 44928	Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he
 44929	examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the
 44930	same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary
 44931	division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a
 44932	well-known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that
 44933	Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite
 44934	of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By
 44935	the time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the
 44936	tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead
 44937	of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered
 44938	another one hundredth, and so on forever. This problem seemed to
 44939	the ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that Achilles could never
 44940	overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily
 44941	divided into discontinuous elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles
 44942	and of the tortoise was continuous.
 44943	
 44944	By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a
 44945	solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we have admitted
 44946	the conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical
 44947	progression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of
 44948	this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.
 44949	
 44950	A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with
 44951	the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex
 44952	problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.
 44953	
 44954	This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing
 44955	with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small,
 44956	and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity)
 44957	and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot
 44958	avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of
 44959	examining continuous motion.
 44960	
 44961	In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens.
 44962	The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary
 44963	human wills, is continuous.
 44964	
 44965	To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of
 44966	history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all
 44967	those human wills, manâs mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected
 44968	units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected
 44969	series of continuous events and examine it apart from others, though
 44970	there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event always
 44971	flows uninterruptedly from another.
 44972	
 44973	The second method is to consider the actions of some one manâa king or a
 44974	commanderâas equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas the
 44975	sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single
 44976	historic personage.
 44977	
 44978	Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually
 44979	takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the
 44980	units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others,
 44981	or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of
 44982	many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is
 44983	in itself false.
 44984	
 44985	It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions
 44986	drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some larger or
 44987	smaller unit as the subject of observationâas criticism has every
 44988	right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be
 44989	arbitrarily selected.
 44990	
 44991	Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the
 44992	differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and
 44993	attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of
 44994	these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.
 44995	
 44996	The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an
 44997	extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave their customary
 44998	pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and
 44999	slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some
 45000	years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive
 45001	movement which first increases and then slackens. What was the cause of
 45002	this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.
 45003	
 45004	The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and
 45005	doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling
 45006	these sayings and doings âthe Revolutionâ; then they give a detailed
 45007	biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him;
 45008	tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that
 45009	is why this movement took place and those are its laws.
 45010	
 45011	But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, but
 45012	plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, because in
 45013	it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. The sum of
 45014	human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and only the sum of
 45015	those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.
 45016	
 45017	âBut every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors;
 45018	every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been
 45019	great men,â says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time
 45020	conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the
 45021	conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of
 45022	a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my
 45023	watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring
 45024	church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock
 45025	reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is
 45026	caused by the position of the hands of the watch.
 45027	
 45028	Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see
 45029	the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude
 45030	that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the
 45031	movement of the engine.
 45032	
 45033	The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks
 45034	are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak
 45035	is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow
 45036	when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the
 45037	unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the
 45038	force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a
 45039	coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of
 45040	life, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the
 45041	hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the
 45042	oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine
 45043	moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I must entirely change my
 45044	point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the
 45045	bells, and of the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this
 45046	direction have already been made.
 45047	
 45048	To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of
 45049	our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and
 45050	study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are
 45051	moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance
 45052	in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is
 45053	evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering
 45054	the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much
 45055	mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has
 45056	been devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders,
 45057	and ministers and propounding the historiansâ own reflections concerning
 45058	these actions.

 45064	CHAPTER II
 45065	
 45066	The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The Russian
 45067	army and people avoided a collision till SmolÃ©nsk was reached, and again
 45068	from SmolÃ©nsk to BorodinÃ³. The French army pushed on to Moscow, its
 45069	goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the
 45070	velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth. Behind
 45071	it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead
 45072	were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal. Every soldier in
 45073	Napoleonâs army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.
 45074	
 45075	The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred
 45076	of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and
 45077	consolidated. At BorodinÃ³ a collision took place. Neither army was
 45078	broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately after the
 45079	collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another
 45080	having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability the ball
 45081	of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some
 45082	distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its force.
 45083	
 45084	The Russians retreated eighty milesâto beyond Moscowâand the French
 45085	reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks after that
 45086	there was not a single battle. The French did not move. As a bleeding,
 45087	mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained inert in Moscow
 45088	for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back:
 45089	they made a dash for the KalÃºga road, and (after a victoryâfor at
 45090	MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets the field of conflict again remained theirs) without
 45091	undertaking a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back
 45092	to SmolÃ©nsk, beyond SmolÃ©nsk, beyond the BerÃ«zina, beyond VÃ­lna, and
 45093	farther still.
 45094	
 45095	On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, KutÃºzov and the whole
 45096	Russian army were convinced that the battle of BorodinÃ³ was a victory.
 45097	KutÃºzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare for a
 45098	fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone,
 45099	but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who had taken
 45100	part in the battle knew it.
 45101	
 45102	But all that evening and next day reports came in one after another
 45103	of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle
 45104	proved physically impossible.
 45105	
 45106	It was impossible to give battle before information had been collected,
 45107	the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition replenished, the
 45108	slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to replace those who had been
 45109	killed, and before the men had had food and sleep. And meanwhile, the
 45110	very next morning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself
 45111	upon the Russians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now
 45112	seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
 45113	from its aim. KutÃºzovâs wish was to attack next day, and the whole
 45114	army desired to do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not
 45115	sufficient, there must also be a possibility of doing it, and that
 45116	possibility did not exist. It was impossible not to retreat a dayâs
 45117	march, and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another
 45118	and a third dayâs march, and at last, on the first of September when
 45119	the army drew near Moscowâdespite the strength of the feeling that had
 45120	arisen in all ranksâthe force of circumstances compelled it to retire
 45121	beyond Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, dayâs march, and
 45122	abandoned Moscow to the enemy.
 45123	
 45124	For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are
 45125	made by generalsâas anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may
 45126	imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battleâthe
 45127	questions present themselves: Why did KutÃºzov during the retreat not do
 45128	this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching FilÃ­?
 45129	Why did he not retire at once by the KalÃºga road, abandoning Moscow? and
 45130	so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know,
 45131	the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any
 45132	commander in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all
 45133	resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in
 45134	our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of
 45135	troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our
 45136	plans from some given moment. A commander in chief is never dealing with
 45137	the beginning of any eventâthe position from which we always contemplate
 45138	it. The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of
 45139	shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole
 45140	import of an event that is occurring. Moment by moment the event is
 45141	imperceptibly shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous,
 45142	uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the
 45143	midst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies,
 45144	authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is
 45145	continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him,
 45146	which constantly conflict with one another.
 45147	
 45148	Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that KutÃºzov should
 45149	have moved his army to the KalÃºga road long before reaching FilÃ­, and
 45150	that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander
 45151	in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not
 45152	one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based
 45153	on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.
 45154	
 45155	A commander in chiefâs business, it would seem, is simply to choose one
 45156	of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not
 45157	wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to
 45158	cross to the KalÃºga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from
 45159	MilorÃ¡dovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire. An
 45160	order must be given him at once, that instant. And the order to retreat
 45161	carries us past the turn to the KalÃºga road. And after the adjutant
 45162	comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken,
 45163	and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a
 45164	courier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does
 45165	not admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander in
 45166	chiefâs rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are always
 45167	not merely one but several such), presents a new project diametrically
 45168	opposed to that of turning to the KalÃºga road, and the commander in
 45169	chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and
 45170	a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of
 45171	rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the district pray to
 45172	be defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and
 45173	gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer
 45174	previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been
 45175	on reconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemyâs army
 45176	differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these
 45177	inevitable conditions of a commander in chiefâs actions describe to
 45178	us, for instance, the position of the army at FilÃ­ and assume that the
 45179	commander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide
 45180	whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army
 45181	less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had
 45182	that question been settled? At Drissa and at SmolÃ©nsk and most
 45183	palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at ShevÃ¡rdino and on
 45184	the twenty-sixth at BorodinÃ³, and each day and hour and minute of the
 45185	retreat from BorodinÃ³ to FilÃ­.

 45190	
 45191	CHAPTER III
 45192	
 45193	When ErmÃ³lov, having been sent by KutÃºzov to inspect the position, told
 45194	the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow
 45195	and that they must retreat, KutÃºzov looked at him in silence.
 45196	
 45197	âGive me your hand,â said he and, turning it over so as to feel the
 45198	pulse, added: âYou are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you are
 45199	saying!â
 45200	
 45201	KutÃºzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow
 45202	without a battle.
 45203	
 45204	On the PoklÃ³nny Hill, four miles from the DorogomÃ­lov gate of Moscow,
 45205	KutÃºzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside.
 45206	A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count RostopchÃ­n, who
 45207	had come out from Moscow, joined them. This brilliant company separated
 45208	into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages
 45209	of the position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the
 45210	situation of Moscow, and military questions generally. Though they had
 45211	not been summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they
 45212	all felt that this was really a council of war. The conversations all
 45213	dealt with public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal
 45214	news, it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general
 45215	matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all
 45216	these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the
 45217	height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking
 45218	among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose
 45219	bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might
 45220	overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said
 45221	and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself
 45222	take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing
 45223	what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned
 45224	away with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of
 45225	anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been
 45226	chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental
 45227	capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had
 45228	been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days
 45229	before. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was
 45230	described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform.
 45231	(This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian
 45232	army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the
 45233	possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.) Count RostopchÃ­n
 45234	was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city
 45235	train bands under the walls of the capital, but that he still could not
 45236	help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening, and
 45237	that had he known it sooner things would have been different.... A
 45238	fifth group, displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions,
 45239	discussed the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group
 45240	was talking absolute nonsense. KutÃºzovâs expression grew more and more
 45241	preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that
 45242	to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
 45243	those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless
 45244	commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the
 45245	battle would still not take place. It would not take place because the
 45246	commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but
 45247	in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its
 45248	inevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead their troops to
 45249	a field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade
 45250	officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the
 45251	position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced
 45252	as they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being
 45253	defended and others still discussed it, the question was no longer
 45254	important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue.
 45255	This KutÃºzov knew well.
 45256	
 45257	Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian
 45258	patriotism (KutÃºzov could not listen to this without wincing) by
 45259	insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight
 45260	to KutÃºzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on KutÃºzov who had
 45261	brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if
 45262	it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not
 45263	given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this
 45264	intrigue did not now occupy the old manâs mind. One terrible question
 45265	absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The
 45266	question for him now was: âHave I really allowed Napoleon to reach
 45267	Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been
 45268	yesterday when I ordered PlÃ¡tov to retreat, or was it the evening
 45269	before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it
 45270	earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow
 45271	must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must
 45272	be given.â To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to
 45273	resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to
 45274	which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince ProzorÃ³vski,
 45275	under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced
 45276	that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against
 45277	the Emperorâs wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen
 45278	commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain
 45279	command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all
 45280	the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear,
 45281	and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But
 45282	something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which
 45283	were assuming too free a character must be stopped.
 45284	
 45285	He called the most important generals to him.
 45286	
 45287	âMy head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,â said he, rising
 45288	from the bench, and he rode to FilÃ­ where his carriages were waiting.
 45289	
 45290	
 45291	
 45292	
 45293	
 45294	CHAPTER IV
 45295	
 45296	The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the
 45297	better and roomier part of Andrew SavostyÃ¡novâs hut. The men, women, and
 45298	children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across
 45299	the passage. Only MalÃ¡sha, Andrewâs six-year-old granddaughter whom
 45300	his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar
 45301	while drinking his tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the
 45302	larger room. MalÃ¡sha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the
 45303	faces, uniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another
 45304	came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner
 45305	under the icons. âGranddadâ himself, as MalÃ¡sha in her own mind called
 45306	KutÃºzov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep
 45307	in a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at
 45308	the collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed
 45309	to pinch his neck. Those who entered went up one by one to the field
 45310	marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant
 45311	KaysÃ¡rov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing
 45312	KutÃºzov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and KaysÃ¡rov understood
 45313	that his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.
 45314	
 45315	Round the peasantâs deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils, and
 45316	papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another
 45317	bench and put it beside the table. ErmÃ³lov, KaysÃ¡rov, and Toll, who had
 45318	just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost place, immediately
 45319	under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high forehead merging into
 45320	his bald crown. He had a St. Georgeâs Cross round his neck and looked
 45321	pale and ill. He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering
 45322	and in pain. Beside him sat UvÃ¡rov, who with rapid gesticulations was
 45323	giving him some information, speaking in low tones as they all did.
 45324	Chubby little DokhtÃºrov was listening attentively with eyebrows
 45325	raised and arms folded on his stomach. On the other side sat Count
 45326	Ostermann-TolstÃ³y, seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad
 45327	head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand.
 45328	RaÃ©vski, twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his
 45329	habit, glanced now at KutÃºzov and now at the door with a look of
 45330	impatience. KonovnÃ­tsynâs firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by
 45331	a tender, sly smile. His glance met MalÃ¡shaâs, and the expression of his
 45332	eyes caused the little girl to smile.
 45333	
 45334	They were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting
 45335	the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from
 45336	four till six oâclock and did not begin their deliberations all that
 45337	time but talked in low tones of other matters.
 45338	
 45339	Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did KutÃºzov leave his corner and
 45340	draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been
 45341	placed there to light up his face.
 45342	
 45343	Bennigsen opened the council with the question: âAre we to abandon
 45344	Russiaâs ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to
 45345	defend it?â A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown
 45346	on every face and only KutÃºzovâs angry grunts and occasional cough
 45347	broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. MalÃ¡sha too looked at
 45348	âGranddad.â She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he
 45349	seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.
 45350	
 45351	âRussiaâs ancient and sacred capital!â he suddenly said, repeating
 45352	Bennigsenâs words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the
 45353	false note in them. âAllow me to tell you, your excellency, that that
 45354	question has no meaning for a Russian.â (He lurched his heavy body
 45355	forward.) âSuch a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question
 45356	I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one.
 45357	The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow
 45358	without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well
 45359	as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion,â and he
 45360	sank back in his chair.
 45361	
 45362	The discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.
 45363	Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at
 45364	FilÃ­ was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love
 45365	of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank
 45366	during the night and attack the French right flank the following day.
 45367	Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced for and against that
 45368	project. ErmÃ³lov, DokhtÃºrov, and RaÃ©vski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether
 45369	feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital
 45370	or guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not
 45371	to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course
 45372	of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other
 45373	generals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of
 45374	Moscow, spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat.
 45375	MalÃ¡sha, who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her,
 45376	understood the meaning of the council differently. It seemed to her that
 45377	it was only a personal struggle between âGranddadâ and âLong-coatâ as
 45378	she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to
 45379	one another, and in her heart she sided with âGranddad.â In the midst of
 45380	the conversation she noticed âGranddadâ give Bennigsen a quick, subtle
 45381	glance, and then to her joys she saw that âGranddadâ said something to
 45382	âLong-coatâ which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced
 45383	angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was KutÃºzovâs calm
 45384	and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsenâs
 45385	proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to
 45386	attack the French right wing.
 45387	
 45388	âGentlemen,â said KutÃºzov, âI cannot approve of the countâs plan. Moving
 45389	troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military
 45390	history supports that view. For instance...â KutÃºzov seemed to reflect,
 45391	searching for an example, then with a clear, naÃ¯ve look at Bennigsen he
 45392	added: âOh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count
 45393	well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our
 45394	troops were rearranged too near the enemy....â
 45395	
 45396	There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.
 45397	
 45398	The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all
 45399	felt that there was no more to be said.
 45400	
 45401	During one of these pauses KutÃºzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to
 45402	speak. They all looked at him.
 45403	
 45404	âWell, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken
 45405	crockery,â said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. âGentlemen,
 45406	I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,â he
 45407	paused, âby the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country,
 45408	order a retreat.â
 45409	
 45410	After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and
 45411	circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.
 45412	
 45413	Some of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different from
 45414	the way they had spoken during the council, communicated something to
 45415	their commander in chief.
 45416	
 45417	MalÃ¡sha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully
 45418	backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its
 45419	projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted
 45420	out of the room.
 45421	
 45422	When he had dismissed the generals KutÃºzov sat a long time with his
 45423	elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question:
 45424	âWhen, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was
 45425	that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?â
 45426	
 45427	âI did not expect this,â said he to his adjutant Schneider when the
 45428	latter came in late that night. âI did not expect this! I did not think
 45429	this would happen.â
 45430	
 45431	âYou should take some rest, your Serene Highness,â replied Schneider.
 45432	
 45433	âBut no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!â exclaimed
 45434	KutÃºzov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist. âThey
 45435	shall too, if only...â
 45436	
 45437	
 45438	
 45439	
 45440	
 45441	CHAPTER V
 45442	
 45443	At that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating
 45444	without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow,
 45445	RostopchÃ­n, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that
 45446	event, acted in an altogether different manner from KutÃºzov.
 45447	
 45448	After the battle of BorodinÃ³ the abandonment and burning of Moscow was
 45449	as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.
 45450	
 45451	Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the
 45452	feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.
 45453	
 45454	The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns
 45455	and villages on Russian soil beginning with SmolÃ©nsk, without the
 45456	participation of Count RostopchÃ­n and his broadsheets. The people
 45457	awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear
 45458	anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to
 45459	find what it should do at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the
 45460	enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property,
 45461	while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.
 45462	
 45463	The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and
 45464	is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this,
 45465	and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian
 45466	Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July
 45467	and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who
 45468	went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half
 45469	their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses
 45470	itself not by phrases or by giving oneâs children to save the fatherland
 45471	and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically,
 45472	and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results.
 45473	
 45474	âIt is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running
 45475	away from Moscow,â they were told. In his broadsheets RostopchÃ­n
 45476	impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed
 45477	to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing
 45478	it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that
 45479	RostopchÃ­n had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had
 45480	committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the
 45481	rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had
 45482	remained intact and that during Napoleonâs occupation the inhabitants
 45483	had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen
 45484	whom the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so
 45485	much.
 45486	
 45487	They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to
 45488	whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It was
 45489	out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing
 45490	that could happen. They went away even before the battle of BorodinÃ³ and
 45491	still more rapidly after it, despite RostopchÃ­nâs calls to defend Moscow
 45492	or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of
 45493	the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were
 45494	to destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense RostopchÃ­n wrote in
 45495	his broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, and that
 45496	if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house
 45497	serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that
 45498	they must go away, sorry as they were to abandon their property
 45499	to destruction. They went away without thinking of the tremendous
 45500	significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to
 45501	destruction, for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when
 45502	abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned. They went away each on his
 45503	own account, and yet it was only in consequence of their going away
 45504	that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the
 45505	greatest glory of the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being
 45506	stopped by Count RostopchÃ­nâs orders, had already in June moved with her
 45507	Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her SarÃ¡tov estate, with
 45508	a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparteâs servant, was really,
 45509	simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia. But
 45510	Count RostopchÃ­n, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the
 45511	government offices removed; now distributed quite useless weapons to
 45512	the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the icons, and now
 45513	forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints; now
 45514	seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six
 45515	of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich; now
 45516	hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his
 45517	own house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding
 45518	them for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of
 45519	having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed;
 45520	now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, and now
 45521	reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from
 45522	Moscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-ChalmÃ© (the center of the whole
 45523	French colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered the venerable old
 45524	postmaster KlyucharÃ«v to be arrested and exiled for no particular
 45525	offense; now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French
 45526	and now, to get rid of them, handed over to them a man to be killed
 45527	and himself drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would
 45528	not survive the fall of Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums
 45529	concerning his share in the affairâthis man did not understand the
 45530	meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself
 45531	that would astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic
 45532	feat; and like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable
 45533	eventâthe abandonment and burning of Moscowâand tried with his puny hand
 45534	now to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him
 45535	along with it.

 45541	CHAPTER VI
 45542	
 45543	HÃ©lÃ¨ne, having returned with the court from VÃ­lna to Petersburg, found
 45544	herself in a difficult position.
 45545	
 45546	In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who
 45547	occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In VÃ­lna she had formed
 45548	an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she returned to Petersburg
 45549	both the magnate and the prince were there, and both claimed their
 45550	rights. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was faced by a new problemâhow to preserve her intimacy
 45551	with both without offending either.
 45552	
 45553	What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did
 45554	not cause the least embarrassment to Countess BezÃºkhova, who evidently
 45555	deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had she attempted
 45556	concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position
 45557	by cunning, she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself
 45558	guilty. But HÃ©lÃ¨ne, like a really great man who can do whatever
 45559	he pleases, at once assumed her own position to be correct, as she
 45560	sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else was to blame.
 45561	
 45562	The first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her, she
 45563	lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: âThatâs
 45564	just like a manâselfish and cruel! I expected nothing else. A woman
 45565	sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her reward! What
 45566	right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and
 45567	friendships? He is a man who has been more than a father to me!â The
 45568	prince was about to say something, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne interrupted him.
 45569	
 45570	âWell, yes,â said she, âit may be that he has other sentiments for me
 45571	than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door
 45572	on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude!
 45573	Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I
 45574	render account only to God and to my conscience,â she concluded, laying
 45575	her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to
 45576	heaven.
 45577	
 45578	âBut for heavenâs sake listen to me!â
 45579	
 45580	âMarry me, and I will be your slave!â
 45581	
 45582	âBut thatâs impossible.â
 45583	
 45584	âYou wonât deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne,
 45585	beginning to cry.
 45586	
 45587	The prince tried to comfort her, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne, as if quite distraught,
 45588	said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,
 45589	that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but
 45590	she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had
 45591	never been her husbandâs wife, and that she had been sacrificed.
 45592	
 45593	âBut the law, religion...â said the prince, already yielding.
 45594	
 45595	âThe law, religion... What have they been invented for if they canât
 45596	arrange that?â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 45597	
 45598	The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him,
 45599	and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the Society of Jesus,
 45600	with whom he was on intimate terms.
 45601	
 45602	A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which HÃ©lÃ¨ne gave at
 45603	her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert,
 45604	a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes,
 45605	a Jesuit Ã  robe courte * was presented to her, and in the garden by the
 45606	light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a
 45607	long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the
 45608	consolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and
 45609	the next. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes
 45610	and to those of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance,
 45611	for which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with
 45612	her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de
 45613	Jobert came to see HÃ©lÃ¨ne when she was alone, and after that often came
 45614	again.
 45615	
 45616	    * Lay member of the Society of Jesus.
 45617	
 45618	One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt
 45619	down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged
 45620	Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward
 45621	described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her
 45622	soul. It was explained to her that this was la grÃ¢ce.
 45623	
 45624	After that a long-frocked abbÃ© was brought to her. She confessed to
 45625	him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box
 45626	containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to
 45627	partake of. A few days later HÃ©lÃ¨ne learned with pleasure that she had
 45628	now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the
 45629	Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document.
 45630	
 45631	All that was done around her and to her at this time, all the attention
 45632	devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant,
 45633	refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore
 45634	only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure,
 45635	but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim. And
 45636	as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets
 45637	the better of cleverer ones, HÃ©lÃ¨neâhaving realized that the main object
 45638	of all these words and all this trouble was, after converting her to
 45639	Catholicism, to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to
 45640	which she received indications)âbefore parting with her money insisted
 45641	that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband
 45642	should be performed. In her view the aim of every religion was merely
 45643	to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to
 45644	human desires. And with this aim, in one of her talks with her Father
 45645	Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the question, in how far was she
 45646	bound by her marriage?
 45647	
 45648	They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.
 45649	The scent of flowers came in at the window. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was wearing a white
 45650	dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbÃ©, a well-fed
 45651	man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white
 45652	hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to HÃ©lÃ¨ne and, with a
 45653	subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty,
 45654	occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the
 45655	subject. HÃ©lÃ¨ne with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his
 45656	plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every moment expected the
 45657	conversation to take a fresh turn. But the abbÃ©, though he evidently
 45658	enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was absorbed in his mastery of the
 45659	matter.
 45660	
 45661	The course of the Father Confessorâs arguments ran as follows: âIgnorant
 45662	of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow of conjugal
 45663	fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married state without
 45664	faith in the religious significance of marriage, committed an act of
 45665	sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have
 45666	had. Yet in spite of this your vow was binding. You swerved from it.
 45667	What did you commit by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial
 45668	sin, for you acted without evil intention. If now you married again
 45669	with the object of bearing children, your sin might be forgiven. But the
 45670	question is again a twofold one: firstly...â
 45671	
 45672	But suddenly HÃ©lÃ¨ne, who was getting bored, said with one of her
 45673	bewitching smiles: âBut I think that having espoused the true religion I
 45674	cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.â
 45675	
 45676	The director of her conscience was astounded at having the case
 45677	presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbusâ egg. He was
 45678	delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupilâs progress, but could
 45679	not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.
 45680	
 45681	âLet us understand one another, Countess,â said he with a smile, and
 45682	began refuting his spiritual daughterâs arguments.
 45683	
 45684	
 45685	
 45686	
 45687	
 45688	CHAPTER VII
 45689	
 45690	HÃ©lÃ¨ne understood that the question was very simple and easy from
 45691	the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making
 45692	difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter
 45693	would be regarded by the secular authorities.
 45694	
 45695	So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society.
 45696	She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she
 45697	had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only
 45698	way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly
 45699	magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage
 45700	with a woman whose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but
 45701	HÃ©lÃ¨neâs imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as
 45702	marrying a maiden had its effect on him too. Had HÃ©lÃ¨ne herself shown
 45703	the least sign of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would
 45704	certainly have been lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy
 45705	or shame, on the contrary, with good-natured naÃ¯vetÃ© she told her
 45706	intimate friends (and these were all Petersburg) that both the prince
 45707	and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was
 45708	afraid of grieving either.
 45709	
 45710	A rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that HÃ©lÃ¨ne wanted to
 45711	be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have
 45712	opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and
 45713	interesting HÃ©lÃ¨ne was in doubt which of the two men she should marry.
 45714	The question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was
 45715	the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There
 45716	were, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of
 45717	such a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament
 45718	of marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent,
 45719	while the majority were interested in HÃ©lÃ¨neâs good fortune and in the
 45720	question which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was
 45721	right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not
 45722	discuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people âwiser
 45723	than you or me,â as they said, and to doubt the correctness of that
 45724	decision would be to risk exposing oneâs stupidity and incapacity to
 45725	live in society.
 45726	
 45727	Only MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna AkhrosÃ­mova, who had come to Petersburg that
 45728	summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express
 45729	an opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting HÃ©lÃ¨ne at a ball she
 45730	stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said
 45731	in her gruff voice: âSo wives of living men have started marrying
 45732	again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been
 45733	forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all the
 45734	brothels,â and with these words MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, turning up her wide
 45735	sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round,
 45736	moved across the room.
 45737	
 45738	Though people were afraid of MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna she was regarded in
 45739	Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed,
 45740	and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing
 45741	the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.
 45742	
 45743	Prince VasÃ­li, who of late very often forgot what he had said and
 45744	repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his
 45745	daughter whenever he chanced to see her:
 45746	
 45747	âHÃ©lÃ¨ne, I have a word to say to you,â and he would lead her
 45748	aside, drawing her hand downward. âI have heard of certain projects
 45749	concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your fatherâs
 45750	heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my
 45751	dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to say,â and
 45752	concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his
 45753	daughterâs and move away.
 45754	
 45755	BilÃ­bin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,
 45756	and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as
 45757	HÃ©lÃ¨ne always hasâmen friends who can never change into loversâonce gave
 45758	her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.
 45759	
 45760	âListen, BilÃ­bin,â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne (she always called friends of that sort
 45761	by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white,
 45762	beringed fingers. âTell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do.
 45763	Which of the two?â
 45764	
 45765	BilÃ­bin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a
 45766	smile on his lips.
 45767	
 45768	âYou are not taking me unawares, you know,â said he. âAs a true friend,
 45769	I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see, if you
 45770	marry the princeââhe meant the younger manâand he crooked one finger,
 45771	âyou forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will
 45772	displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of
 45773	connection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last days
 45774	happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making
 45775	a mÃ©salliance by marrying you,â and BilÃ­bin smoothed out his forehead.
 45776	
 45777	âThatâs a true friend!â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne beaming, and again touching
 45778	BilÃ­binâs sleeve. âBut I love them, you know, and donât want to distress
 45779	either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of them both.â
 45780	
 45781	BilÃ­bin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could
 45782	help in that difficulty.
 45783	
 45784	âUne maÃ®tresse-femme! * Thatâs what is called putting things squarely.
 45785	She would like to be married to all three at the same time,â thought he.
 45786	
 45787	    * A masterly woman.
 45788	
 45789	âBut tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?â BilÃ­bin asked,
 45790	his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so
 45791	naÃ¯ve a question. âWill he agree?â
 45792	
 45793	âOh, he loves me so!â said HÃ©lÃ¨ne, who for some reason imagined that
 45794	Pierre too loved her. âHe will do anything for me.â
 45795	
 45796	BilÃ­bin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.
 45797	
 45798	âEven divorce you?â said he.
 45799	
 45800	HÃ©lÃ¨ne laughed.
 45801	
 45802	Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed
 45803	marriage was HÃ©lÃ¨neâs mother, Princess KurÃ¡gina. She was continually
 45804	tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned
 45805	a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the
 45806	idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce
 45807	and remarriage during a husbandâs lifetime, and the priest told her that
 45808	it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel
 45809	which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband
 45810	is alive.
 45811	
 45812	Armed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she
 45813	drove to her daughterâs early one morning so as to find her alone.
 45814	
 45815	Having listened to her motherâs objections, HÃ©lÃ¨ne smiled blandly and
 45816	ironically.
 45817	
 45818	âBut it says plainly: âWhosoever shall marry her that is divorced...ââ
 45819	said the old princess.
 45820	
 45821	âAh, Maman, ne dites pas de bÃªtises. Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma
 45822	position jâai des devoirs,â * said HÃ©lÃ¨ne changing from Russian, in
 45823	which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear,
 45824	into French which suited it better.
 45825	
 45826	     * âOh, Mamma, donât talk nonsense! You donât understand
 45827	     anything. In my position I have obligations.â
 45828	
 45829	
 45830	âBut, my dear....â
 45831	
 45832	âOh, Mamma, how is it you donât understand that the Holy Father, who has
 45833	the right to grant dispensations...â
 45834	
 45835	Just then the lady companion who lived with HÃ©lÃ¨ne came in to announce
 45836	that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.
 45837	
 45838	âNon, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse contre
 45839	lui, parce quâil mâa manquÃ© parole.â *
 45840	
 45841	     * âNo, tell him I donât wish to see him, I am furious with
 45842	     him for not keeping his word to me.â
 45843	
 45844	
 45845	âComtesse, Ã  tout pÃ©chÃ© misÃ©ricorde,â * said a fair-haired young man
 45846	with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.
 45847	
 45848	    * âCountess, there is mercy for every sin.â
 45849	
 45850	
 45851	The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who had
 45852	entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and
 45853	sidled out of the room.
 45854	
 45855	âYes, she is right,â thought the old princess, all her convictions
 45856	dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. âShe is right, but how
 45857	is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so
 45858	simple,â she thought as she got into her carriage.
 45859	
 45860	
 45861	By the beginning of August HÃ©lÃ¨neâs affairs were clearly defined and
 45862	she wrote a letter to her husbandâwho, as she imagined, loved her very
 45863	muchâinforming him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having
 45864	embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the
 45865	formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to him by
 45866	the bearer of the letter.
 45867	
 45868	And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful
 45869	keepingâYour friend HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 45870	
 45871	This letter was brought to Pierreâs house when he was on the field of
 45872	BorodinÃ³.
 45873	
 45874	
 45875	
 45876	
 45877	
 45878	CHAPTER VIII
 45879	
 45880	Toward the end of the battle of BorodinÃ³, Pierre, having run down
 45881	from RaÃ©vskiâs battery a second time, made his way through a gully to
 45882	KnyazkÃ³vo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and
 45883	seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in
 45884	the crowds of soldiers.
 45885	
 45886	The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly
 45887	from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return
 45888	to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own
 45889	bed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he
 45890	be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such
 45891	ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.
 45892	
 45893	Though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he
 45894	was going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field
 45895	of battle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes
 45896	strangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiersâ
 45897	overcoats, the same sounds of firing which, though distant now, still
 45898	aroused terror, and besides this there were the foul air and the dust.
 45899	
 45900	Having gone a couple of miles along the MozhÃ¡ysk road, Pierre sat down
 45901	by the roadside.
 45902	
 45903	Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on
 45904	his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in
 45905	the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying
 45906	toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He
 45907	had no idea how long he had been there. In the middle of the night three
 45908	soldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began
 45909	lighting a fire.
 45910	
 45911	The soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn
 45912	and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and
 45913	put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with
 45914	the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were
 45915	eating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.
 45916	
 45917	âAnd who may you be?â one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently
 45918	meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: âIf you want to eat
 45919	weâll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest
 45920	man.â
 45921	
 45922	âI, I...â said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social
 45923	position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and
 45924	better understood by them. âBy rights I am a militia officer, but my men
 45925	are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them.â
 45926	
 45927	âThere now!â said one of the soldiers.
 45928	
 45929	Another shook his head.
 45930	
 45931	âWould you like a little mash?â the first soldier asked, and handed
 45932	Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.
 45933	
 45934	Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called
 45935	the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food
 45936	he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself
 45937	to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by
 45938	the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.
 45939	
 45940	âWhere have you to go to? Tell us!â said one of them.
 45941	
 45942	âTo MozhÃ¡ysk.â
 45943	
 45944	âYouâre a gentleman, arenât you?â
 45945	
 45946	âYes.â
 45947	
 45948	âAnd whatâs your name?â
 45949	
 45950	âPeter KirÃ­lych.â
 45951	
 45952	âWell then, Peter KirÃ­lych, come along with us, weâll take you there.â
 45953	
 45954	In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to MozhÃ¡ysk.
 45955	
 45956	By the time they got near MozhÃ¡ysk and began ascending the steep hill
 45957	into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the
 45958	soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill
 45959	and that he had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered
 45960	this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the
 45961	hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the
 45962	town and was returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the
 45963	darkness by his white hat.
 45964	
 45965	âYour excellency!â he said. âWhy, we were beginning to despair! How is
 45966	it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?â
 45967	
 45968	âOh, yes!â said Pierre.
 45969	
 45970	The soldiers stopped.
 45971	
 45972	âSo youâve found your folk?â said one of them. âWell, good-by, Peter
 45973	KirÃ­lychâisnât it?â
 45974	
 45975	âGood-by, Peter KirÃ­lych!â Pierre heard the other voices repeat.
 45976	
 45977	âGood-by!â he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.
 45978	
 45979	âI ought to give them something!â he thought, and felt in his pocket.
 45980	âNo, better not!â said another, inner voice.
 45981	
 45982	There was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied.
 45983	Pierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay
 45984	down in his carriage.
 45985	
 45986	
 45987	
 45988	
 45989	
 45990	CHAPTER IX
 45991	
 45992	Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself
 45993	falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality,
 45994	he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans
 45995	and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and
 45996	dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and
 45997	lifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only
 45998	someoneâs orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud,
 45999	and talked to the innkeeper. Above Pierreâs head some pigeons, disturbed
 46000	by the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof
 46001	of the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful
 46002	smell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see
 46003	the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.
 46004	
 46005	âThank God, there is no more of that!â he thought, covering up his head
 46006	again. âOh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded
 46007	to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the
 46008	end...â thought he.
 46009	
 46010	They, in Pierreâs mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the
 46011	battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before
 46012	the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out
 46013	clearly and sharply from everyone else.
 46014	
 46015	âTo be a soldier, just a soldier!â thought Pierre as he fell asleep,
 46016	âto enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what
 46017	they are. But how to cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my
 46018	outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run
 46019	away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve
 46020	as a soldier after the duel with DÃ³lokhov.â And the memory of the dinner
 46021	at the English Club when he had challenged DÃ³lokhov flashed through
 46022	Pierreâs mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at TorzhÃ³k. And now
 46023	a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind.
 46024	It was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him
 46025	sat at the end of the table. âYes, that is he! It is my benefactor.
 46026	But he died!â thought Pierre. âYes, he died, and I did not know he was
 46027	alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive
 46028	again!â On one side of the table sat Anatole, DÃ³lokhov, NesvÃ­tski,
 46029	DenÃ­sov, and others like them (in his dream the category to which these
 46030	men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of
 46031	those he termed they), and he heard those people, Anatole and DÃ³lokhov,
 46032	shouting and singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his
 46033	benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words
 46034	was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but
 46035	pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor
 46036	was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite
 46037	distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the
 46038	possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,
 46039	firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they were
 46040	kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing to
 46041	speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his
 46042	legs grew cold and bare.
 46043	
 46044	He felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak
 46045	had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre
 46046	opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but
 46047	now they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.
 46048	
 46049	âIt is dawn,â thought Pierre. âBut thatâs not what I want. I want to
 46050	hear and understand my benefactorâs words.â Again he covered himself up
 46051	with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there.
 46052	There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that
 46053	someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.
 46054	
 46055	Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that
 46056	someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that
 46057	day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think
 46058	and express his thoughts like that when awake.
 46059	
 46060	âTo endure war is the most difficult subordination of manâs freedom to
 46061	the law of God,â the voice had said. âSimplicity is submission to the
 46062	will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they are simple. They do
 46063	not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden.
 46064	Man can be master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not
 46065	fear it possesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know
 46066	his limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went
 46067	on thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to
 46068	unite the meaning of all. To unite all?â he asked himself. âNo, not
 46069	to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts
 46070	together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness
 46071	them!â he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these
 46072	words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the
 46073	question that tormented him.
 46074	
 46075	âYes, one must harness, it is time to harness.â
 46076	
 46077	âTime to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!â
 46078	some voice was repeating. âWe must harness, it is time to harness....â
 46079	
 46080	It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone
 46081	straight into Pierreâs face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the
 46082	middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump
 46083	while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with
 46084	repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat.
 46085	âNo, I donât want that, I donât want to see and understand that. I want
 46086	to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream. One second
 46087	more and I should have understood it all! But what am I to do? Harness,
 46088	but how can I harness everything?â and Pierre felt with horror that the
 46089	meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed.
 46090	
 46091	The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer
 46092	had come with news that the French were already near MozhÃ¡ysk and that
 46093	our men were leaving it.
 46094	
 46095	Pierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on
 46096	foot through the town.
 46097	
 46098	The troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind
 46099	them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and
 46100	the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that
 46101	were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could
 46102	be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken
 46103	him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the
 46104	way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of
 46105	that of Prince Andrew.
 46106	
 46107	
 46108	
 46109	
 46110	
 46111	CHAPTER X
 46112	
 46113	On the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of
 46114	the city he was met by Count RostopchÃ­nâs adjutant.
 46115	
 46116	âWe have been looking for you everywhere,â said the adjutant. âThe count
 46117	wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a
 46118	very important matter.â
 46119	
 46120	Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow
 46121	commander in chief.
 46122	
 46123	Count RostopchÃ­n had only that morning returned to town from his summer
 46124	villa at SokÃ³lniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house
 46125	were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders.
 46126	VasÃ­lchikov and PlÃ¡tov had already seen the count and explained to him
 46127	that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be
 46128	surrendered. Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants,
 46129	the officialsâthe heads of the various government departmentsâknew that
 46130	Moscow would soon be in the enemyâs hands, just as Count RostopchÃ­n
 46131	himself knew it, and to escape personal responsibility they had all
 46132	come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various
 46133	departments.
 46134	
 46135	As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came
 46136	out of RostopchÃ­nâs private room.
 46137	
 46138	In answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a
 46139	despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.
 46140	
 46141	While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the
 46142	various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there.
 46143	They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of
 46144	men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their
 46145	conversation.
 46146	
 46147	âIf theyâre sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,
 46148	but as things are now one canât answer for anything.â
 46149	
 46150	âBut you see what he writes...â said another, pointing to a printed
 46151	sheet he held in his hand.
 46152	
 46153	âThatâs another matter. Thatâs necessary for the people,â said the
 46154	first.
 46155	
 46156	âWhat is it?â asked Pierre.
 46157	
 46158	âOh, itâs a fresh broadsheet.â
 46159	
 46160	Pierre took it and began reading.
 46161	
 46162	His Serene Highness has passed through MozhÃ¡ysk in order to join up with
 46163	the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where
 46164	the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty-eight guns with ammunition
 46165	have been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he will
 46166	defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in
 46167	the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed;
 46168	things have to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our
 46169	own way! When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and
 46170	will raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet
 46171	so I hold my peace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a
 46172	three-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a
 46173	sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of
 46174	the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will
 46175	have some water blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I,
 46176	too, am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout
 46177	with both.
 46178	
 46179	âBut military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the
 46180	town,â said Pierre, âand that the position...â
 46181	
 46182	âWell, of course! Thatâs what we were saying,â replied the first
 46183	speaker.
 46184	
 46185	âAnd what does he mean by âOne of my eyes was sore but now I am on the
 46186	lookout with bothâ?â asked Pierre.
 46187	
 46188	âThe count had a sty,â replied the adjutant smiling, âand was very much
 46189	upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with
 46190	him. By the by, Count,â he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a
 46191	smile, âwe heard that you have family troubles and that the countess,
 46192	your wife...â
 46193	
 46194	âI have heard nothing,â Pierre replied unconcernedly. âBut what have you
 46195	heard?â
 46196	
 46197	âOh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I
 46198	heard.â
 46199	
 46200	âBut what did you hear?â
 46201	
 46202	âWell, they say,â continued the adjutant with the same smile, âthat
 46203	the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect itâs
 46204	nonsense....â
 46205	
 46206	âPossibly,â remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. âAnd who
 46207	is that?â he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant
 46208	overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face.
 46209	
 46210	âHe? Thatâs a tradesman, that is to say, heâs the restaurant
 46211	keeper, VereshchÃ¡gin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the
 46212	proclamation.â
 46213	
 46214	âOh, so that is VereshchÃ¡gin!â said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm
 46215	face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.
 46216	
 46217	âThatâs not he himself, thatâs the father of the fellow who wrote the
 46218	proclamation,â said the adjutant. âThe young man is in prison and I
 46219	expect it will go hard with him.â
 46220	
 46221	An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a
 46222	cross round his neck, approached the speaker.
 46223	
 46224	âItâs a complicated story, you know,â said the adjutant. âThat
 46225	proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of
 46226	it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel IvÃ¡novich
 46227	here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly
 46228	sixty-three hands. He asked one, âFrom whom did you get it?â âFrom
 46229	so-and-so.â He went to the next one. âFrom whom did you get it?â and so
 46230	on till he reached VereshchÃ¡gin, a half educated tradesman, you know, âa
 46231	pet of a trader,ââ said the adjutant smiling. âThey asked him, âWho gave
 46232	it you?â And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could
 46233	only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to
 46234	some understanding. He replied: âFrom no one; I made it up myself.â
 46235	They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: âI made it
 46236	up myself.â And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man.
 46237	âFrom whom did you get the proclamation?â âI wrote it myself.â Well, you
 46238	know the count,â said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride,
 46239	âhe flared up dreadfullyâand just think of the fellowâs audacity, lying,
 46240	and obstinacy!â
 46241	
 46242	âAnd the count wanted him to say it was from KlyucharÃ«v? I understand!â
 46243	said Pierre.
 46244	
 46245	âNot at all,â rejoined the adjutant in dismay. âKlyucharÃ«v had his own
 46246	sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished.
 46247	But the point is that the count was much annoyed. âHow could you have
 46248	written it yourself?â said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that
 46249	was lying on the table. âHere it is! You did not write it yourself but
 46250	translated it, and translated it abominably, because you donât even know
 46251	French, you fool.â And what do you think? âNo,â said he, âI have not
 46252	read any papers, I made it up myself.â âIf thatâs so, youâre a traitor
 46253	and Iâll have you tried, and youâll be hanged! Say from whom you had
 46254	it.â âI have seen no papers, I made it up myself.â And that was the end
 46255	of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it.
 46256	He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the
 46257	father has come to intercede for him. But heâs a good-for-nothing lad!
 46258	You know that sort of tradesmanâs son, a dandy and lady-killer. He
 46259	attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match
 46260	for him. Thatâs the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop
 46261	here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God
 46262	Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other.
 46263	Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?
 46264	He found some scoundrel of a painter...â
 46265	
 46266	
 46267	
 46268	
 46269	
 46270	CHAPTER XI
 46271	
 46272	In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in
 46273	chief.
 46274	
 46275	When he entered the private room Count RostopchÃ­n, puckering his face,
 46276	was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying
 46277	something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.
 46278	
 46279	âAh, how do you do, great warrior?â said RostopchÃ­n as soon as the short
 46280	man had left the room. âWe have heard of your prowess. But thatâs not
 46281	the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?â he
 46282	went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which
 46283	he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. âI am well
 46284	informed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope
 46285	that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to
 46286	ruin Russia.â
 46287	
 46288	âYes, I am a Mason,â Pierre replied.
 46289	
 46290	âThere, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. SperÃ¡nski and
 46291	MagnÃ­tski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. KlyucharÃ«v has
 46292	been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of
 46293	building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of
 46294	their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and
 46295	that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful
 46296	person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage
 46297	for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from
 46298	him for safe custody. I like you and donât wish you any harm andâas
 46299	you are only half my ageâI advise you, as a father would, to cease
 46300	all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as
 46301	possible.â
 46302	
 46303	âBut what did KlyucharÃ«v do wrong, Count?â asked Pierre.
 46304	
 46305	âThat is for me to know, but not for you to ask,â shouted RostopchÃ­n.
 46306	
 46307	âIf he is accused of circulating Napoleonâs proclamation it is not
 46308	proved that he did so,â said Pierre without looking at RostopchÃ­n, âand
 46309	VereshchÃ¡gin...â
 46310	
 46311	âThere we are!â RostopchÃ­n shouted at Pierre louder than before,
 46312	frowning suddenly. âVereshchÃ¡gin is a renegade and a traitor who will
 46313	be punished as he deserves,â said he with the vindictive heat with which
 46314	people speak when recalling an insult. âBut I did not summon you to
 46315	discuss my actions, but to give you adviceâor an order if you prefer it.
 46316	I beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such
 46317	men as KlyucharÃ«v. And I will knock the nonsense out of anybodyââbut
 46318	probably realizing that he was shouting at BezÃºkhov who so far was not
 46319	guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierreâs hand in a friendly manner,
 46320	âWe are on the eve of a public disaster and I havenât time to be polite
 46321	to everybody who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl.
 46322	Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?â
 46323	
 46324	âWhy, nothing,â answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the
 46325	thoughtful expression of his face.
 46326	
 46327	The count frowned.
 46328	
 46329	âA word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, thatâs
 46330	all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear
 46331	fellow. Oh, by the by!â he shouted through the doorway after Pierre,
 46332	âis it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy
 46333	fathers of the Society of Jesus?â
 46334	
 46335	Pierre did not answer and left RostopchÃ­nâs room more sullen and angry
 46336	than he had ever before shown himself.
 46337	
 46338	When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had
 46339	come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel
 46340	of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners.
 46341	They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre
 46342	did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and
 46343	only answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone
 46344	at last he opened and read his wifeâs letter.
 46345	
 46346	âThey, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old
 46347	man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the
 46348	meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One
 46349	must forget and understand...â And going to his bed he threw himself on
 46350	it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.
 46351	
 46352	When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a
 46353	special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count RostopchÃ­n to
 46354	know whether Count BezÃºkhov had left or was leaving the town.
 46355	
 46356	A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the
 46357	drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see
 46358	them, went to the back porch and out through the gate.
 46359	
 46360	From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of
 46361	BezÃºkhovâs household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again
 46362	or knew where he was.
 46363	
 46364	
 46365	
 46366	
 46367	
 46368	CHAPTER XII
 46369	
 46370	The RostÃ³vs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is,
 46371	till the eve of the enemyâs entry into the city.
 46372	
 46373	After PÃ©tya had joined ObolÃ©nskiâs regiment of Cossacks and left for
 46374	BÃ©laya TsÃ©rkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized
 46375	with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both
 46376	gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them
 46377	might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck
 46378	her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to
 46379	get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join PÃ©tya, or to get
 46380	him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved
 46381	possible. PÃ©tya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless
 46382	he was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nicholas was
 46383	somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter,
 46384	in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess
 46385	Mary. The countess did not sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep
 46386	dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. After many consultations and
 46387	conversations, the count at last devised means to tranquillize her. He
 46388	got PÃ©tya transferred from ObolÃ©nskiâs regiment to BezÃºkhovâs, which was
 46389	in training near Moscow. Though PÃ©tya would remain in the service, this
 46390	transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one
 46391	of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her
 46392	PÃ©tya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to
 46393	places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As long as
 46394	Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her
 46395	first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself
 46396	for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at
 46397	lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a
 46398	nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed PÃ©tya with his merry black eyes
 46399	and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to showâwhen
 46400	he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting
 46401	somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in itâthen
 46402	his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other
 46403	children. The nearer the time came for PÃ©tya to return, the more uneasy
 46404	grew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such
 46405	happiness. The presence of SÃ³nya, of her beloved NatÃ¡sha, or even of
 46406	her husband irritated her. âWhat do I want with them? I want no one but
 46407	PÃ©tya,â she thought.
 46408	
 46409	At the end of August the RostÃ³vs received another letter from Nicholas.
 46410	He wrote from the province of VorÃ³nezh where he had been sent to procure
 46411	remounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that
 46412	one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about PÃ©tya.
 46413	
 46414	Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the RostÃ³vsâ acquaintances
 46415	had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to
 46416	get away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before
 46417	her treasure, her adored PÃ©tya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August
 46418	he arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him
 46419	did not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from
 46420	him her intention of keeping him under her wing, PÃ©tya guessed her
 46421	designs, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion
 46422	when with herâmight âbecome womanishâ as he termed it to himselfâhe
 46423	treated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached
 46424	himself exclusively to NatÃ¡sha for whom he had always had a particularly
 46425	brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.
 46426	
 46427	Owing to the countâs customary carelessness nothing was ready for their
 46428	departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to
 46429	come from their RyazÃ¡n and Moscow estates to remove their household
 46430	belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.
 46431	
 46432	From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle
 46433	and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at BorodinÃ³ were
 46434	brought in by the DorogomÃ­lov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow,
 46435	and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions
 46436	out by the other gates. In spite of RostopchÃ­nâs broadsheets, or because
 46437	of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory
 46438	rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed
 46439	to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had
 46440	been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave.
 46441	Some said there had been another battle after BorodinÃ³ at which the
 46442	French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the
 46443	Russian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia
 46444	which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others
 46445	whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had
 46446	been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their
 46447	way from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in reality
 46448	(though the Council of FilÃ­, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow,
 46449	had not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained
 46450	behind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly
 46451	be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and
 46452	save their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break
 46453	up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so.
 46454	As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die
 46455	immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is
 46456	awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,
 46457	though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the
 46458	conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would
 46459	be completely upset.
 46460	
 46461	During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole
 46462	RostÃ³v family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the
 46463	family, Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, continually drove about the city collecting
 46464	the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders
 46465	at home about the preparations for their departure.
 46466	
 46467	The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with
 46468	everything, was constantly in pursuit of PÃ©tya who was always running
 46469	away from her, and was jealous of NatÃ¡sha with whom he spent all his
 46470	time. SÃ³nya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting
 46471	things packed. But of late SÃ³nya had been particularly sad and silent.
 46472	Nicholasâ letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in
 46473	her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention
 46474	of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.
 46475	
 46476	âI was never pleased at BolkÃ³nskiâs engagement to NatÃ¡sha,â said the
 46477	countess, âbut I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a
 46478	presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!â
 46479	
 46480	SÃ³nya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving
 46481	the RostÃ³vsâ affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the
 46482	princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite
 46483	her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the
 46484	difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and
 46485	was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they
 46486	had any orders to give. PÃ©tya and NatÃ¡sha on the contrary, far from
 46487	helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to
 46488	everyone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running
 46489	feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were
 46490	gay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and
 46491	mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause
 46492	for gaiety and laughter to them. PÃ©tya was in high spirits because
 46493	having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine
 46494	young man, because he was at home, because he had left BÃ©laya TsÃ©rkov
 46495	where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to
 46496	Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because
 46497	NatÃ¡sha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. NatÃ¡sha was
 46498	gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of
 46499	the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also
 46500	happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others was
 46501	a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freelyâand
 46502	PÃ©tya adored her. Above all, they were gay because there was a war near
 46503	Moscow, there would be fighting at the town gates, arms were being
 46504	given out, everybody was escapingâgoing away somewhere, and in general
 46505	something extraordinary was happening, and that is always exciting,
 46506	especially to the young.
 46507

 46509	
 46510	
 46511	
 46512	CHAPTER XIII
 46513	
 46514	On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the RostÃ³vsâ
 46515	house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was
 46516	being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been
 46517	taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and
 46518	ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out
 46519	the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was
 46520	crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up,
 46521	others still empty.
 46522	
 46523	The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who
 46524	had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in
 46525	the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The
 46526	countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was
 46527	lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head.
 46528	PÃ©tya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant
 46529	to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army. SÃ³nya was in
 46530	the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. NatÃ¡sha
 46531	was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons,
 46532	and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and
 46533	holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which
 46534	she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.
 46535	
 46536	NatÃ¡sha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and
 46537	several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was
 46538	not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except
 46539	with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside
 46540	SÃ³nya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave
 46541	it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it
 46542	amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was
 46543	done and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.
 46544	
 46545	âDunyÃ¡sha, you pack! You will, wonât you, dear?â And when DunyÃ¡sha
 46546	willingly promised to do it all for her, NatÃ¡sha sat down on the floor,
 46547	took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what
 46548	ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie
 46549	by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the
 46550	sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. NatÃ¡sha got
 46551	up and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of
 46552	wounded men had stopped in the street.
 46553	
 46554	The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,
 46555	postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.
 46556	
 46557	NatÃ¡sha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding
 46558	an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.
 46559	
 46560	The former housekeeper, old MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna, had stepped out of the
 46561	crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast
 46562	mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.
 46563	NatÃ¡sha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her
 46564	handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.
 46565	
 46566	âThen you have nobody in Moscow?â she was saying. âYou would be more
 46567	comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family
 46568	are leaving.â
 46569	
 46570	âI donât know if it would be allowed,â replied the officer in a weak
 46571	voice. âHere is our commanding officer... ask him,â and he pointed to a
 46572	stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.
 46573	
 46574	NatÃ¡sha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer
 46575	and at once went to meet the major.
 46576	
 46577	âMay the wounded men stay in our house?â she asked.
 46578	
 46579	The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.
 46580	
 46581	âWhich one do you want, Maâamâselle?â said he, screwing up his eyes and
 46582	smiling.
 46583	
 46584	NatÃ¡sha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole
 46585	manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her
 46586	handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflectionâas
 46587	if considering in how far the thing was possibleâreplied in the
 46588	affirmative.
 46589	
 46590	âOh yes, why not? They may,â he said.
 46591	
 46592	With a slight inclination of her head, NatÃ¡sha stepped back quickly to
 46593	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.
 46594	
 46595	âThey may. He says they may!â whispered NatÃ¡sha.
 46596	
 46597	The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the RostÃ³vsâ yard,
 46598	and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the
 46599	townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the
 46600	houses in PovarskÃ¡ya Street. NatÃ¡sha was evidently pleased to be dealing
 46601	with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and MÃ¡vra
 46602	KuzmÃ­nichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their
 46603	yard.
 46604	
 46605	âYour Papa must be told, though,â said MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna.
 46606	
 46607	âNever mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move
 46608	into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.â
 46609	
 46610	âThere now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we
 46611	put them into the wing, the menâs room, or the nurseâs room, we must ask
 46612	permission.â
 46613	
 46614	âWell, Iâll ask.â
 46615	
 46616	NatÃ¡sha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door
 46617	into the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffmanâs
 46618	drops.
 46619	
 46620	âAre you asleep, Mamma?â
 46621	
 46622	âOh, what sleepâ?â said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping
 46623	into a doze.
 46624	
 46625	âMamma darling!â said NatÃ¡sha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her
 46626	face close to her motherâs, âI am sorry, forgive me, Iâll never do it
 46627	again; I woke you up! MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna has sent me: they have brought
 46628	some wounded hereâofficers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere to
 46629	go. I knew youâd let them come!â she said quickly all in one breath.
 46630	
 46631	âWhat officers? Whom have they brought? I donât understand anything
 46632	about it,â said the countess.
 46633	
 46634	NatÃ¡sha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.
 46635	
 46636	âI knew youâd give permission... so Iâll tell them,â and, having kissed
 46637	her mother, NatÃ¡sha got up and went to the door.
 46638	
 46639	In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.
 46640	
 46641	âWeâve stayed too long!â said the count with involuntary vexation. âThe
 46642	Club is closed and the police are leaving.â
 46643	
 46644	âPapa, is it all rightâIâve invited some of the wounded into the house?â
 46645	said NatÃ¡sha.
 46646	
 46647	âOf course it is,â he answered absently. âThatâs not the point. I beg
 46648	you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we
 46649	must go, go, go!...â
 46650	
 46651	And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.
 46652	
 46653	At dinner PÃ©tya having returned home told them the news he had heard.
 46654	He said the people had been getting arms in the KrÃ©mlin, and that though
 46655	RostopchÃ­nâs broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three
 46656	days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone
 46657	to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big
 46658	battle there.
 46659	
 46660	The countess looked with timid horror at her sonâs eager, excited face
 46661	as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not
 46662	going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending
 46663	engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the
 46664	fatherlandâsomething senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there
 46665	would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so,
 46666	hoping to arrange to leave before then and take PÃ©tya with her as their
 46667	protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called
 46668	the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly,
 46669	that very night if possible. With a womanâs involuntary loving cunning
 46670	she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of
 46671	fright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she
 46672	was now afraid of everything.
 46673	
 46674	
 46675	
 46676	
 46677	
 46678	CHAPTER XIV
 46679	
 46680	Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the
 46681	countessâ fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit
 46682	dealerâs in MyasnÃ­tski Street. When returning by that street she had
 46683	been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of
 46684	the shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the
 46685	cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at
 46686	the drink store, having received orders to do so.
 46687	
 46688	After dinner the whole RostÃ³v household set to work with enthusiastic
 46689	haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The
 46690	old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the
 46691	house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying
 46692	people, and flurrying them still more. PÃ©tya directed things in the
 46693	yard. SÃ³nya, owing to the countâs contradictory orders, lost her head
 46694	and did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house
 46695	and yard, shouting and disputing. NatÃ¡sha, with the ardor characteristic
 46696	of all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in
 46697	the business of packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected
 46698	some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely
 46699	and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because
 46700	they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her.
 46701	Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her
 46702	authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable
 46703	Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When NatÃ¡sha set
 46704	to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full
 46705	up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much china
 46706	standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the
 46707	storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.
 46708	
 46709	âSÃ³nya, wait a bitâweâll pack everything into these,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 46710	
 46711	âYou canât, Miss, we have tried to,â said the butlerâs assistant.
 46712	
 46713	âNo, wait a minute, please.â
 46714	
 46715	And NatÃ¡sha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates
 46716	wrapped in paper.
 46717	
 46718	âThe dishes must go in here among the carpets,â said she.
 46719	
 46720	âWhy, itâs a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,â
 46721	said the butlerâs assistant.
 46722	
 46723	âOh, wait, please!â And NatÃ¡sha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the
 46724	things. âThese arenât needed,â said she, putting aside some plates
 46725	of Kiev ware. âTheseâyes, these must go among the carpets,â she said,
 46726	referring to the Saxony china dishes.
 46727	
 46728	âDonât, NatÃ¡sha! Leave it alone! Weâll get it all packed,â urged SÃ³nya
 46729	reproachfully.
 46730	
 46731	âWhat a young lady she is!â remarked the major-domo.
 46732	
 46733	But NatÃ¡sha would not give in. She turned everything out and began
 46734	quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and
 46735	unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had
 46736	been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned
 46737	out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been
 46738	rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only
 46739	the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few
 46740	more things might have been taken out, but NatÃ¡sha insisted on having
 46741	her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butlerâs assistant
 46742	and PÃ©tyaâwhom she had drawn into the business of packingâpress on the
 46743	lid, and made desperate efforts herself.
 46744	
 46745	âThatâs enough, NatÃ¡sha,â said SÃ³nya. âI see you were right, but just
 46746	take out the top one.â
 46747	
 46748	âI wonât!â cried NatÃ¡sha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung
 46749	over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the
 46750	carpets. âNow press, PÃ©tya! Press, VasÃ­lich, press hard!â she cried.
 46751	
 46752	The carpets yielded and the lid closed; NatÃ¡sha, clapping her hands,
 46753	screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only
 46754	lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her
 46755	completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that NatÃ¡sha
 46756	had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her
 46757	to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might
 46758	be corded up. Thanks to NatÃ¡shaâs directions the work now went on
 46759	expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable
 46760	packed as compactly as possible.
 46761	
 46762	But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not
 46763	get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count,
 46764	having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.
 46765	
 46766	SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha slept in the sitting room without undressing.
 46767	
 46768	That night another wounded man was driven down the PovarskÃ¡ya, and MÃ¡vra
 46769	KuzmÃ­nichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the
 46770	RostÃ³vsâ yard. MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna concluded that he was a very important
 46771	man. He was being conveyed in a calÃ¨che with a raised hood, and was
 46772	quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable
 46773	old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a
 46774	cart.
 46775	
 46776	âPlease come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house
 46777	will be empty,â said the old woman to the old attendant.
 46778	
 46779	âWell, perhaps,â said he with a sigh. âWe donât expect to get him home
 46780	alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but itâs a long way from
 46781	here, and thereâs nobody living in it.â
 46782	
 46783	âDo us the honor to come in, thereâs plenty of everything in the
 46784	masterâs house. Come in,â said MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna. âIs he very ill?â she
 46785	asked.
 46786	
 46787	The attendant made a hopeless gesture.
 46788	
 46789	âWe donât expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.â
 46790	
 46791	And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.
 46792	
 46793	âAll right!â said the doctor.
 46794	
 46795	The old servant returned to the calÃ¨che, looked into it, shook his
 46796	head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped
 46797	beside MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna.
 46798	
 46799	âO, Lord Jesus Christ!â she murmured.
 46800	
 46801	She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.
 46802	
 46803	âThe masters wonât object...â she said.
 46804	
 46805	But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him
 46806	into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schossâ.
 46807	
 46808	This wounded man was Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski.
 46809	
 46810	
 46811	
 46812	
 46813	
 46814	CHAPTER XV
 46815	
 46816	Moscowâs last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.
 46817	The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on
 46818	Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.
 46819	
 46820	Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscowâthe rabble,
 46821	that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd
 46822	of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials,
 46823	seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to
 46824	the Three Hills. Having waited there for RostopchÃ­n who did not turn
 46825	up, they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then
 46826	dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices
 46827	too that day indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of
 46828	gold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and
 46829	city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of
 46830	carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment
 46831	a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five
 46832	hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being
 46833	given away for nothing.
 46834	
 46835	In the RostÃ³vsâ staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former
 46836	conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only
 46837	indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared
 46838	during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their
 46839	possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their
 46840	estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and
 46841	they were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge
 46842	sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and
 46843	early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants
 46844	sent by wounded officers came to the RostÃ³vsâ and wounded men dragged
 46845	themselves there from the RostÃ³vsâ and from neighboring houses where
 46846	they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them
 46847	a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were
 46848	addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused,
 46849	saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these
 46850	wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one
 46851	cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and
 46852	oneâs own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded
 46853	and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and oneâs
 46854	own family. So thought the major-domo on his masterâs behalf.
 46855	
 46856	On waking up that morning Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v left his bedroom softly, so
 46857	as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning,
 46858	and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard
 46859	stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch.
 46860	The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to
 46861	a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the
 46862	major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.
 46863	
 46864	âWell, VasÃ­lich, is everything ready?â asked the count, and stroking his
 46865	bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and
 46866	nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)
 46867	
 46868	âWe can harness at once, your excellency.â
 46869	
 46870	âWell, thatâs right. As soon as the countess wakes weâll be off, God
 46871	willing! What is it, gentlemen?â he added, turning to the officer. âAre
 46872	you staying in my house?â
 46873	
 46874	The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.
 46875	
 46876	âCount, be so good as to allow me... for Godâs sake, to get into some
 46877	corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be
 46878	all right on a loaded cart....â
 46879	
 46880	Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same
 46881	request on behalf of his master.
 46882	
 46883	âOh, yes, yes, yes!â said the count hastily. âI shall be very pleased,
 46884	very pleased. VasÃ­lich, youâll see to it. Just unload one or two carts.
 46885	Well, what of it... do whatâs necessary...â said the count, muttering
 46886	some indefinite order.
 46887	
 46888	But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officerâs
 46889	face had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the
 46890	yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and
 46891	their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and
 46892	moving toward the porch.
 46893	
 46894	âPlease step into the gallery, your excellency,â said the major-domo.
 46895	âWhat are your orders about the pictures?â
 46896	
 46897	The count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to
 46898	refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.
 46899	
 46900	âWell, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,â he added in a
 46901	soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.
 46902	
 46903	At nine oâclock the countess woke up, and MatrÃ«na TimofÃ©evna, who had
 46904	been her ladyâs maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of
 46905	chief gendarmeâs duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much
 46906	offended and the young ladiesâ summer dresses could not be left behind.
 46907	On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because
 46908	her trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were
 46909	being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for
 46910	wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered
 46911	that they should take with them. The countess sent for her husband.
 46912	
 46913	âWhat is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.â
 46914	
 46915	âYou know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer
 46916	came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are
 46917	things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
 46918	them!... Really now, in our own yardâwe asked them in ourselves and
 46919	there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them
 46920	be taken... whereâs the hurry?â
 46921	
 46922	The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters.
 46923	The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of
 46924	something detrimental to the childrenâs interests, such as the building
 46925	of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater
 46926	or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced
 46927	in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.
 46928	
 46929	She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:
 46930	âListen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting
 46931	nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all ourâall the
 46932	childrenâs property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand
 46933	rublesâ worth of things in the house. I donât consent, my dear, I donât!
 46934	Do as you please! Itâs the governmentâs business to look after the
 46935	wounded; they know that. Look at the LopukhÃ­ns opposite, they cleared
 46936	out everything two days ago. Thatâs what other people do. Itâs only
 46937	we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the
 46938	children.â
 46939	
 46940	Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without
 46941	replying.
 46942	
 46943	âPapa, what are you doing that for?â asked NatÃ¡sha, who had followed him
 46944	into her motherâs room.
 46945	
 46946	âNothing! What business is it of yours?â muttered the count angrily.
 46947	
 46948	âBut I heard,â said NatÃ¡sha. âWhy does Mamma object?â
 46949	
 46950	âWhat business is it of yours?â cried the count.
 46951	
 46952	NatÃ¡sha stepped up to the window and pondered.
 46953	
 46954	âPapa! Hereâs Berg coming to see us,â said she, looking out of the
 46955	window.
 46956	
 46957	
 46958	
 46959	
 46960	
 46961	CHAPTER XVI
 46962	
 46963	Berg, the RostÃ³vsâ son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders
 46964	of VladÃ­mir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post
 46965	of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the
 46966	first division of the Second Army.
 46967	
 46968	On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.
 46969	
 46970	He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the
 46971	army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there.
 46972	So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and
 46973	domestic reasons.
 46974	
 46975	Berg drove up to his father-in-lawâs house in his spruce little trap
 46976	with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He
 46977	looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the
 46978	porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.
 46979	
 46980	From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the
 46981	drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of NatÃ¡sha
 46982	and SÃ³nya, and hastened to inquire after âMammaâsâ health.
 46983	
 46984	âHealth, at a time like this?â said the count. âCome, tell us the news!
 46985	Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?â
 46986	
 46987	âGod Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,â said
 46988	Berg. âThe army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so
 46989	to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But
 46990	in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly
 46991	antique valor of the Russian army, which theyâwhich itâ (he corrected
 46992	himself) âhas shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixthâthere
 46993	are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papaâ (he smote
 46994	himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but
 46995	Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the
 46996	words âRussian armyâ), âI tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far
 46997	from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly
 46998	restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,â he
 46999	went on rapidly. âGeneral Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at
 47000	the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a
 47001	hillside. You can imagine!â
 47002	
 47003	And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had
 47004	heard those days. NatÃ¡sha watched him with an intent gaze that confused
 47005	him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some
 47006	question.
 47007	
 47008	âAltogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors
 47009	cannot be imagined or adequately praised!â said Berg, glancing round
 47010	at NatÃ¡sha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent
 47011	look with a smile. ââRussia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of
 47012	her sons!â Isnât it so, Papa?â said he.
 47013	
 47014	Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and
 47015	dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand,
 47016	asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to
 47017	express sympathy, remained standing beside her.
 47018	
 47019	âYes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for
 47020	every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get
 47021	away....â
 47022	
 47023	âI canât think what the servants are about,â said the countess, turning
 47024	to her husband. âI have just been told that nothing is ready yet.
 47025	Somebody after all must see to things. One misses MÃ­tenka at such times.
 47026	There wonât be any end to it.â
 47027	
 47028	The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself.
 47029	He got up from his chair and went to the door.
 47030	
 47031	At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose
 47032	and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and
 47033	significantly.
 47034	
 47035	âAnd I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,â said he.
 47036	
 47037	âHm...â said the count, and stopped.
 47038	
 47039	âI was driving past YusÃºpovâs house just now,â said Berg with a laugh,
 47040	âwhen the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldnât
 47041	buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a
 47042	small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear VÃ©ra wanted a
 47043	chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.â (At the mention
 47044	of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone
 47045	to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) âAnd itâs
 47046	such a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know!
 47047	And dear VÃ©ra has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you
 47048	see. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me
 47049	have one, I will pay the man well, and...â
 47050	
 47051	The count frowned and coughed.
 47052	
 47053	âAsk the countess, I donât give orders.â
 47054	
 47055	âIf itâs inconvenient, please donât,â said Berg. âOnly I so wanted it,
 47056	for dear VÃ©raâs sake.â
 47057	
 47058	âOh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil...â
 47059	cried the old count. âMy headâs in a whirl!â
 47060	
 47061	And he left the room. The countess began to cry.
 47062	
 47063	âYes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!â said Berg.
 47064	
 47065	NatÃ¡sha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to
 47066	reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.
 47067	
 47068	PÃ©tya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants
 47069	who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the
 47070	yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing
 47071	into one of them helped by an orderly.
 47072	
 47073	âDo you know what itâs about?â PÃ©tya asked NatÃ¡sha.
 47074	
 47075	She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about.
 47076	She did not answer.
 47077	
 47078	âItâs because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded,â said
 47079	PÃ©tya. âVasÃ­lich told me. I consider...â
 47080	
 47081	âI consider,â NatÃ¡sha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to
 47082	PÃ©tya, âI consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I donât know what.
 47083	Are we despicable Germans?â
 47084	
 47085	Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and
 47086	letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed
 47087	headlong up the stairs.
 47088	
 47089	Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful
 47090	attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down
 47091	the room, when NatÃ¡sha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a
 47092	tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.
 47093	
 47094	âItâs horrid! Itâs abominable!â she screamed. âYou canât possibly have
 47095	ordered it!â
 47096	
 47097	Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count
 47098	stood still at the window and listened.
 47099	
 47100	âMamma, itâs impossible: see what is going on in the yard!â she cried.
 47101	âThey will be left!...â
 47102	
 47103	âWhatâs the matter with you? Who are âtheyâ? What do you want?â
 47104	
 47105	âWhy, the wounded! Itâs impossible, Mamma. Itâs monstrous!... No, Mamma
 47106	darling, itâs not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what
 47107	does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the
 47108	yard... Mamma!... Itâs impossible!â
 47109	
 47110	The count stood by the window and listened without turning round.
 47111	Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.
 47112	
 47113	The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her
 47114	mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn
 47115	to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.
 47116	
 47117	âOh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?â she said, not surrendering
 47118	at once.
 47119	
 47120	âMamma, darling, forgive me!â
 47121	
 47122	But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.
 47123	
 47124	âMy dear, you order what is right.... You know I donât understand about
 47125	it,â said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.
 47126	
 47127	âThe eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,â muttered the count through
 47128	tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of
 47129	shame on his breast.
 47130	
 47131	âPapa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...â asked NatÃ¡sha. âWe will still
 47132	take all the most necessary things.â
 47133	
 47134	The count nodded affirmatively, and NatÃ¡sha, at the rapid pace at which
 47135	she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the
 47136	anteroom and downstairs into the yard.
 47137	
 47138	The servants gathered round NatÃ¡sha, but could not believe the strange
 47139	order she brought them until the count himself, in his wifeâs name,
 47140	confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the
 47141	trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants
 47142	set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed
 47143	strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could
 47144	be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange
 47145	to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted
 47146	away but that had seemed the only thing to do.
 47147	
 47148	The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set
 47149	eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The
 47150	wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but
 47151	happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread
 47152	to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the
 47153	RostÃ³vsâ yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts
 47154	but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of
 47155	unloading, once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter
 47156	whether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of
 47157	china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully
 47158	packed the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on
 47159	searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and
 47160	letting the wounded have another and yet another cart.
 47161	
 47162	âWe can take four more men,â said the steward. âThey can have my trap,
 47163	or else what is to become of them?â
 47164	
 47165	âLet them have my wardrobe cart,â said the countess. âDunyÃ¡sha can go
 47166	with me in the carriage.â
 47167	
 47168	They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a
 47169	house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright
 47170	and animated. NatÃ¡sha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she
 47171	had not known for a long time.
 47172	
 47173	âWhat could we fasten this onto?â asked the servants, trying to fix a
 47174	trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. âWe must keep at least
 47175	one cart.â
 47176	
 47177	âWhatâs in it?â asked NatÃ¡sha.
 47178	
 47179	âThe countâs books.â
 47180	
 47181	âLeave it, VasÃ­lich will put it away. Itâs not wanted.â
 47182	
 47183	The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count
 47184	Peter could sit.
 47185	
 47186	âOn the box. Youâll sit on the box, wonât you, PÃ©tya?â cried NatÃ¡sha.
 47187	
 47188	SÃ³nya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite
 47189	different from NatÃ¡shaâs. She was putting away the things that had to
 47190	be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she
 47191	tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.
 47192	
 47193	
 47194	
 47195	
 47196	
 47197	CHAPTER XVII
 47198	
 47199	Before two oâclock in the afternoon the RostÃ³vsâ four carriages, packed
 47200	full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one
 47201	the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.
 47202	
 47203	The calÃ¨che in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted SÃ³nyaâs
 47204	attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was
 47205	arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at
 47206	the entrance.
 47207	
 47208	âWhose calÃ¨che is that?â she inquired, leaning out of the carriage
 47209	window.
 47210	
 47211	âWhy, didnât you know, Miss?â replied the maid. âThe wounded prince: he
 47212	spent the night in our house and is going with us.â
 47213	
 47214	âBut who is it? Whatâs his name?â
 47215	
 47216	âItâs our intended that wasâPrince BolkÃ³nski himself! They say he is
 47217	dying,â replied the maid with a sigh.
 47218	
 47219	SÃ³nya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,
 47220	tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey,
 47221	was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to
 47222	assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting.
 47223	NatÃ¡sha was not in the room.
 47224	
 47225	âMamma,â said SÃ³nya, âPrince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is
 47226	going with us.â
 47227	
 47228	The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing SÃ³nyaâs arm, glanced
 47229	around.
 47230	
 47231	âNatÃ¡sha?â she murmured.
 47232	
 47233	At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.
 47234	They knew their NatÃ¡sha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard
 47235	this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.
 47236	
 47237	âNatÃ¡sha does not know yet, but he is going with us,â said SÃ³nya.
 47238	
 47239	âYou say he is dying?â
 47240	
 47241	SÃ³nya nodded.
 47242	
 47243	The countess put her arms around SÃ³nya and began to cry.
 47244	
 47245	âThe ways of God are past finding out!â she thought, feeling that the
 47246	Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was
 47247	now taking place.
 47248	
 47249	âWell, Mamma? Everything is ready. Whatâs the matter?â asked NatÃ¡sha, as
 47250	with animated face she ran into the room.
 47251	
 47252	âNothing,â answered the countess. âIf everything is ready let us start.â
 47253	
 47254	And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. SÃ³nya
 47255	embraced NatÃ¡sha and kissed her.
 47256	
 47257	NatÃ¡sha looked at her inquiringly.
 47258	
 47259	âWhat is it? What has happened?â
 47260	
 47261	âNothing... No...â
 47262	
 47263	âIs it something very bad for me? What is it?â persisted NatÃ¡sha with
 47264	her quick intuition.
 47265	
 47266	SÃ³nya sighed and made no reply. The count, PÃ©tya, Madame Schoss, MÃ¡vra
 47267	KuzmÃ­nichna, and VasÃ­lich came into the drawing room and, having closed
 47268	the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently
 47269	seated without looking at one another.
 47270	
 47271	The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself
 47272	before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced
 47273	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna and VasÃ­lich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while
 47274	they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs
 47275	lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The
 47276	countess went into the oratory and there SÃ³nya found her on her knees
 47277	before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall.
 47278	(The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected,
 47279	were being taken with them.)
 47280	
 47281	In the porch and in the yard the men whom PÃ©tya had armed with swords
 47282	and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts
 47283	and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.
 47284	
 47285	As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in
 47286	the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on
 47287	each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the
 47288	countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house
 47289	to the carriages, the calÃ¨che, the phaeton, and back again.
 47290	
 47291	âThey always will forget everything!â said the countess. âDonât you know
 47292	I canât sit like that?â
 47293	
 47294	And DunyÃ¡sha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an
 47295	aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the
 47296	seat.
 47297	
 47298	âOh, those servants!â said the count, swaying his head.
 47299	
 47300	EfÃ­m, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to
 47301	drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance
 47302	round at what was going on behind him. From thirty yearsâ experience
 47303	he knew it would be some time yet before the order, âBe off, in Godâs
 47304	name!â would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said
 47305	he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch
 47306	something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again
 47307	be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg
 47308	him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill. He knew
 47309	all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, with more
 47310	patience than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon,
 47311	who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. At last all were
 47312	seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut,
 47313	somebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out
 47314	and said what she had to say. Then EfÃ­m deliberately doffed his hat and
 47315	began crossing himself. The postilion and all the other servants did the
 47316	same. âOff, in Godâs name!â said EfÃ­m, putting on his hat. âStart!â The
 47317	postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar,
 47318	the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman
 47319	sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out
 47320	of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted in
 47321	their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In the
 47322	carriages, the calÃ¨che, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they
 47323	passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in Moscow
 47324	walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.
 47325	
 47326	Rarely had NatÃ¡sha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in
 47327	the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding
 47328	walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the
 47329	carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of
 47330	wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see
 47331	the raised hood of Prince Andrewâs calÃ¨che. She did not know who was
 47332	in it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that
 47333	calÃ¨che. She knew it was right in front.
 47334	
 47335	In KÃºdrino, from the NikÃ­tski, PrÃ©snya, and PodnovÃ­nsk Streets came
 47336	several other trains of vehicles similar to the RostÃ³vsâ, and as they
 47337	passed along the SadÃ³vaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows
 47338	abreast.
 47339	
 47340	As they were going round the SÃºkharev water tower NatÃ¡sha, who was
 47341	inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking
 47342	past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:
 47343	
 47344	âDear me! Mamma, SÃ³nya, look, itâs he!â
 47345	
 47346	âWho? Who?â
 47347	
 47348	âLook! Yes, on my word, itâs BezÃºkhov!â said NatÃ¡sha, putting her head
 47349	out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachmanâs
 47350	long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently
 47351	a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the
 47352	SÃºkharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man
 47353	in a frieze coat.
 47354	
 47355	âYes, it really is BezÃºkhov in a coachmanâs coat, with a queer-looking
 47356	old boy. Really,â said NatÃ¡sha, âlook, look!â
 47357	
 47358	âNo, itâs not he. How can you talk such nonsense?â
 47359	
 47360	âMamma,â screamed NatÃ¡sha, âIâll stake my head itâs he! I assure you!
 47361	Stop, stop!â she cried to the coachman.
 47362	
 47363	But the coachman could not stop, for from the MeshchÃ¡nski Street came
 47364	more carts and carriages, and the RostÃ³vs were being shouted at to move
 47365	on and not block the way.
 47366	
 47367	In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the RostÃ³vs
 47368	all saw Pierreâor someone extraordinarily like himâin a coachmanâs coat,
 47369	going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small,
 47370	beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a
 47371	face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully
 47372	touching Pierreâs elbow said something to him and pointed to the
 47373	carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first
 47374	understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the
 47375	direction the old man indicated, he recognized NatÃ¡sha, and following
 47376	his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But
 47377	having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.
 47378	
 47379	NatÃ¡shaâs face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical
 47380	kindliness.
 47381	
 47382	âPeter KirÃ­lovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is
 47383	wonderful!â she cried, holding out her hand to him. âWhat are you doing?
 47384	Why are you like this?â
 47385	
 47386	Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked
 47387	along beside her while the coach still moved on.
 47388	
 47389	âWhat is the matter, Count?â asked the countess in a surprised and
 47390	commiserating tone.
 47391	
 47392	âWhat? What? Why? Donât ask me,â said Pierre, and looked round at
 47393	NatÃ¡sha whose radiant, happy expressionâof which he was conscious
 47394	without looking at herâfilled him with enchantment.
 47395	
 47396	âAre you remaining in Moscow, then?â
 47397	
 47398	Pierre hesitated.
 47399	
 47400	âIn Moscow?â he said in a questioning tone. âYes, in Moscow. Good-by!â
 47401	
 47402	âAh, if only I were a man! Iâd certainly stay with you. How splendid!â
 47403	said NatÃ¡sha. âMamma, if youâll let me, Iâll stay!â
 47404	
 47405	Pierre glanced absently at NatÃ¡sha and was about to say something, but
 47406	the countess interrupted him.
 47407	
 47408	âYou were at the battle, we heard.â
 47409	
 47410	âYes, I was,â Pierre answered. âThere will be another battle
 47411	tomorrow...â he began, but NatÃ¡sha interrupted him.
 47412	
 47413	âBut what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself....â
 47414	
 47415	âOh, donât ask me, donât ask me! I donât know myself. Tomorrow... But
 47416	no! Good-by, good-by!â he muttered. âItâs an awful time!â and dropping
 47417	behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.
 47418	
 47419	NatÃ¡sha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at
 47420	him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.
 47421	
 47422	
 47423	
 47424	
 47425	
 47426	CHAPTER XVIII
 47427	
 47428	For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living
 47429	in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, BazdÃ©ev. This is how it
 47430	happened.
 47431	
 47432	When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his
 47433	interview with Count RostopchÃ­n, he could not for some time make out
 47434	where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that
 47435	among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman
 47436	who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, he felt
 47437	suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which
 47438	he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all
 47439	was in confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or
 47440	wrong, the future held nothing, and there was no escape from this
 47441	position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat
 47442	down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door
 47443	of the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing
 47444	his arms, and took up a book. His major-domo came in a second time to
 47445	say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess
 47446	was very anxious to see him if only for a minute, and that someone from
 47447	BazdÃ©evâs widow had called to ask Pierre to take charge of her husbandâs
 47448	books, as she herself was leaving for the country.
 47449	
 47450	âOh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will
 47451	come directly,â Pierre replied to the major-domo.
 47452	
 47453	But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which
 47454	was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door.
 47455	There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this
 47456	passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with
 47457	both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was
 47458	standing at the front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there
 47459	was a second staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that
 47460	staircase and out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were
 47461	some carriages waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate
 47462	the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to
 47463	him. When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich
 47464	which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head
 47465	and quickening his pace went down the street.
 47466	
 47467	Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph
 47468	BazdÃ©evâs books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.
 47469	
 47470	He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
 47471	Patriarchâs Ponds, where the widow BazdÃ©evâs house was.
 47472	
 47473	Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were
 47474	making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky
 47475	body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre,
 47476	experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to
 47477	talk to his driver.
 47478	
 47479	The man told him that arms were being distributed today at the KrÃ©mlin
 47480	and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills
 47481	gates and a great battle would be fought there.
 47482	
 47483	Having reached the Patriarchâs Ponds Pierre found the BazdÃ©evsâ house,
 47484	where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate.
 47485	GerÃ¡sim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at TorzhÃ³k five
 47486	years before with Joseph BazdÃ©ev, came out in answer to his knock.
 47487	
 47488	âAt home?â asked Pierre.
 47489	
 47490	âOwing to the present state of things Sophia DanÃ­lovna has gone to the
 47491	TorzhÃ³k estate with the children, your excellency.â
 47492	
 47493	âI will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,â said
 47494	Pierre.
 47495	
 47496	âBe so good as to step in. MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, the brother of my late
 47497	masterâmay the kingdom of heaven be hisâhas remained here, but he is in
 47498	a weak state as you know,â said the old servant.
 47499	
 47500	Pierre knew that MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich was Joseph BazdÃ©evâs half-insane
 47501	brother and a hard drinker.
 47502	
 47503	âYes, yes, I know. Let us go in...â said Pierre and entered the house.
 47504	
 47505	A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and
 47506	with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing Pierre
 47507	he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.
 47508	
 47509	âHe was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your honor
 47510	sees,â said GerÃ¡sim. âWill you step into the study?â Pierre nodded. âAs
 47511	it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia DanÃ­lovna gave orders
 47512	that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books.â
 47513	
 47514	Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such
 47515	trepidation in his benefactorâs lifetime. The room, dusty and untouched
 47516	since the death of Joseph BazdÃ©ev was now even gloomier.
 47517	
 47518	GerÃ¡sim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre
 47519	went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts
 47520	were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important,
 47521	the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts
 47522	with BazdÃ©evâs notes and explanations. He sat down at the dusty writing
 47523	table, and, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out,
 47524	closed them, finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand
 47525	sank into meditation.
 47526	
 47527	GerÃ¡sim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre
 47528	always sitting in the same attitude.
 47529	
 47530	More than two hours passed and GerÃ¡sim took the liberty of making a
 47531	slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not
 47532	hear him.
 47533	
 47534	âIs the cabman to be discharged, your honor?â
 47535	
 47536	âOh yes!â said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. âLook
 47537	here,â he added, taking GerÃ¡sim by a button of his coat and looking down
 47538	at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, âI say, do you
 47539	know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?â
 47540	
 47541	âWe heard so,â replied the man.
 47542	
 47543	âI beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.â
 47544	
 47545	âYes, your excellency,â replied GerÃ¡sim. âWill you have something to
 47546	eat?â
 47547	
 47548	âNo, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a pistol,â
 47549	said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.
 47550	
 47551	âYes, your excellency,â said GerÃ¡sim after thinking for a moment.
 47552	
 47553	All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactorâs study,
 47554	and GerÃ¡sim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and
 47555	talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made up for him
 47556	there.
 47557	
 47558	GerÃ¡sim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things,
 47559	accepted Pierreâs taking up his residence in the house without surprise,
 47560	and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same eveningâwithout
 47561	even asking himself what they were wanted forâhe procured a coachmanâs
 47562	coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him the pistol next day.
 47563	MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes
 47564	as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But
 47565	as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around
 47566	him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. It was when
 47567	Pierre (wearing the coachmanâs coat which GerÃ¡sim had procured for him
 47568	and had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the
 47569	pistol at the SÃºkharev market that he met the RostÃ³vs.
 47570	
 47571	
 47572	
 47573	
 47574	
 47575	CHAPTER XIX
 47576	
 47577	KutÃºzovâs order to retreat through Moscow to the RyazÃ¡n road was issued
 47578	at night on the first of September.
 47579	
 47580	The first troops started at once, and during the night they marched
 47581	slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing
 47582	the town at the DorogomÃ­lov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers
 47583	crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side
 47584	and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were
 47585	bearing down on them from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm
 47586	overcame them. They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and
 47587	to the fords and the boats. KutÃºzov himself had driven round by side
 47588	streets to the other side of Moscow.
 47589	
 47590	By ten oâclock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear
 47591	guard remained in the DorogomÃ­lov suburb, where they had ample room. The
 47592	main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.
 47593	
 47594	At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,
 47595	Napoleon was standing among his troops on the PoklÃ³nny Hill looking at
 47596	the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August
 47597	to the second of September, that is from the battle of BorodinÃ³ to the
 47598	entry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating,
 47599	memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that
 47600	always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat
 47601	than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear
 47602	atmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and
 47603	refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights
 47604	are warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and
 47605	delight us continually by falling from the sky.
 47606	
 47607	At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still
 47608	held.
 47609	
 47610	The brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the PoklÃ³nny
 47611	Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her
 47612	churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas
 47613	glittering like stars in the sunlight.
 47614	
 47615	The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as
 47616	he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and
 47617	uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has
 47618	no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full force
 47619	of its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance,
 47620	distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the PoklÃ³nny
 47621	Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the
 47622	breathing of that great and beautiful body.
 47623	
 47624	Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every
 47625	foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the
 47626	mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.
 47627	
 47628	âCette ville asiatique aux innombrables Ã©glises, Moscou la sainte. La
 47629	voilÃ  donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il Ã©tait temps,â * said he, and
 47630	dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and
 47631	summoned Lelorgne dâIdeville, the interpreter.
 47632	
 47633	     * âThat Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy
 47634	     Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was
 47635	     high time.â
 47636	
 47637	
 47638	âA town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,â
 47639	thought he (he had said so to TÃºchkov at SmolÃ©nsk). From that point of
 47640	view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed
 47641	strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable,
 47642	had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at
 47643	the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance
 47644	of possessing it agitated and awed him.
 47645	
 47646	âBut could it be otherwise?â he thought. âHere is this capital at my
 47647	feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,
 47648	beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what
 47649	light must I appear to them!â thought he, thinking of his troops.
 47650	âHere she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,â he reflected,
 47651	glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and
 47652	forming up. âOne word from me, one movement of my hand, and that ancient
 47653	capital of the Tsars would perish. But my clemency is always ready to
 47654	descend upon the vanquished. I must be magnanimous and truly great. But
 47655	no, it canât be true that I am in Moscow,â he suddenly thought.
 47656	âYet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses
 47657	scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine. But I shall spare her. On
 47658	the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great
 47659	words of justice and mercy.... It is just this which Alexander will
 47660	feel most painfully, I know him.â (It seemed to Napoleon that the chief
 47661	import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between
 47662	himself and Alexander.) âFrom the height of the KrÃ©mlinâyes, there
 47663	is the KrÃ©mlin, yesâI will give them just laws; I will teach them the
 47664	meaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember
 47665	their conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not,
 47666	and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false
 47667	policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in
 47668	Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people.
 47669	I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored
 47670	monarch. âBoyars,â I will say to them, âI do not desire war, I desire
 47671	the peace and welfare of all my subjects.â However, I know their
 47672	presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do:
 47673	clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in
 47674	Moscow? Yes, there she lies.â
 47675	
 47676	âQuâon mâamÃ¨ne les boyars,â * said he to his suite.
 47677	
 47678	    * âBring the boyars to me.â
 47679	
 47680	
 47681	A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the
 47682	boyars.
 47683	
 47684	Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the
 47685	same place on the PoklÃ³nny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to
 47686	the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That
 47687	speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.
 47688	
 47689	He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to
 47690	adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies
 47691	at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would
 47692	mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the
 47693	hearts of the people. Having learned that there were many charitable
 47694	institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors
 47695	on them all. He thought that, as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose
 47696	and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars.
 47697	And in order finally to touch the hearts of the Russiansâand being like
 47698	all Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference
 47699	to ma chÃ¨re, ma tendre, ma pauvre mÃ¨re * âhe decided that he would
 47700	place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters:
 47701	âThis establishment is dedicated to my dear mother.â Or no, it should
 47702	be simply: Maison de ma MÃ¨re, *(2) he concluded. âBut am I really in
 47703	Moscow? Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the
 47704	city so long in appearing?â he wondered.
 47705	
 47706	     * âMy dear, my tender, my poor mother.â
 47707	
 47708	     * (2) âHouse of my Mother.â
 47709	
 47710	
 47711	Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers
 47712	among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite. Those sent to
 47713	fetch the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty,
 47714	that everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring
 47715	together were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact
 47716	that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact
 47717	seemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperorâwithout putting
 47718	him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculousâthat he had been
 47719	awaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left
 47720	in Moscow but no one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must
 47721	be scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that
 47722	the Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then
 47723	told the truth.
 47724	
 47725	âHe will have to be told, all the same,â said some gentlemen of the
 47726	suite. âBut, gentlemen...â
 47727	
 47728	The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon
 47729	his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the
 47730	outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under
 47731	his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.
 47732	
 47733	âBut itâs impossible...â declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging
 47734	their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied wordâle
 47735	ridicule....
 47736	
 47737	At last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actorâs instinct
 47738	suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out
 47739	was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with his hand. A single
 47740	report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already
 47741	spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into the city through the
 47742	Tver, KalÃºga, and DorogomÃ­lov gates. Faster and faster, vying with
 47743	one another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the
 47744	clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar
 47745	of mingling shouts.
 47746	
 47747	Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as
 47748	the DorogomÃ­lov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his
 47749	horse, paced for a long time by the KÃ¡mmer-KollÃ©zski rampart, awaiting
 47750	the deputation.
 47751	
 47752	
 47753	
 47754	
 47755	
 47756	CHAPTER XX
 47757	
 47758	Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a
 47759	fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty.
 47760	It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.
 47761	
 47762	In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it
 47763	seems as much alive as other hives.
 47764	
 47765	The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday
 47766	sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of
 47767	honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But one
 47768	has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any
 47769	life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the sound
 47770	that meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeperâs tap on the
 47771	wall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous
 47772	humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly
 47773	compressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an
 47774	aerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from
 47775	different parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board, instead
 47776	of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and the warm
 47777	whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling
 47778	with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels sounding the
 47779	alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense of the
 47780	hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity,
 47781	like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of
 47782	disorder. In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with
 47783	honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do not sting, but crawl away from
 47784	danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they
 47785	flew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower
 47786	part of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy beesâtamed by
 47787	toil, clinging to one anotherâs legs and drawing out the wax, with a
 47788	ceaseless hum of laborâthat used to hang in long clusters down to the
 47789	floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in
 47790	various directions on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a
 47791	neatly glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings,
 47792	there is a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees
 47793	scarcely moving their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared
 47794	away.
 47795	
 47796	The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super.
 47797	Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and
 47798	keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the
 47799	combs, but no longer in their former state of purity. All is neglected
 47800	and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about
 47801	the combs, and the short home bees, shriveled and listless as if they
 47802	were old, creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers,
 47803	having lost all motive and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps,
 47804	and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their
 47805	flight. Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey
 47806	an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of
 47807	bees, by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with
 47808	efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or
 47809	bumblebee without knowing why they do it. In another corner two old bees
 47810	are languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another,
 47811	without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile
 47812	intent. In a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack
 47813	some victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or
 47814	killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap
 47815	of corpses. The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine
 47816	the brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by
 47817	thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery
 47818	of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of
 47819	bees. They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they
 47820	had guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only
 47821	a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemyâs
 47822	hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall
 47823	as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark
 47824	on it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean.
 47825	
 47826	So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and
 47827	morose, paced up and down in front of the KÃ¡mmer-KollÃ©zski rampart,
 47828	awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of
 47829	the proprietiesâa deputation.
 47830	
 47831	In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly
 47832	moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they
 47833	were doing.
 47834	
 47835	When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was
 47836	empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently
 47837	continued to walk to and fro.
 47838	
 47839	âMy carriage!â he said.
 47840	
 47841	He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the
 47842	suburb. âMoscow deserted!â he said to himself. âWhat an incredible
 47843	event!â
 47844	
 47845	He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the DorogomÃ­lov
 47846	suburb.
 47847	
 47848	The coup de thÃ©Ã¢tre had not come off.
 47849	
 47850	
 47851	
 47852	
 47853	
 47854	CHAPTER XXI
 47855	
 47856	The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two oâclock at night
 47857	till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the
 47858	last of the inhabitants who were leaving.
 47859	
 47860	The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the
 47861	Stone, MoskvÃ¡, and YaÃºza bridges.
 47862	
 47863	While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the
 47864	KrÃ©mlin, were thronging the MoskvÃ¡ and the Stone bridges, a great many
 47865	soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back
 47866	from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of
 47867	VasÃ­li the Beatified and under the BorovÃ­tski gate, back up the hill
 47868	to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take
 47869	things not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales
 47870	filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were no
 47871	dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to
 47872	enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of female
 47873	purchasersâbut only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though without
 47874	muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way
 47875	out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants
 47876	(of whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite
 47877	bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, and
 47878	themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants. On the
 47879	square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call.
 47880	But the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the
 47881	direction of the drum as formerly, but made them, on the contrary, run
 47882	farther away. Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were
 47883	to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads. Two officers, one
 47884	with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse,
 47885	the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of IlyÃ­nka
 47886	Street, talking. A third officer galloped up to them.
 47887	
 47888	âThe general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.
 47889	This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.â
 47890	
 47891	âWhere are you off to?... Where?...â he shouted to three infantrymen
 47892	without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were
 47893	slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. âStop, you rascals!â
 47894	
 47895	âBut how are you going to stop them?â replied another officer. âThere is
 47896	no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt,
 47897	thatâs all!â
 47898	
 47899	âHow can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge, and
 47900	donât move. Shouldnât we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from
 47901	running away?â
 47902	
 47903	âCome, go in there and drive them out!â shouted the senior officer.
 47904	
 47905	The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with
 47906	him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A
 47907	shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm,
 47908	persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and
 47909	ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.
 47910	
 47911	âYour honor!â said he. âBe so good as to protect us! We wonât grudge
 47912	trifles, you are welcome to anythingâwe shall be delighted! Pray!...
 47913	Iâll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman,
 47914	or even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is; but whatâs all
 47915	thisâsheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be placed if only to
 47916	let us close the shop....â
 47917	
 47918	Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.
 47919	
 47920	âEh, what twaddle!â said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man. âWhen
 47921	oneâs head is gone one doesnât weep for oneâs hair! Take what any of you
 47922	like!â And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the
 47923	officer.
 47924	
 47925	âItâs all very well for you, IvÃ¡n SidÃ³rych, to talk,â said the first
 47926	tradesman angrily. âPlease step inside, your honor!â
 47927	
 47928	âTalk indeed!â cried the thin one. âIn my three shops here I have a
 47929	hundred thousand rublesâ worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army
 47930	has gone? Eh, what people! âAgainst Godâs might our hands canât fight.ââ
 47931	
 47932	âCome inside, your honor!â repeated the tradesman, bowing.
 47933	
 47934	The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.
 47935	
 47936	âItâs not my business!â he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of
 47937	the passages.
 47938	
 47939	From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just
 47940	as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was
 47941	flung out violently.
 47942	
 47943	This man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. The
 47944	officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that
 47945	moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the MoskvÃ¡
 47946	bridge and the officer ran out into the square.
 47947	
 47948	âWhat is it? What is it?â he asked, but his comrade was already
 47949	galloping off past VasÃ­li the Beatified in the direction from which the
 47950	screams came.
 47951	
 47952	The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the
 47953	bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge,
 47954	several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the
 47955	troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were
 47956	harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.
 47957	The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a childâs chair
 47958	with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and
 47959	desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers that the screams
 47960	of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that
 47961	General ErmÃ³lov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were
 47962	dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge,
 47963	had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the
 47964	bridge. The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting
 47965	and squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops
 47966	were now moving forward.
 47967	
 47968	
 47969	
 47970	
 47971	
 47972	CHAPTER XXII
 47973	
 47974	Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the
 47975	streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round
 47976	the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody
 47977	drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The
 47978	PovarskÃ¡ya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard of the
 47979	RostÃ³vsâ house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the
 47980	horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great drawing
 47981	room of the house, which had been left with all it contained, were
 47982	two people. They were the yard porter IgnÃ¡t, and the page boy MÃ­shka,
 47983	VasÃ­lichâs grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather.
 47984	MÃ­shka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with
 47985	one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with
 47986	satisfaction before the large mirror.
 47987	
 47988	âIsnât it fine, eh, Uncle IgnÃ¡t?â said the boy, suddenly beginning to
 47989	strike the keyboard with both hands.
 47990	
 47991	âOnly fancy!â answered IgnÃ¡t, surprised at the broadening grin on his
 47992	face in the mirror.
 47993	
 47994	âImpudence! Impudence!â they heard behind them the voice of MÃ¡vra
 47995	KuzmÃ­nichna who had entered silently. âHow heâs grinning, the fat mug!
 47996	Is that what youâre here for? Nothingâs cleared away down there and
 47997	VasÃ­lich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!â
 47998	
 47999	IgnÃ¡t left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the room with
 48000	meekly downcast eyes.
 48001	
 48002	âAunt, I did it gently,â said the boy.
 48003	
 48004	âIâll give you something gently, you monkey you!â cried MÃ¡vra
 48005	KuzmÃ­nichna, raising her arm threateningly. âGo and get the samovar to
 48006	boil for your grandfather.â
 48007	
 48008	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and
 48009	with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.
 48010	
 48011	Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go
 48012	nextâto drink tea in the servantsâ wing with VasÃ­lich, or into the
 48013	storeroom to put away what still lay about.
 48014	
 48015	She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone
 48016	stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.
 48017	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna went to the gate.
 48018	
 48019	âWho do you want?â
 48020	
 48021	âThe countâCount IlyÃ¡ AndrÃ©evich RostÃ³v.â
 48022	
 48023	âAnd who are you?â
 48024	
 48025	âAn officer, I have to see him,â came the reply in a pleasant, well-bred
 48026	Russian voice.
 48027	
 48028	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with the
 48029	round face of a RostÃ³v, entered the yard.
 48030	
 48031	âThey have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,â said
 48032	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna cordially.
 48033	
 48034	The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to
 48035	enter or not, clicked his tongue.
 48036	
 48037	âAh, how annoying!â he muttered. âI should have come yesterday.... Ah,
 48038	what a pity.â
 48039	
 48040	Meanwhile, MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna was attentively and sympathetically
 48041	examining the familiar RostÃ³v features of the young manâs face, his
 48042	tattered coat and trodden-down boots.
 48043	
 48044	âWhat did you want to see the count for?â she asked.
 48045	
 48046	âOh well... it canât be helped!â said he in a tone of vexation and
 48047	placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.
 48048	
 48049	He again paused in indecision.
 48050	
 48051	âYou see,â he suddenly said, âI am a kinsman of the countâs and he has
 48052	been very kind to me. As you seeâ (he glanced with an amused air and
 48053	good-natured smile at his coat and boots) âmy things are worn out and I
 48054	have no money, so I was going to ask the count...â
 48055	
 48056	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna did not let him finish.
 48057	
 48058	âJust wait a minute, sir. One little moment,â said she.
 48059	
 48060	And as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,
 48061	hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the
 48062	servantsâ quarters.
 48063	
 48064	While MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna was running to her room the officer walked about
 48065	the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint
 48066	smile on his lips. âWhat a pity Iâve missed Uncle! What a nice old
 48067	woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way
 48068	to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near the RogÃ³zhski
 48069	gate?â thought he. Just then MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna appeared from behind
 48070	the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a
 48071	rolled-up check kerchief in her hand. While still a few steps from
 48072	the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white
 48073	twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him.
 48074	
 48075	âIf his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of course...
 48076	but as it is...â
 48077	
 48078	MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not
 48079	decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.
 48080	
 48081	âIf the count had been at home...â MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna went on
 48082	apologetically. âChrist be with you, sir! May God preserve you!â said
 48083	she, bowing as she saw him out.
 48084	
 48085	Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran
 48086	almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the YaÃºza bridge to
 48087	overtake his regiment.
 48088	
 48089	But MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist
 48090	eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of
 48091	motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.
 48092

 48097	CHAPTER XXIII
 48098	
 48099	From an unfinished house on the VarvÃ¡rka, the ground floor of which was
 48100	a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches round the tables
 48101	in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring,
 48102	with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously singing
 48103	some song or other. They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with
 48104	great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because
 48105	they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall,
 48106	fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His
 48107	face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not
 48108	been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed
 48109	eyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were
 48110	singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white
 48111	arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread
 48112	out his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he
 48113	always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were
 48114	most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be
 48115	bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows
 48116	in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his arm.
 48117	
 48118	âStop it!â he exclaimed peremptorily. âThereâs a fight, lads!â And,
 48119	still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.
 48120	
 48121	The factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership of
 48122	the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had brought the
 48123	publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served
 48124	them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, hearing the sounds of
 48125	revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into, wished
 48126	to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted.
 48127	
 48128	The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when the
 48129	workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern
 48130	keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.
 48131	
 48132	Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican
 48133	with his chest.
 48134	
 48135	The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and
 48136	cried wildly: âTheyâre fighting us, lads!â
 48137	
 48138	At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised
 48139	face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: âPolice! Murder!...
 48140	Theyâve killed a man, lads!â
 48141	
 48142	âOh, gracious me, a man beaten to deathâkilled!...â screamed a woman
 48143	coming out of a gate close by.
 48144	
 48145	A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.
 48146	
 48147	âHavenât you robbed people enoughâtaking their last shirts?â said a
 48148	voice addressing the publican. âWhat have you killed a man for, you
 48149	thief?â
 48150	
 48151	The tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from the
 48152	publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to
 48153	fight now.
 48154	
 48155	âMurderer!â he shouted suddenly to the publican. âBind him, lads!â
 48156	
 48157	âI daresay you would like to bind me!â shouted the publican, pushing
 48158	away the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head he
 48159	flung it on the ground.
 48160	
 48161	As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the
 48162	workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.
 48163	
 48164	âI know the law very well, mates! Iâll take the matter to the captain
 48165	of police. You think I wonât get to him? Robbery is not permitted to
 48166	anybody nowadays!â shouted the publican, picking up his cap.
 48167	
 48168	âCome along then! Come along then!â the publican and the tall young
 48169	fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the street
 48170	together.
 48171	
 48172	The bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and others
 48173	followed behind, talking and shouting.
 48174	
 48175	At the corner of the MorosÃ©yka, opposite a large house with closed
 48176	shutters and bearing a bootmakerâs signboard, stood a score of thin,
 48177	worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered
 48178	coats.
 48179	
 48180	âHe should pay folks off properly,â a thin workingman, with frowning
 48181	brows and a straggly beard, was saying.
 48182	
 48183	âBut heâs sucked our blood and now he thinks heâs quit of us. Heâs been
 48184	misleading us all the week and now that heâs brought us to this pass
 48185	heâs made off.â
 48186	
 48187	On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased
 48188	speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving
 48189	crowd.
 48190	
 48191	âWhere are all the folks going?â
 48192	
 48193	âWhy, to the police, of course!â
 48194	
 48195	âI say, is it true that we have been beaten?â âAnd what did you think?
 48196	Look what folks are saying.â
 48197	
 48198	Questions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage of the
 48199	increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.
 48200	
 48201	The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his
 48202	bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention
 48203	to himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting
 48204	answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.
 48205	
 48206	âHe must keep order, keep the law, thatâs what the government is there
 48207	for. Am I not right, good Christians?â said the tall youth, with a
 48208	scarcely perceptible smile. âHe thinks thereâs no government! How can
 48209	one do without government? Or else there would be plenty whoâd rob us.â
 48210	
 48211	âWhy talk nonsense?â rejoined voices in the crowd. âWill they give
 48212	up Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it!
 48213	Arenât there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed! Thatâs
 48214	what the government is for. Youâd better listen to what people are
 48215	saying,â said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.
 48216	
 48217	By the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered round
 48218	a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.
 48219	
 48220	âAn ukÃ¡se, they are reading an ukÃ¡se! Reading an ukÃ¡se!â cried voices in
 48221	the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.
 48222	
 48223	The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31. When
 48224	the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand
 48225	of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather
 48226	tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.
 48227	
 48228	âEarly tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,â he read (âSirin
 48229	Highness,â said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and
 48230	a frown on his brow), âto consult with him to act, and to aid the army
 48231	to exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part...â the reader
 48232	went on, and then paused (âDo you see,â shouted the youth victoriously,
 48233	âheâs going to clear up the whole affair for you....â), âin destroying
 48234	them, and will send these visitors to the devil. I will come back to
 48235	dinner, and weâll set to work. We will do, completely do, and undo these
 48236	scoundrels.â
 48237	
 48238	The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The tall
 48239	lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood
 48240	the last part. In particular, the words âI will come back to dinner,â
 48241	evidently displeased both reader and audience. The peopleâs minds
 48242	were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly
 48243	comprehensibleâit was what any one of them might have said and therefore
 48244	was what an ukÃ¡se emanating from the highest authority should not say.
 48245	
 48246	They all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his lips and
 48247	swayed from side to side.
 48248	
 48249	âWe should ask him... thatâs he himself?â... âYes, ask him indeed!...
 48250	Why not? Heâll explainâ... voices in the rear of the crowd were
 48251	suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned to the police
 48252	superintendentâs trap which drove into the square attended by two
 48253	mounted dragoons.
 48254	
 48255	The superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count
 48256	RostopchÃ­nâs orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that
 48257	matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his
 48258	pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to
 48259	stop.
 48260	
 48261	âWhat people are these?â he shouted to the men, who were moving singly
 48262	and timidly in the direction of his trap.
 48263	
 48264	âWhat people are these?â he shouted again, receiving no answer.
 48265	
 48266	âYour honor...â replied the shopman in the frieze coat, âyour honor, in
 48267	accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they
 48268	desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of
 48269	riot, but as his highest excellence said...â
 48270	
 48271	âThe count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued
 48272	concerning you,â said the superintendent of police. âGo on!â he ordered
 48273	his coachman.
 48274	
 48275	The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the
 48276	superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.
 48277	
 48278	The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared
 48279	look, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their
 48280	speed.
 48281	
 48282	âItâs a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!â shouted the tall
 48283	youth. âDonât let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!â shouted
 48284	different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.
 48285	
 48286	Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went
 48287	in the direction of the LubyÃ¡nka Street.
 48288	
 48289	âThere now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to
 48290	perish. Do they think weâre dogs?â voices in the crowd were heard saying
 48291	more and more frequently.
 48292	
 48293	
 48294	
 48295	
 48296	
 48297	CHAPTER XXIV
 48298	
 48299	On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with
 48300	KutÃºzov, Count RostopchÃ­n had returned to Moscow mortified and offended
 48301	because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and
 48302	because KutÃºzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the
 48303	defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him
 48304	at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its
 48305	patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and
 48306	unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this,
 48307	RostopchÃ­n had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa
 48308	without undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier
 48309	bringing him a letter from KutÃºzov. This letter requested the count to
 48310	send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army
 48311	was retreating to the RyazÃ¡n road beyond Moscow. This was not news to
 48312	RostopchÃ­n. He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since
 48313	his interview the previous day with KutÃºzov on the PoklÃ³nny Hill but
 48314	ever since the battle of BorodinÃ³, for all the generals who came to
 48315	Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to
 48316	fight another battle, and since then the government property had been
 48317	removed every night, and half the inhabitants had left the city
 48318	with RostopchÃ­nâs own permission. Yet all the same this information
 48319	astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in the form of a
 48320	simple note with an order from KutÃºzov, and received at night, breaking
 48321	in on his beauty sleep.
 48322	
 48323	When later on in his memoirs Count RostopchÃ­n explained his actions at
 48324	this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important
 48325	considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the
 48326	departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all
 48327	RostopchÃ­nâs actions appear irreproachable. âWhy were the holy relics,
 48328	the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why
 48329	were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would
 48330	not be given upâand thereby ruined?â âTo preserve the tranquillity
 48331	of the city,â explains Count RostopchÃ­n. âWhy were bundles of useless
 48332	papers from the government offices, and Leppichâs balloon and other
 48333	articles removed?â âTo leave the town empty,â explains Count RostopchÃ­n.
 48334	One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action
 48335	finds a justification.
 48336	
 48337	All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for
 48338	public tranquillity.
 48339	
 48340	On what, then, was Count RostopchÃ­nâs fear for the tranquillity of
 48341	Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability
 48342	of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the
 48343	retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to
 48344	riot?
 48345	
 48346	Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an
 48347	insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than
 48348	ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of
 48349	September, and except for a mob in the governorâs courtyard, assembled
 48350	there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would
 48351	have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people
 48352	if after the battle of BorodinÃ³, when the surrender of Moscow became
 48353	certain or at least probable, RostopchÃ­n instead of exciting the people
 48354	by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all
 48355	the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the
 48356	population plainly that the town would be abandoned.
 48357	
 48358	RostopchÃ­n, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and
 48359	impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles
 48360	and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to
 48361	be guiding. Ever since the enemyâs entry into SmolÃ©nsk he had in
 48362	imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling
 48363	of âthe heart of Russia.â Not only did it seem to him (as to all
 48364	administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscowâs
 48365	inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by
 48366	means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the
 48367	people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in
 48368	authority. RostopchÃ­n was so pleased with the fine role of leader of
 48369	popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of
 48370	relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display
 48371	took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under
 48372	his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew
 48373	it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe
 48374	that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The
 48375	inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were
 48376	removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count
 48377	yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created
 48378	for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent
 48379	imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he
 48380	knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and
 48381	did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.
 48382	
 48383	All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful
 48384	and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply
 48385	directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic
 48386	hatred of the French.
 48387	
 48388	But when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing
 48389	hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not
 48390	even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when
 48391	self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before
 48392	Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man,
 48393	abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all
 48394	the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by RostopchÃ­n
 48395	suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous,
 48396	weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.
 48397	
 48398	When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note
 48399	from KutÃºzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself
 48400	to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state
 48401	property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no
 48402	longer possible to take the whole of it away.
 48403	
 48404	âWho is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?â he
 48405	ruminated. âNot I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow
 48406	firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!
 48407	Traitors!â he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and
 48408	traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever
 48409	they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in
 48410	which he found himself.
 48411	
 48412	All that night Count RostopchÃ­n issued orders, for which people came to
 48413	him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the count
 48414	so morose and irritable.
 48415	
 48416	âYour excellency, the Director of the Registrarâs Department has sent
 48417	for instructions.... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the
 48418	University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent...
 48419	asking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade?
 48420	From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of the
 48421	lunatic asylum...â All night long such announcements were continually
 48422	being received by the count.
 48423	
 48424	To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that
 48425	orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully
 48426	prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody
 48427	would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.
 48428	
 48429	âOh, tell that blockhead,â he said in reply to the question from the
 48430	Registrarâs Department, âthat he should remain to guard his documents.
 48431	Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have
 48432	horses, let them be off to VladÃ­mir, and not leave them to the French.â
 48433	
 48434	âYour excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:
 48435	what are your commands?â
 48436	
 48437	âMy commands? Let them go away, thatâs all.... And let the lunatics
 48438	out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means
 48439	these other madmen to be free.â
 48440	
 48441	In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count
 48442	RostopchÃ­n shouted angrily at the governor:
 48443	
 48444	âDo you expect me to give you two battalionsâwhich we have not gotâfor a
 48445	convoy? Release them, thatâs all about it!â
 48446	
 48447	âYour excellency, there are some political prisoners, MeshkÃ³v,
 48448	VereshchÃ¡gin...â
 48449	
 48450	âVereshchÃ¡gin! Hasnât he been hanged yet?â shouted RostopchÃ­n. âBring
 48451	him to me!â
 48452	
 48453	
 48454	
 48455	
 48456	
 48457	CHAPTER XXV
 48458	
 48459	Toward nine oâclock in the morning, when the troops were already moving
 48460	through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions.
 48461	Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord, those
 48462	who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do.
 48463	
 48464	The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to SokÃ³lniki, and sat
 48465	in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.
 48466	
 48467	In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it
 48468	is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is
 48469	kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every
 48470	administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the
 48471	sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark,
 48472	holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself
 48473	moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding
 48474	on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and
 48475	the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves
 48476	independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer
 48477	reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead
 48478	of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant,
 48479	useless, feeble man.
 48480	
 48481	RostopchÃ­n felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.
 48482	
 48483	The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to
 48484	see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the
 48485	horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of
 48486	police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had
 48487	received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the
 48488	courtyard and wished to see him.
 48489	
 48490	Without saying a word RostopchÃ­n rose and walked hastily to his light,
 48491	luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the
 48492	handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a
 48493	better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front,
 48494	flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The
 48495	blood-stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of
 48496	voices was audible through the closed window.
 48497	
 48498	âIs my carriage ready?â asked RostopchÃ­n, stepping back from the window.
 48499	
 48500	âIt is, your excellency,â replied the adjutant.
 48501	
 48502	RostopchÃ­n went again to the balcony door.
 48503	
 48504	âBut what do they want?â he asked the superintendent of police.
 48505	
 48506	âYour excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your
 48507	orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about
 48508	treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellencyâI hardly managed
 48509	to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...â
 48510	
 48511	âYou may go. I donât need you to tell me what to do!â exclaimed
 48512	RostopchÃ­n angrily.
 48513	
 48514	He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.
 48515	
 48516	âThis is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done
 48517	with me!â thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up
 48518	within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be
 48519	attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by
 48520	anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it. âHere is
 48521	that mob, the dregs of the people,â he thought as he gazed at the crowd:
 48522	âthis rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,â
 48523	he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this
 48524	thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim,
 48525	something on which to vent his rage.
 48526	
 48527	âIs the carriage ready?â he asked again.
 48528	
 48529	âYes, your excellency. What are your orders about VereshchÃ¡gin? He is
 48530	waiting at the porch,â said the adjutant.
 48531	
 48532	âAh!â exclaimed RostopchÃ­n, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.
 48533	
 48534	And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony.
 48535	The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes
 48536	were raised to the count.
 48537	
 48538	âGood morning, lads!â said the count briskly and loudly. âThank you for
 48539	coming. Iâll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle
 48540	with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of
 48541	Moscow. Wait for me!â
 48542	
 48543	And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door
 48544	behind him.
 48545	
 48546	A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. âHeâll
 48547	settle with all the villains, youâll see! And you said the French...
 48548	Heâll show you what law is!â the mob were saying as if reproving one
 48549	another for their lack of confidence.
 48550	
 48551	A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,
 48552	gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved
 48553	eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. RostopchÃ­n, coming out there
 48554	with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.
 48555	
 48556	âWhere is he?â he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man coming
 48557	round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin
 48558	neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by
 48559	short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat
 48560	lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict
 48561	trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots.
 48562	On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute
 48563	movements.
 48564	
 48565	âAh!â said RostopchÃ­n, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young
 48566	man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch.
 48567	âPut him there.â
 48568	
 48569	The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot
 48570	indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed
 48571	his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and
 48572	submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.
 48573	
 48574	For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step
 48575	the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were
 48576	all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling
 48577	of feet be heard.
 48578	
 48579	While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step RostopchÃ­n
 48580	stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.
 48581	
 48582	âLads!â said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. âThis man,
 48583	VereshchÃ¡gin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.â
 48584	
 48585	The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a
 48586	submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young
 48587	face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At
 48588	the countâs first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if
 48589	wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But RostopchÃ­n did
 48590	not look at him. A vein in the young manâs long thin neck swelled like a
 48591	cord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.
 48592	
 48593	All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more
 48594	hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly
 48595	and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.
 48596	
 48597	âHe has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to
 48598	Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name,
 48599	he has caused Moscow to perish,â said RostopchÃ­n in a sharp, even voice,
 48600	but suddenly he glanced down at VereshchÃ¡gin who continued to stand in
 48601	the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his
 48602	arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:
 48603	
 48604	âDeal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.â
 48605	
 48606	The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to
 48607	one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling
 48608	atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,
 48609	uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing
 48610	in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place before them, all
 48611	stood with wide-open eyes and mouths, straining with all their strength,
 48612	and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them.
 48613	
 48614	âBeat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!â
 48615	shouted RostopchÃ­n. âCut him down. I command it.â
 48616	
 48617	Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of RostopchÃ­nâs voice,
 48618	the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.
 48619	
 48620	âCount!â exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of VereshchÃ¡gin in the
 48621	midst of the momentary silence that ensued, âCount! One God is above us
 48622	both....â He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck
 48623	filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.
 48624	
 48625	He did not finish what he wished to say.
 48626	
 48627	âCut him down! I command it...â shouted RostopchÃ­n, suddenly growing
 48628	pale like VereshchÃ¡gin.
 48629	
 48630	âDraw sabers!â cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.
 48631	
 48632	Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the
 48633	front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall
 48634	youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood
 48635	beside VereshchÃ¡gin.
 48636	
 48637	âSaber him!â the dragoon officer almost whispered.
 48638	
 48639	And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,
 48640	struck VereshchÃ¡gin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.
 48641	
 48642	âAh!â cried VereshchÃ¡gin in meek surprise, looking round with a
 48643	frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A
 48644	similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. âO Lord!â
 48645	exclaimed a sorrowful voice.
 48646	
 48647	But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from VereshchÃ¡gin
 48648	he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier
 48649	of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in
 48650	check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The
 48651	plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar
 48652	of the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that
 48653	last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks,
 48654	carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was
 48655	about to repeat his blow. VereshchÃ¡gin with a cry of horror, covering
 48656	his head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth,
 48657	against whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and,
 48658	yelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing, struggling
 48659	crowd.
 48660	
 48661	Some beat and tore at VereshchÃ¡gin, others at the tall youth. And the
 48662	screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to
 48663	rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long
 48664	time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten
 48665	almost to death. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with
 48666	which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were
 48667	hitting, throttling, and tearing at VereshchÃ¡gin were unable to kill
 48668	him, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them
 48669	in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or
 48670	let him go.
 48671	
 48672	âHit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ....
 48673	Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief
 48674	right. Use the hatchet!... Whatâstill alive?â
 48675	
 48676	Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a
 48677	long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate,
 48678	bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one came
 48679	up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and
 48680	astonishment pushed back again.
 48681	
 48682	âO Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?â voices
 48683	in the crowd could be heard saying. âQuite a young fellow too... must
 48684	have been a merchantâs son. What men!... and they say heâs not the right
 48685	one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And thereâs another has been
 48686	beaten tooâthey say heâs nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Arenât
 48687	they afraid of sinning?...â said the same mob now, looking with pained
 48688	distress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its
 48689	livid face stained with blood and dust.
 48690	
 48691	A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in
 48692	his excellencyâs courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away.
 48693	Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the
 48694	ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck
 48695	trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.
 48696	
 48697	At the moment when VereshchÃ¡gin fell and the crowd closed in with savage
 48698	yells and swayed about him, RostopchÃ­n suddenly turned pale and, instead
 48699	of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went
 48700	with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the
 48701	passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The countâs face was
 48702	white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.
 48703	
 48704	âThis way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,
 48705	please...â said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.
 48706	
 48707	Count RostopchÃ­n was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in
 48708	the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his calÃ¨che. The
 48709	distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily
 48710	took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in
 48711	SokÃ³lniki.
 48712	
 48713	When they reached the MyasnÃ­tski Street and could no longer hear
 48714	the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with
 48715	dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his
 48716	subordinates. âThe mob is terribleâdisgusting,â he said to himself
 48717	in French. âThey are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.â
 48718	âCount! One God is above us both!ââVereshchÃ¡ginâs words suddenly
 48719	recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this
 48720	was only a momentary feeling and Count RostopchÃ­n smiled disdainfully
 48721	at himself. âI had other duties,â thought he. âThe people had to be
 48722	appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the
 48723	public goodââand he began thinking of his social duties to his family
 48724	and to the city entrusted to him, and of himselfânot himself as Theodore
 48725	VasÃ­lyevich RostopchÃ­n (he fancied that Theodore VasÃ­lyevich RostopchÃ­n
 48726	was sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor,
 48727	the representative of authority and of the Tsar. âHad I been simply
 48728	Theodore VasÃ­lyevich my course of action would have been quite
 48729	different, but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as
 48730	commander in chief.â
 48731	
 48732	Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer
 48733	hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, RostopchÃ­n grew physically
 48734	calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil
 48735	his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The
 48736	thought which tranquillized RostopchÃ­n was not a new one. Since the
 48737	world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed
 48738	such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with
 48739	this same idea. This idea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of
 48740	other people.
 48741	
 48742	To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he
 48743	who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And
 48744	RostopchÃ­n now knew it.
 48745	
 48746	Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but
 48747	he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully
 48748	contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a
 48749	criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.
 48750	
 48751	âVereshchÃ¡gin was tried and condemned to death,â thought RostopchÃ­n
 48752	(though the Senate had only condemned VereshchÃ¡gin to hard labor), âhe
 48753	was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have
 48754	killed two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim
 48755	and at the same time punished a miscreant.â
 48756	
 48757	Having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic
 48758	arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.
 48759	
 48760	Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the
 48761	SokÃ³lniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering
 48762	what was to come. He was driving to the YaÃºza bridge where he had heard
 48763	that KutÃºzov was. Count RostopchÃ­n was mentally preparing the angry and
 48764	stinging reproaches he meant to address to KutÃºzov for his deception. He
 48765	would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all
 48766	the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the
 48767	ruin of Russia (as RostopchÃ­n regarded it) would fall upon his doting
 48768	old head. Planning beforehand what he would say to KutÃºzov, RostopchÃ­n
 48769	turned angrily in his calÃ¨che and gazed sternly from side to side.
 48770	
 48771	The SokÃ³lniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the
 48772	almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white
 48773	and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and
 48774	gesticulating.
 48775	
 48776	One of these was running to cross the path of Count RostopchÃ­nâs
 48777	carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons
 48778	looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and
 48779	especially at the one running toward them.
 48780	
 48781	Swaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering
 48782	dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on
 48783	RostopchÃ­n, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him
 48784	to stop. The lunaticâs solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow, with
 48785	its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with
 48786	saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.
 48787	
 48788	âStop! Pull up, I tell you!â he cried in a piercing voice, and again
 48789	shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.
 48790	
 48791	Coming abreast of the calÃ¨che he ran beside it.
 48792	
 48793	âThrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead. They
 48794	stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall rise.
 48795	They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown... Thrice
 48796	will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!â he cried, raising his
 48797	voice higher and higher.
 48798	
 48799	Count RostopchÃ­n suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed
 48800	in on VereshchÃ¡gin. He turned away. âGo fas... faster!â he cried in a
 48801	trembling voice to his coachman. The calÃ¨che flew over the ground as
 48802	fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count RostopchÃ­n
 48803	still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the
 48804	distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened,
 48805	bloodstained face of âthe traitorâ in the fur-lined coat.
 48806	
 48807	Recent as that mental picture was, RostopchÃ­n already felt that it had
 48808	cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that
 48809	the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that
 48810	the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more
 48811	cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear
 48812	the sound of his own words: âCut him down! I command it....â
 48813	
 48814	âWhy did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them....
 48815	I need not have said them,â he thought. âAnd then nothing would have
 48816	happened.â He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon
 48817	who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the
 48818	fur-lined coat had turned upon him. âBut I did not do it for my own
 48819	sake. I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public
 48820	welfare,â thought he.
 48821	
 48822	Troops were still crowding at the YaÃºza bridge. It was hot. KutÃºzov,
 48823	dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his
 48824	whip in the sand when a calÃ¨che dashed up noisily. A man in a generalâs
 48825	uniform with plumes in his hat went up to KutÃºzov and said something
 48826	in French. It was Count RostopchÃ­n. He told KutÃºzov that he had come
 48827	because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army remained.
 48828	
 48829	âThings would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told
 48830	me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this
 48831	would not have happened,â he said.
 48832	
 48833	KutÃºzov looked at RostopchÃ­n as if, not grasping what was said to him,
 48834	he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the
 48835	face of the man addressing him. RostopchÃ­n grew confused and became
 48836	silent. KutÃºzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating
 48837	gaze from RostopchÃ­nâs face muttered softly:
 48838	
 48839	âNo! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!â
 48840	
 48841	Whether KutÃºzov was thinking of something entirely different when
 48842	he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be
 48843	meaningless, at any rate RostopchÃ­n made no reply and hastily left him.
 48844	And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count RostopchÃ­n,
 48845	took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts
 48846	to drive on the carts that blocked the way.
 48847	
 48848	
 48849	
 48850	
 48851	
 48852	CHAPTER XXVI
 48853	
 48854	Toward four oâclock in the afternoon Muratâs troops were entering
 48855	Moscow. In front rode a detachment of WÃ¼rttemberg hussars and behind
 48856	them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.
 48857	
 48858	About the middle of the ArbÃ¡t Street, near the Church of the Miraculous
 48859	Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced
 48860	detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le
 48861	Kremlin.
 48862	
 48863	Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow. They
 48864	all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired commander
 48865	dressed up in feathers and gold.
 48866	
 48867	âIs that their Tsar himself? Heâs not bad!â low voices could be heard
 48868	saying.
 48869	
 48870	An interpreter rode up to the group.
 48871	
 48872	âTake off your cap... your caps!â These words went from one to another
 48873	in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if
 48874	it was far to the KrÃ©mlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the
 48875	unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was
 48876	speaking Russian, did not understand what was being said to him and
 48877	slipped behind the others.
 48878	
 48879	Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian
 48880	army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several
 48881	voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer,
 48882	returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported
 48883	that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was
 48884	probably an ambuscade there.
 48885	
 48886	âGood!â said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,
 48887	ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.
 48888	
 48889	The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced
 48890	up the ArbÃ¡t. When they reached the end of the VozdvÃ­zhenka Street they
 48891	halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers superintended the
 48892	placing of the guns and looked at the KrÃ©mlin through field glasses.
 48893	
 48894	The bells in the KrÃ©mlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound
 48895	troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few
 48896	infantrymen ran to the KutÃ¡fyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been
 48897	put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as
 48898	an officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was standing
 48899	by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter
 48900	ran back again with his men.
 48901	
 48902	The sound of three more shots came from the gate.
 48903	
 48904	One shot struck a French soldierâs foot, and from behind the screens
 48905	came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a
 48906	word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of
 48907	the French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined
 48908	concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from
 48909	the marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the VozdvÃ­zhenka,
 48910	MokhavÃ¡ya, or KutÃ¡fyev Street, nor the TrÃ³itsa Gate (places familiar in
 48911	Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary.
 48912	And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The
 48913	guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks,
 48914	and an officer gave the word âFire!â This was followed by two whistling
 48915	sounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against
 48916	the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and two
 48917	wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.
 48918	
 48919	A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the
 48920	stone-built KrÃ©mlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above
 48921	their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the
 48922	air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound
 48923	came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared
 48924	the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasantâs coat. He grasped a musket
 48925	and took aim at the French. âFire!â repeated the officer once more,
 48926	and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard
 48927	simultaneously. The gate was again hidden by smoke.
 48928	
 48929	Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers
 48930	and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and
 48931	four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall,
 48932	toward the ZnÃ¡menka.
 48933	
 48934	âClear that away!â said the officer, pointing to the beams and the
 48935	corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw
 48936	the corpses over the parapet.
 48937	
 48938	Who these men were nobody knew. âClear that away!â was all that was said
 48939	of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that
 48940	they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to
 48941	their memory: âThese wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having
 48942	supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and firedâ (the
 48943	wretches) âat the French. Some of them were sabered and the KrÃ©mlin was
 48944	purged of their presence.â
 48945	
 48946	Murat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered
 48947	the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the
 48948	windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square
 48949	for fuel and kindled fires there.
 48950	
 48951	Other detachments passed through the KrÃ©mlin and encamped along
 48952	the MorosÃ©yka, the LubyÃ¡nka, and PokrÃ³vka Streets. Others quartered
 48953	themselves along the VozdvÃ­zhenka, the NikÃ³lski, and the TverskÃ³y
 48954	Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were
 48955	not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as
 48956	in a camp.
 48957	
 48958	Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their
 48959	original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It
 48960	was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But
 48961	it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their
 48962	different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began
 48963	to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost
 48964	forever and there came into being something nondescript, neither
 48965	citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks
 48966	later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They
 48967	were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which
 48968	seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left
 48969	Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep
 48970	what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow
 48971	neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its
 48972	fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the
 48973	French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they
 48974	carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as
 48975	impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let
 48976	go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow
 48977	district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms
 48978	and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and
 48979	walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were
 48980	busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open
 48981	coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading
 48982	and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening,
 48983	amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both
 48984	in the shops and housesâbut there was no army.
 48985	
 48986	Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day
 48987	forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any
 48988	violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call
 48989	for that very evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had
 48990	till then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted
 48991	city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of
 48992	cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out
 48993	of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich
 48994	pastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city.
 48995	
 48996	No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiersâlike water
 48997	percolating through sandâspread irresistibly through the city in all
 48998	directions from the KrÃ©mlin into which they had first marched. The
 48999	cavalry, on entering a merchantâs house that had been abandoned and
 49000	finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,
 49001	all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of
 49002	them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and
 49003	quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had
 49004	had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to
 49005	see the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed
 49006	to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers
 49007	followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing
 49008	the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and
 49009	generals flocked there to select calÃ¨ches and coaches for themselves.
 49010	The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to
 49011	their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered.
 49012	There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around
 49013	the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored
 49014	and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found.
 49015	And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is
 49016	spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and
 49017	mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the
 49018	rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction
 49019	of both the army and the wealthy city.
 49020	
 49021	
 49022	The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme fÃ©roce de
 49023	RostopchÃ­ne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,
 49024	however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning
 49025	of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible
 49026	for it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which
 49027	any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it
 49028	had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted
 49029	Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on
 49030	which sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood,
 49031	where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners
 49032	are in residence and a police force is present, cannot help burning when
 49033	its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke
 49034	pipes, make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and
 49035	cook themselves meals twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to
 49036	billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in
 49037	that district immediately increases. How much then must the probability
 49038	of fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops
 49039	are quartered. âLe patriotisme fÃ©roce de RostopchÃ­neâ and the barbarity
 49040	of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by
 49041	the soldiersâ pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of
 49042	enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any
 49043	arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the
 49044	housesâin any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson
 49045	cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same thing would have happened
 49046	without any incendiarism.
 49047	
 49048	    * To RostopchÃ­nâs ferocious patriotism.
 49049	
 49050	However tempting it might be for the French to blame RostopchÃ­nâs
 49051	ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later
 49052	on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is
 49053	impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the
 49054	fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house must
 49055	burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to
 49056	live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it
 49057	is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained
 49058	in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like
 49059	Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants
 49060	abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor
 49061	bring them the keys of the city.
 49062

 49066	
 49067	CHAPTER XXVII
 49068	
 49069	The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it did,
 49070	only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the
 49071	second of September.
 49072	
 49073	After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances,
 49074	Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely obsessed
 49075	by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had
 49076	taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past,
 49077	understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to
 49078	him like a dream.
 49079	
 49080	He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifeâs demands
 49081	that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable
 49082	to unravel. He had gone to Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs house, on the plea of
 49083	sorting the deceasedâs books and papers, only in search of rest from
 49084	lifeâs turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph AlexÃ©evich was
 49085	connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite
 49086	contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being
 49087	drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph AlexÃ©evichâs study he
 49088	really found it. When he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table
 49089	in the deathlike stillness of the study, calm and significant memories
 49090	of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination,
 49091	particularly of the battle of BorodinÃ³ and of that vague sense of his
 49092	own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth, simplicity,
 49093	and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they. When
 49094	GerÃ¡sim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking
 49095	part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected. And
 49096	with that object he had asked GerÃ¡sim to get him a peasantâs coat and
 49097	a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph
 49098	AlexÃ©evichâs house and keeping his name secret. Then during the first
 49099	day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his
 49100	attention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea
 49101	that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of
 49102	his name in connection with Bonaparteâs more than once vaguely presented
 49103	itself. But the idea that he, Lârusse Besuhof, was destined to set a
 49104	limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that
 49105	often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.
 49106	
 49107	When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among
 49108	the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the RostÃ³vs and
 49109	NatÃ¡sha had said to him: âAre you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!â
 49110	the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing,
 49111	even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was
 49112	predestined to do.
 49113	
 49114	Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in
 49115	any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he
 49116	returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he
 49117	suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility
 49118	had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in
 49119	Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and
 49120	either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europeâwhich it seemed
 49121	to him was solely due to Napoleon.
 49122	
 49123	Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparteâs life in 1809
 49124	by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot.
 49125	And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his
 49126	design excited him still more.
 49127	
 49128	Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose.
 49129	The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in
 49130	view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go
 49131	to MozhÃ¡ysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick
 49132	of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and, in
 49133	place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep
 49134	on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as GerÃ¡sim.
 49135	The other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for
 49136	everything conventional, artificial, and humanâfor everything the
 49137	majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had
 49138	first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the SlobÃ³da
 49139	Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and lifeâall that
 49140	men so painstakingly acquire and guardâif it has any worth has so only
 49141	by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.
 49142	
 49143	It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last
 49144	penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no
 49145	apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he
 49146	possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from
 49147	an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal
 49148	power and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman
 49149	criterion of life.
 49150	
 49151	From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time
 49152	at the SlobÃ³da Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but
 49153	only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre
 49154	was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he
 49155	had already done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like
 49156	everyone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and
 49157	his announcement to the RostÃ³vs that he would remain in Moscow would all
 49158	become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to
 49159	this Pierre was very sensitive.
 49160	
 49161	Pierreâs physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his
 49162	mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during
 49163	those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen,
 49164	two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without beddingâall
 49165	this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.
 49166	
 49167	It was two oâclock in the afternoon. The French had already entered
 49168	Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about
 49169	his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his
 49170	fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the
 49171	blow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and
 49172	melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.
 49173	
 49174	âYes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!â he thought.
 49175	âYes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger?
 49176	But that is all the same! âIt is not I but the hand of Providence that
 49177	punishes thee,â I shall say,â thought he, imagining what he would say
 49178	when killing Napoleon. âWell then, take me and execute me!â he went on,
 49179	speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.
 49180	
 49181	While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself
 49182	in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared
 49183	the figure of MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, always so timid before but now quite
 49184	transformed.
 49185	
 49186	His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He
 49187	was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but
 49188	noticing embarrassment on Pierreâs face immediately grew bold and,
 49189	staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.
 49190	
 49191	âTheyâre frightened,â he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. âI say I
 49192	wonât surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?â
 49193	
 49194	He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it
 49195	with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.
 49196	
 49197	GerÃ¡sim and the porter, who had followed MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, stopped him
 49198	in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming
 49199	out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy
 49200	old man. MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol
 49201	and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.
 49202	
 49203	âTo arms! Board them! No, you shanât get it,â he yelled.
 49204	
 49205	âThat will do, please, that will do. Have the goodnessâplease, sir, to
 49206	let go! Please, sir...â pleaded GerÃ¡sim, trying carefully to steer MakÃ¡r
 49207	AlexÃ©evich by the elbows back to the door.
 49208	
 49209	âWho are you? Bonaparte!...â shouted MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich.
 49210	
 49211	âThatâs not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to
 49212	have the pistol.â
 49213	
 49214	âBe off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?â shouted MakÃ¡r
 49215	AlexÃ©evich, brandishing the pistol. âBoard them!â
 49216	
 49217	âCatch hold!â whispered GerÃ¡sim to the porter.
 49218	
 49219	They seized MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich by the arms and dragged him to the door.
 49220	
 49221	The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of
 49222	a tipsy, hoarse voice.
 49223	
 49224	Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from
 49225	the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.
 49226	
 49227	âItâs them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!â she
 49228	cried.
 49229	
 49230	GerÃ¡sim and the porter let MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich go, and in the now silent
 49231	corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be
 49232	heard.
 49233	
 49234	
 49235	
 49236	
 49237	
 49238	CHAPTER XXVIII
 49239	
 49240	Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would
 49241	disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the
 49242	half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon
 49243	as the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not
 49244	retireâan irresistible curiosity kept him there.
 49245	
 49246	There were two of them. One was an officerâa tall, soldierly, handsome
 49247	manâthe other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and
 49248	thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer walked in
 49249	front, leaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced
 49250	a few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were good
 49251	quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in
 49252	a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done
 49253	that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his
 49254	mustache and lightly touched his hat.
 49255	
 49256	âBonjour, la compagnie!â * said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.
 49257	
 49258	    * âGood day, everybody!â
 49259	
 49260	
 49261	No one gave any reply.
 49262	
 49263	âVous Ãªtes le bourgeois?â * the officer asked GerÃ¡sim.
 49264	
 49265	    * âAre you the master here?â
 49266	
 49267	
 49268	GerÃ¡sim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.
 49269	
 49270	âQuartier, quartier, logement!â said the officer, looking down at the
 49271	little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. âLes franÃ§ais
 49272	sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fÃ¢chons pas, mon
 49273	vieux!â * added he, clapping the scared and silent GerÃ¡sim on the
 49274	shoulder. âWell, does no one speak French in this establishment?â he
 49275	asked again in French, looking around and meeting Pierreâs eyes. Pierre
 49276	moved away from the door.
 49277	
 49278	     * âQuarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good
 49279	     fellows. What the devil! There, donât let us be cross, old
 49280	     fellow!â
 49281	
 49282	
 49283	Again the officer turned to GerÃ¡sim and asked him to show him the rooms
 49284	in the house.
 49285	
 49286	âMaster, not hereâdonât understand... me, you...â said GerÃ¡sim, trying
 49287	to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.
 49288	
 49289	Still smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before GerÃ¡simâs
 49290	nose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved,
 49291	limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go
 49292	away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich
 49293	appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With
 49294	a madmanâs cunning, MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich eyed the Frenchman, raised his
 49295	pistol, and took aim.
 49296	
 49297	âBoard them!â yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing
 49298	the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw
 49299	himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the
 49300	pistol MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there
 49301	was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The
 49302	Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.
 49303	
 49304	Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,
 49305	snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer
 49306	and addressed him in French.
 49307	
 49308	âYou are not wounded?â he asked.
 49309	
 49310	âI think not,â answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. âBut I have
 49311	had a lucky escape this time,â he added, pointing to the damaged plaster
 49312	of the wall. âWho is that man?â said he, looking sternly at Pierre.
 49313	
 49314	âOh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,â said Pierre rapidly,
 49315	quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. âHe is an unfortunate
 49316	madman who did not know what he was doing.â
 49317	
 49318	The officer went up to MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich and took him by the collar.
 49319	
 49320	MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to
 49321	fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.
 49322	
 49323	âBrigand! You shall pay for this,â said the Frenchman, letting go
 49324	of him. âWe French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon
 49325	traitors,â he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic
 49326	gesture.
 49327	
 49328	Pierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that
 49329	drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the
 49330	same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For
 49331	a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a
 49332	melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.
 49333	
 49334	âYou have saved my life. You are French,â said he.
 49335	
 49336	For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman could
 49337	perform a great deed, and to save his lifeâthe life of M. Ramballe,
 49338	captain of the 13th Light Regimentâwas undoubtedly a very great deed.
 49339	
 49340	But however indubitable that conclusion and the officerâs conviction
 49341	based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.
 49342	
 49343	âI am Russian,â he said quickly.
 49344	
 49345	âTut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,â said the officer, waving his
 49346	finger before his nose and smiling. âYou shall tell me all about that
 49347	presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we
 49348	to do with this man?â he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a
 49349	brother.
 49350	
 49351	Even if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest
 49352	of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officerâs look
 49353	and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who MakÃ¡r
 49354	AlexÃ©evich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile
 49355	had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from
 49356	him, and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.
 49357	
 49358	The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his
 49359	arm.
 49360	
 49361	âYou have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it
 49362	you. Lead that man away!â said he quickly and energetically, and taking
 49363	the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his
 49364	life, he went with him into the room.
 49365	
 49366	The soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking
 49367	what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits,
 49368	but the officer sternly checked them.
 49369	
 49370	âYou will be called in when you are wanted,â he said.
 49371	
 49372	The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had time
 49373	to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.
 49374	
 49375	âCaptain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,â said he.
 49376	âShall I serve them up?â
 49377	
 49378	âYes, and some wine,â answered the captain.
 49379	
 49380	
 49381	
 49382	
 49383	
 49384	CHAPTER XXIX
 49385	
 49386	When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again
 49387	thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to
 49388	go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite,
 49389	amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his
 49390	life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in
 49391	the parlorâthe first room they entered. To Pierreâs assurances that he
 49392	was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone
 49393	could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and
 49394	said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it
 49395	be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude
 49396	for saving his life.
 49397	
 49398	Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the
 49399	feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierreâs feelings
 49400	were, the latter would probably have left him, but the manâs animated
 49401	obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.
 49402	
 49403	âA Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,â said the officer, looking
 49404	at Pierreâs fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger.
 49405	âI owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never
 49406	forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That
 49407	is all I can say.â
 49408	
 49409	There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the
 49410	word) in the officerâs voice, in the expression of his face and in
 49411	his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the
 49412	Frenchmanâs smile, pressed the hand held out to him.
 49413	
 49414	âCaptain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion
 49415	of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,â he introduced
 49416	himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under
 49417	his mustache. âWill you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have
 49418	the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance
 49419	with that maniacâs bullet in my body?â
 49420	
 49421	Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,
 49422	began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for
 49423	concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.
 49424	
 49425	âOh, please!â said he. âI understand your reasons. You are an officer...
 49426	a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. Thatâs not
 49427	my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at
 49428	your service. You belong to the gentry?â he concluded with a shade of
 49429	inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. âYour baptismal name, if you
 49430	please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... Thatâs all I
 49431	want to know.â
 49432	
 49433	When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka
 49434	brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar
 49435	and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and
 49436	himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man,
 49437	munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking
 49438	his lips, and repeatingââExcellent! Delicious!â His face grew red and
 49439	was covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner
 49440	with pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan
 49441	and placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass,
 49442	taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known
 49443	to the French and had been given a special name. They called it limonade
 49444	de cochon (pigâs lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de
 49445	cochon he had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they
 49446	had taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and
 49447	applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up
 49448	to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
 49449	Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain
 49450	still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.
 49451	
 49452	âYes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for
 49453	saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my
 49454	body already. Here is one I got at Wagramâ (he touched his side) âand a
 49455	second at SmolÃ©nskââhe showed a scar on his cheekââand this leg which as
 49456	you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great
 49457	battle of la Moskowa. SacrÃ© Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire
 49458	was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may
 49459	be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I
 49460	should be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see it.â
 49461	
 49462	âI was there,â said Pierre.
 49463	
 49464	âBah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The
 49465	great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!â continued the Frenchman. âAnd
 49466	you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three timesâsure as I sit here.
 49467	Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back
 49468	like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your
 49469	grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six
 49470	times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of
 49471	Naples, who knows whatâs what, cried âBravo!â Ha, ha! So you are one of
 49472	us soldiers!â he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. âSo much
 49473	the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle...
 49474	gallant... with the fairâ (he winked and smiled), âthatâs what the
 49475	French are, Monsieur Pierre, arenât they?â
 49476	
 49477	The captain was so naÃ¯vely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so
 49478	pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily
 49479	at him. Probably the word âgallantâ turned the captainâs thoughts to the
 49480	state of Moscow.
 49481	
 49482	âApropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left
 49483	Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?â
 49484	
 49485	âWould not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?â
 49486	asked Pierre.
 49487	
 49488	âHa, ha, ha!â The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting
 49489	Pierre on the shoulder. âWhat a thing to say!â he exclaimed. âParis?...
 49490	But Paris, Paris...â
 49491	
 49492	âParisâthe capital of the world,â Pierre finished his remark for him.
 49493	
 49494	The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the
 49495	middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.
 49496	
 49497	âWell, if you hadnât told me you were Russian, I should have wagered
 49498	that you were Parisian! You have that... I donât know what, that...â and
 49499	having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.
 49500	
 49501	âI have been in Paris. I spent years there,â said Pierre.
 49502	
 49503	âOh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesnât know Paris
 49504	is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la
 49505	DuchÃ©nois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,â and noticing that
 49506	his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly:
 49507	âThere is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have
 49508	remained Russian. Well, I donât esteem you the less for it.â
 49509	
 49510	Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had
 49511	spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed
 49512	talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.
 49513	
 49514	âTo return to your ladiesâI hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea
 49515	to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in
 49516	Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, nowâthatâs
 49517	another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better
 49518	than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all
 49519	the worldâs capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to
 49520	know. And then the Emperor...â he began, but Pierre interrupted him.
 49521	
 49522	âThe Emperor,â Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and
 49523	embarrassed, âis the Emperor...?â
 49524	
 49525	âThe Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, geniusâthatâs
 49526	what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you
 49527	I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But
 49528	that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist
 49529	the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France.
 49530	When I understood what he wantedâwhen I saw that he was preparing a bed
 49531	of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: âThat is a monarch,â and
 49532	I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest
 49533	man of the ages past or future.â
 49534	
 49535	âIs he in Moscow?â Pierre stammered with a guilty look.
 49536	
 49537	The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.
 49538	
 49539	âNo, he will make his entry tomorrow,â he replied, and continued his
 49540	talk.
 49541	
 49542	Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at
 49543	the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some WÃ¼rttemberg hussars had
 49544	come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captainâs
 49545	horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did
 49546	not understand what was said to them in French.
 49547	
 49548	The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice
 49549	asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer,
 49550	and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already
 49551	occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first
 49552	questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding
 49553	officer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand
 49554	said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the
 49555	quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to
 49556	occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German,
 49557	translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captainâs
 49558	reply to the WÃ¼rttemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what
 49559	was said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The
 49560	captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.
 49561	
 49562	When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as
 49563	before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He
 49564	really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he
 49565	was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position
 49566	he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy
 49567	conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as
 49568	that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was
 49569	tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of
 49570	wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had
 49571	destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last
 49572	few days and which was essential for the execution of his design. The
 49573	pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the
 49574	town next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and
 49575	worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not
 49576	do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not
 49577	carry out his intention. He struggled against the confession of his
 49578	weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his
 49579	former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and
 49580	self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first
 49581	man he met.
 49582	
 49583	The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.
 49584	
 49585	The Frenchmanâs chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled
 49586	him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which
 49587	he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. âI will go away
 49588	immediately. I wonât say another word to him,â thought Pierre. He
 49589	thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of
 49590	weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but
 49591	could not do so.
 49592	
 49593	The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and
 49594	down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he
 49595	were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.
 49596	
 49597	âThe colonel of those WÃ¼rttembergers is delightful,â he suddenly said.
 49598	âHeâs a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But heâs a German.â
 49599	He sat down facing Pierre. âBy the way, you know German, then?â
 49600	
 49601	Pierre looked at him in silence.
 49602	
 49603	âWhat is the German for âshelterâ?â
 49604	
 49605	âShelter?â Pierre repeated. âThe German for shelter is Unterkunft.â
 49606	
 49607	âHow do you say it?â the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.
 49608	
 49609	âUnterkunft,â Pierre repeated.
 49610	
 49611	âOnterkoff,â said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with
 49612	laughing eyes. âThese Germans are first-rate fools, donât you think so,
 49613	Monsieur Pierre?â he concluded.
 49614	
 49615	âWell, letâs have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we?
 49616	Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!â he called out
 49617	gaily.
 49618	
 49619	Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre
 49620	by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression
 49621	on his companionâs face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in
 49622	his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.
 49623	
 49624	âThere now, weâre sad,â said he, touching Pierreâs hand. âHave I
 49625	upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?â he asked Pierre.
 49626	âPerhaps itâs the state of affairs?â
 49627	
 49628	Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchmanâs eyes
 49629	whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.
 49630	
 49631	âHonestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for
 49632	you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death.
 49633	I say it with my hand on my heart!â said he, striking his chest.
 49634	
 49635	âThank you,â said Pierre.
 49636	
 49637	The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that
 49638	âshelterâ was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.
 49639	
 49640	âWell, in that case, I drink to our friendship!â he cried gaily, filling
 49641	two glasses with wine.
 49642	
 49643	Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too,
 49644	again pressed Pierreâs hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a
 49645	pensive attitude.
 49646	
 49647	âYes, my dear friend,â he began, âsuch is fortuneâs caprice. Who would
 49648	have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the
 49649	service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow
 49650	with him. I must tell you, mon cher,â he continued in the sad and
 49651	measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, âthat our name
 49652	is one of the most ancient in France.â
 49653	
 49654	And with a Frenchmanâs easy and naÃ¯ve frankness the captain told Pierre
 49655	the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all
 49656	about his relations and his financial and family affairs, âma pauvre
 49657	mÃ¨reâ playing of course an important part in the story.
 49658	
 49659	âBut all that is only lifeâs setting, the real thing is loveâlove! Am I
 49660	not right, Monsieur Pierre?â said he, growing animated. âAnother glass?â
 49661	
 49662	Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.
 49663	
 49664	âOh, women, women!â and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at
 49665	Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.
 49666	
 49667	There were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking
 49668	at the officerâs handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager
 49669	enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballeâs love
 49670	stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special
 49671	charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere
 49672	conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love
 49673	and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with
 49674	curiosity.
 49675	
 49676	It was plain that lâamour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not
 49677	that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor
 49678	was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for
 49679	NatÃ¡sha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one
 49680	he considered the âlove of clodhoppersâ and the other the âlove
 49681	of simpletons.â) Lâamour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted
 49682	principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a
 49683	combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.
 49684	
 49685	Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a
 49686	fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming,
 49687	innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The
 49688	conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in
 49689	the motherâs sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage
 49690	to her lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of
 49691	a distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played
 49692	the part of the lover, and heâthe loverâassumed the role of the husband,
 49693	as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany,
 49694	where âshelterâ is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat
 49695	sauerkraut and the young girls are âtoo blonde.â
 49696	
 49697	Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captainâs
 49698	memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was
 49699	of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of
 49700	life continually occurred in the captainâs stories) and the Pole had
 49701	entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de cÅur) while himself
 49702	entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting
 49703	Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the
 49704	captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: âI have
 49705	saved your life, and I save your honor!â Having repeated these words the
 49706	captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the
 49707	weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.
 49708	
 49709	Listening to the captainâs tales, Pierreâas often happens late in the
 49710	evening and under the influence of wineâfollowed all that was told him,
 49711	understood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal
 49712	memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While
 49713	listening to these love stories his own love for NatÃ¡sha unexpectedly
 49714	rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his
 49715	imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballeâs tales. Listening
 49716	to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before
 49717	his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of
 49718	his love at the SÃºkharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had
 49719	not produced an effect upon himâhe had not even once recalled it. But
 49720	now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very
 49721	important and poetic.
 49722	
 49723	âPeter KirÃ­lovich, come here! We have recognized you,â he now seemed
 49724	to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her
 49725	smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there
 49726	seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.
 49727	
 49728	Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain
 49729	asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice
 49730	himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.
 49731	
 49732	Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to
 49733	express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he
 49734	understood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all
 49735	his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could
 49736	never be his.
 49737	
 49738	âTiens!â said the captain.
 49739	
 49740	Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest
 49741	years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too
 49742	young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.
 49743	Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of
 49744	her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in
 49745	the world, and especially therefore above himself.
 49746	
 49747	When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he
 49748	understood that.
 49749	
 49750	The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand
 49751	it he begged Pierre to continue.
 49752	
 49753	âPlatÃ³nic love, clouds...â he muttered.
 49754	
 49755	Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the
 49756	thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who
 49757	played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together,
 49758	something loosened Pierreâs tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway
 49759	look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his
 49760	marriage, NatÃ¡shaâs love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and
 49761	all his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballeâs questions
 49762	he also told what he had at first concealedâhis own position and even
 49763	his name.
 49764	
 49765	More than anything else in Pierreâs story the captain was impressed by
 49766	the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that
 49767	he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there
 49768	concealing his name and station.
 49769	
 49770	When it was late at night they went out together into the street. The
 49771	night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the PokrÃ³vka a
 49772	fire glowedâthe first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the
 49773	right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
 49774	opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierreâs
 49775	heart with his love. At the gate stood GerÃ¡sim, the cook, and two
 49776	Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in
 49777	two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the
 49778	town.
 49779	
 49780	There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense
 49781	city.
 49782	
 49783	Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the
 49784	glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. âThere now,
 49785	how good it is, what more does one need?â thought he. And suddenly
 49786	remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned
 49787	against the fence to save himself from falling.
 49788	
 49789	Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with
 49790	unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and
 49791	immediately fell asleep.
 49792	
 49793	
 49794	
 49795	
 49796	
 49797	CHAPTER XXX
 49798	
 49799	The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was
 49800	watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the
 49801	retreating troops, with many different feelings.
 49802	
 49803	The RostÃ³v party spent the night at MytÃ­shchi, fourteen miles from
 49804	Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road
 49805	had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been
 49806	forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided to
 49807	spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning
 49808	they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far
 49809	as Great MytÃ­shchi. At ten oâclock that evening the RostÃ³v family and
 49810	the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and
 49811	huts of that large village. The RostÃ³vsâ servants and coachmen and the
 49812	orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had
 49813	supper, fed the horses, and came out into the porches.
 49814	
 49815	In a neighboring hut lay RaÃ©vskiâs adjutant with a fractured wrist. The
 49816	awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his
 49817	moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had
 49818	spent the first night in the same yard as the RostÃ³vs. The countess said
 49819	she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at
 49820	MytÃ­shchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the
 49821	wounded man.
 49822	
 49823	In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high
 49824	body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another
 49825	fire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was
 49826	Little MytÃ­shchi burningâset on fire by MamÃ³novâs Cossacks.
 49827	
 49828	âBut look here, brothers, thereâs another fire!â remarked an orderly.
 49829	
 49830	All turned their attention to the glow.
 49831	
 49832	âBut they told us Little MytÃ­shchi had been set on fire by MamÃ³novâs
 49833	Cossacks.â
 49834	
 49835	âBut thatâs not MytÃ­shchi, itâs farther away.â
 49836	
 49837	âLook, it must be in Moscow!â
 49838	
 49839	Two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down
 49840	on its steps.
 49841	
 49842	âItâs more to the left, why, Little MytÃ­shchi is over there, and this is
 49843	right on the other side.â
 49844	
 49845	Several men joined the first two.
 49846	
 49847	âSee how itâs flaring,â said one. âThatâs a fire in Moscow: either in
 49848	the SushchÃ©vski or the RogÃ³zhski quarter.â
 49849	
 49850	No one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently
 49851	at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.
 49852	
 49853	Old Daniel TerÃ©ntich, the countâs valet (as he was called), came up to
 49854	the group and shouted at MÃ­shka.
 49855	
 49856	âWhat are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be
 49857	calling and thereâs nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.â
 49858	
 49859	âI only ran out to get some water,â said MÃ­shka.
 49860	
 49861	âBut what do you think, Daniel TerÃ©ntich? Doesnât it look as if that
 49862	glow were in Moscow?â remarked one of the footmen.
 49863	
 49864	Daniel TerÃ©ntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all
 49865	silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.
 49866	
 49867	âGod have mercy.... Itâs windy and dry...â said another voice.
 49868	
 49869	âJust look! See what itâs doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows
 49870	flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!â
 49871	
 49872	âTheyâll put it out, no fear!â
 49873	
 49874	âWhoâs to put it out?â Daniel TerÃ©ntich, who had hitherto been silent,
 49875	was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. âMoscow it is,
 49876	brothers,â said he. âMother Moscow, the white...â his voice faltered,
 49877	and he gave way to an old manâs sob.
 49878	
 49879	And it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the
 49880	significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard,
 49881	words of prayer, and the sobbing of the countâs old valet.

 49887	CHAPTER XXXI
 49888	
 49889	The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was
 49890	burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. SÃ³nya
 49891	and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only
 49892	NatÃ¡sha and the countess remained in the room. PÃ©tya was no longer
 49893	with the family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for
 49894	TrÃ³itsa.
 49895	
 49896	The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. NatÃ¡sha,
 49897	pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just
 49898	where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her fatherâs
 49899	words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three
 49900	houses off.
 49901	
 49902	âOh, how terrible,â said SÃ³nya returning from the yard chilled and
 49903	frightened. âI believe the whole of Moscow will burn, thereâs an awful
 49904	glow! NatÃ¡sha, do look! You can see it from the window,â she said to her
 49905	cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.
 49906	
 49907	But NatÃ¡sha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her
 49908	and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in
 49909	this condition of stupor since the morning, when SÃ³nya, to the surprise
 49910	and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found
 49911	it necessary to tell NatÃ¡sha of Prince Andrewâs wound and of his being
 49912	with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as
 49913	she was with SÃ³nya. SÃ³nya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now,
 49914	as if trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her
 49915	cousin.
 49916	
 49917	âLook, NatÃ¡sha, how dreadfully it is burning!â said she.
 49918	
 49919	âWhatâs burning?â asked NatÃ¡sha. âOh, yes, Moscow.â
 49920	
 49921	And as if in order not to offend SÃ³nya and to get rid of her, she turned
 49922	her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident
 49923	that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former
 49924	attitude.
 49925	
 49926	âBut you didnât see it!â
 49927	
 49928	âYes, really I did,â NatÃ¡sha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left
 49929	in peace.
 49930	
 49931	Both the countess and SÃ³nya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow
 49932	nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to
 49933	NatÃ¡sha.
 49934	
 49935	The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went
 49936	up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she
 49937	was wont to do when NatÃ¡sha was ill, then touched her forehead with her
 49938	lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.
 49939	
 49940	âYou are cold. You are trembling all over. Youâd better lie down,â said
 49941	the countess.
 49942	
 49943	âLie down? All right, I will. Iâll lie down at once,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 49944	
 49945	When NatÃ¡sha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously
 49946	wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many
 49947	questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And
 49948	could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see
 49949	him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger,
 49950	she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving
 49951	what they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would
 49952	still be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner
 49953	of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the
 49954	countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same
 49955	way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was
 49956	planning something and either deciding or had already decided something
 49957	in her mind. The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not
 49958	know, and this alarmed and tormented her.
 49959	
 49960	âNatÃ¡sha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.â
 49961	
 49962	A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss
 49963	and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.
 49964	
 49965	âNo, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,â NatÃ¡sha replied
 49966	irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open
 49967	window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put
 49968	her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck
 49969	shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. NatÃ¡sha knew
 49970	it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in
 49971	the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage;
 49972	but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged
 49973	a look with SÃ³nya.
 49974	
 49975	âLie down, darling; lie down, my pet,â said the countess, softly
 49976	touching NatÃ¡shaâs shoulders. âCome, lie down.â
 49977	
 49978	âOh, yes... Iâll lie down at once,â said NatÃ¡sha, and began hurriedly
 49979	undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.
 49980	
 49981	When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat
 49982	down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the
 49983	floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front,
 49984	and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly
 49985	unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side
 49986	to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before
 49987	her. When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the
 49988	sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door.
 49989	
 49990	âNatÃ¡sha, youâd better lie in the middle,â said SÃ³nya.
 49991	
 49992	âIâll stay here,â muttered NatÃ¡sha. âDo lie down,â she added crossly,
 49993	and buried her face in the pillow.
 49994	
 49995	The countess, Madame Schoss, and SÃ³nya undressed hastily and lay down.
 49996	The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in
 49997	the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little
 49998	MytÃ­shchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise
 49999	of people shouting at a tavern MamÃ³novâs Cossacks had set up across the
 50000	street, and the adjutantâs unceasing moans could still be heard.
 50001	
 50002	For a long time NatÃ¡sha listened attentively to the sounds that reached
 50003	her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard
 50004	her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under
 50005	her, then Madame Schossâ familiar whistling snore and SÃ³nyaâs gentle
 50006	breathing. Then the countess called to NatÃ¡sha. NatÃ¡sha did not answer.
 50007	
 50008	âI think sheâs asleep, Mamma,â said SÃ³nya softly.
 50009	
 50010	After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one
 50011	replied.
 50012	
 50013	Soon after that NatÃ¡sha heard her motherâs even breathing. NatÃ¡sha did
 50014	not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt,
 50015	was growing cold on the bare floor.
 50016	
 50017	As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a
 50018	crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near
 50019	by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the
 50020	adjutant was heard. NatÃ¡sha sat up.
 50021	
 50022	âSÃ³nya, are you asleep? Mamma?â she whispered.
 50023	
 50024	No one replied. NatÃ¡sha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and
 50025	stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple,
 50026	bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one
 50027	foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and
 50028	grasped the cold door handle.
 50029	
 50030	It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against
 50031	all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and
 50032	terror and overflowing with love.
 50033	
 50034	She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,
 50035	damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With
 50036	her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened
 50037	the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark
 50038	in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which
 50039	something was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and
 50040	smoldering wick.
 50041	
 50042	From the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrewâs wound
 50043	and his presence there, NatÃ¡sha had resolved to see him. She did not
 50044	know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the
 50045	more convinced that it was necessary.
 50046	
 50047	All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now
 50048	that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might
 50049	see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant
 50050	moaning of the adjutantâs? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her
 50051	imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an
 50052	indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the
 50053	quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood
 50054	still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She
 50055	cautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the
 50056	middle of a small room containing baggage. Another manâTimÃ³khinâwas
 50057	lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two othersâthe
 50058	doctor and a valetâlay on the floor.
 50059	
 50060	The valet sat up and whispered something. TimÃ³khin, kept awake by the
 50061	pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange
 50062	apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap.
 50063	The valetâs sleepy, frightened exclamation, âWhat do you want? Whatâs
 50064	the matter?â made NatÃ¡sha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the
 50065	corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him.
 50066	She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw
 50067	Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she
 50068	had always seen him.
 50069	
 50070	He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his
 50071	glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck,
 50072	delicate as a childâs, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt,
 50073	gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never
 50074	seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible,
 50075	youthful movement dropped on her knees.
 50076	
 50077	He smiled and held out his hand to her.
 50078	
 50079	
 50080	
 50081	
 50082	
 50083	CHAPTER XXXII
 50084	
 50085	Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the
 50086	ambulance station on the field of BorodinÃ³. His feverish state and the
 50087	inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctorâs
 50088	opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with
 50089	pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his
 50090	temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.
 50091	The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had
 50092	remained in the calÃ¨che, but at MytÃ­shchi the wounded man himself asked
 50093	to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into
 50094	the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he
 50095	had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with
 50096	closed eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: âAnd the tea?â
 50097	His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished
 50098	the doctor. He felt Prince Andrewâs pulse, and to his surprise and
 50099	dissatisfaction found it had improved. He was dissatisfied because he
 50100	knew by experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do so
 50101	a little later with greater suffering. TimÃ³khin, the red-nosed major of
 50102	Prince Andrewâs regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being
 50103	taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of
 50104	BorodinÃ³. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrewâs valet, his
 50105	coachman, and two orderlies.
 50106	
 50107	They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with
 50108	feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and
 50109	remember something.
 50110	
 50111	âI donât want any more. Is TimÃ³khin here?â he asked.
 50112	
 50113	TimÃ³khin crept along the bench to him.
 50114	
 50115	âI am here, your excellency.â
 50116	
 50117	âHowâs your wound?â
 50118	
 50119	âMine, sir? All right. But how about you?â
 50120	
 50121	Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.
 50122	
 50123	âCouldnât one get a book?â he asked.
 50124	
 50125	âWhat book?â
 50126	
 50127	âThe Gospels. I havenât one.â
 50128	
 50129	The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he
 50130	was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but
 50131	reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was
 50132	uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak
 50133	with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of
 50134	mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful
 50135	place. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a
 50136	change in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned
 50137	again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking
 50138	them to get him the book and put it under him.
 50139	
 50140	âWhat trouble would it be to you?â he said. âI have not got one. Please
 50141	get it for me and put it under for a moment,â he pleaded in a piteous
 50142	voice.
 50143	
 50144	The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.
 50145	
 50146	âYou fellows have no conscience,â said he to the valet who was pouring
 50147	water over his hands. âFor just one moment I didnât look after you...
 50148	Itâs such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.â
 50149	
 50150	âBy the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!â
 50151	said the valet.
 50152	
 50153	The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the
 50154	matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked
 50155	to be carried into the hut after his calÃ¨che had stopped at MytÃ­shchi.
 50156	After growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he
 50157	again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled
 50158	all that had happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the
 50159	moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of
 50160	a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to him which promised him
 50161	happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again
 50162	possessed his soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of
 50163	happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels.
 50164	That was why he asked for a copy of them. The uncomfortable position in
 50165	which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts,
 50166	and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete
 50167	stillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket
 50168	chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in
 50169	the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on
 50170	the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the
 50171	candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself
 50172	like a mushroom.
 50173	
 50174	His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,
 50175	feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the
 50176	power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to
 50177	fix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from the
 50178	deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can
 50179	then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrewâs mind was not
 50180	in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more
 50181	active and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most
 50182	diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his
 50183	brain suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had
 50184	never reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the midst of its
 50185	work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength
 50186	to turn it back again.
 50187	
 50188	âYes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be
 50189	deprived,â he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut,
 50190	gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. âA happiness
 50191	lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act
 50192	on manâa happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man
 50193	can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only
 50194	for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?â
 50195	
 50196	And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew
 50197	heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a
 50198	soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating
 50199	âpiti-piti-piti,â and then âtiti,â and then again âpiti-piti-piti,â and
 50200	âti-tiâ once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above
 50201	the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out
 50202	of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music.
 50203	He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult) so
 50204	that this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept
 50205	collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic
 50206	musicââit stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching,â said
 50207	Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to this whispering and feeling
 50208	the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice
 50209	of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and
 50210	heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that
 50211	flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched his
 50212	face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not
 50213	destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his
 50214	face where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of
 50215	importance. It was something white by the doorâthe statue of a sphinx,
 50216	which also oppressed him.
 50217	
 50218	âBut perhaps thatâs my shirt on the table,â he thought, âand thatâs my
 50219	legs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing
 50220	itself out, and âpiti-piti-pitiâ and âti-tiâ and âpiti-piti-pitiâ...?
 50221	Thatâs enough, please leave off!â Prince Andrew painfully entreated
 50222	someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of
 50223	his mind with peculiar clearness and force.
 50224	
 50225	âYesâlove,â he thought again quite clearly. âBut not love which loves
 50226	for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason,
 50227	but the love which Iâwhile dyingâfirst experienced when I saw my enemy
 50228	and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very
 50229	essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel
 50230	that bliss. To love oneâs neighbors, to love oneâs enemies, to love
 50231	everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to
 50232	love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved
 50233	by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I
 50234	loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...
 50235	
 50236	âWhen loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but
 50237	divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can
 50238	destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have
 50239	I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did
 50240	her.â And he vividly pictured to himself NatÃ¡sha, not as he had done in
 50241	the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for
 50242	the first time picturing to himself her soul. And he understood her
 50243	feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the
 50244	first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his
 50245	rupture with her. âIf only it were possible for me to see her once more!
 50246	Just once, looking into those eyes to say...â
 50247	
 50248	âPiti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!â flopped the fly....
 50249	And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of
 50250	reality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In
 50251	that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall,
 50252	something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo
 50253	was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but
 50254	besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and
 50255	a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had
 50256	the pale face and shining eyes of the very NatÃ¡sha of whom he had just
 50257	been thinking.
 50258	
 50259	âOh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,â thought Prince Andrew,
 50260	trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained
 50261	before him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew
 50262	wished to return to that former world of pure thought, but he could not,
 50263	and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice
 50264	continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched
 50265	out, and the strange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all
 50266	his strength in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and
 50267	suddenly there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and
 50268	like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness. When he came to
 50269	himself, NatÃ¡sha, that same living NatÃ¡sha whom of all people he most
 50270	longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to
 50271	him, was kneeling before him. He realized that it was the real living
 50272	NatÃ¡sha, and he was not surprised but quietly happy. NatÃ¡sha, motionless
 50273	on her knees (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes riveted on
 50274	him, was restraining her sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the
 50275	lower part of it something quivered.
 50276	
 50277	Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.
 50278	
 50279	âYou?â he said. âHow fortunate!â
 50280	
 50281	With a rapid but careful movement NatÃ¡sha drew nearer to him on her
 50282	knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began
 50283	kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.
 50284	
 50285	âForgive me!â she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.
 50286	âForgive me!â
 50287	
 50288	âI love you,â said Prince Andrew.
 50289	
 50290	âForgive...!â
 50291	
 50292	âForgive what?â he asked.
 50293	
 50294	âForgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!â faltered NatÃ¡sha in a scarcely
 50295	audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just
 50296	touching it with her lips.
 50297	
 50298	âI love you more, better than before,â said Prince Andrew, lifting her
 50299	face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.
 50300	
 50301	Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,
 50302	compassionately, and with joyous love. NatÃ¡shaâs thin pale face, with
 50303	its swollen lips, was more than plainâit was dreadful. But Prince Andrew
 50304	did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful. They
 50305	heard the sound of voices behind them.
 50306	
 50307	Peter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.
 50308	TimÃ³khin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had
 50309	long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare
 50310	body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.
 50311	
 50312	âWhatâs this?â said the doctor, rising from his bed. âPlease go away,
 50313	madam!â
 50314	
 50315	At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her
 50316	daughterâs absence, knocked at the door.
 50317	
 50318	Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep NatÃ¡sha went out of the room
 50319	and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.
 50320	
 50321	From that time, during all the rest of the RostÃ³vsâ journey, at every
 50322	halting place and wherever they spent a night, NatÃ¡sha never left the
 50323	wounded BolkÃ³nski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected
 50324	from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a
 50325	wounded man.
 50326	
 50327	Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die
 50328	in her daughterâs arms during the journeyâas, judging by what the doctor
 50329	said, it seemed might easily happenâshe could not oppose NatÃ¡sha. Though
 50330	with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and NatÃ¡sha
 50331	the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement
 50332	would be renewed, no oneâleast of all NatÃ¡sha and Prince Andrewâspoke of
 50333	this: the unsettled question of life and death, which hung not only over
 50334	BolkÃ³nski but over all Russia, shut out all other considerations.
 50335	
 50336	
 50337	
 50338	
 50339	
 50340	CHAPTER XXXIII
 50341	
 50342	On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the
 50343	clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on
 50344	his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful
 50345	he had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterdayâs
 50346	conversation with Captain Ramballe.
 50347	
 50348	It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors.
 50349	Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved
 50350	stock which GerÃ¡sim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered
 50351	where he was and what lay before him that very day.
 50352	
 50353	âAm I not too late?â he thought. âNo, probably he wonât make his entry
 50354	into Moscow before noon.â
 50355	
 50356	Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but
 50357	hastened to act.
 50358	
 50359	After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out.
 50360	But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could
 50361	not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult
 50362	to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not
 50363	carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been
 50364	discharged, and he had not had time to reload it. âNo matter, the dagger
 50365	will do,â he said to himself, though when planning his design he had
 50366	more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the
 50367	student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as
 50368	his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving
 50369	to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he
 50370	could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a
 50371	green sheath which he had bought at the SÃºkharev market with the pistol,
 50372	and hid it under his waistcoat.
 50373	
 50374	Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,
 50375	Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting
 50376	the captain, and passed out into the street.
 50377	
 50378	The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the
 50379	evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on
 50380	fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river,
 50381	in the Bazaar and the PovarskÃ³y, as well as the barges on the MoskvÃ¡
 50382	River and the timber yards by the DorogomÃ­lov Bridge, were all ablaze.
 50383	
 50384	Pierreâs way led through side streets to the PovarskÃ³y and from there
 50385	to the church of St. Nicholas on the ArbÃ¡t, where he had long before
 50386	decided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses
 50387	were locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted.
 50388	The air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met
 50389	Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of
 50390	the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both
 50391	the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his
 50392	height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his
 50393	face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they could
 50394	not make out to what class he could belong. The French followed him with
 50395	astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the
 50396	other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no
 50397	attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who were
 50398	explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them,
 50399	stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.
 50400	
 50401	Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel
 50402	standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout
 50403	was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the manâs musket as
 50404	he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side
 50405	of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around
 50406	him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like
 50407	something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous nightâs
 50408	experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring
 50409	his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by
 50410	anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out,
 50411	for Napoleon had passed the ArbÃ¡t more than four hours previously on his
 50412	way from the DorogomÃ­lov suburb to the KrÃ©mlin, and was now sitting in
 50413	a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the KrÃ©mlin, giving
 50414	detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately
 50415	to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the
 50416	inhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed
 50417	in what lay before him, and was torturedâas those are who obstinately
 50418	undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its
 50419	difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their naturesâby the
 50420	fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.
 50421	
 50422	Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct
 50423	and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the PovarskÃ³y.
 50424	
 50425	As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denserâhe
 50426	even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose
 50427	from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets
 50428	and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something
 50429	unusual was happening around him, did not realize that he was
 50430	approaching the fire. As he was going along a footpath across a
 50431	wide-open space adjoining the PovarskÃ³y on one side and the gardens
 50432	of Prince GruzÃ­nskiâs house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the
 50433	desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening
 50434	from a dream and lifted his head.
 50435	
 50436	By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household
 50437	goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the
 50438	ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,
 50439	prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman,
 50440	swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two
 50441	girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks,
 50442	were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale
 50443	frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an
 50444	overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his
 50445	old nurseâs arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk,
 50446	and, having undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight
 50447	and sniffing at her singed hair. The womanâs husband, a short,
 50448	round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, with
 50449	sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair
 50450	smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless face was
 50451	moving the trunks, which were placed one on another, and was dragging
 50452	some garments from under them.
 50453	
 50454	As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.
 50455	
 50456	âDear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help
 50457	us, somebody,â she muttered between her sobs. âMy girl... My daughter!
 50458	My youngest daughter is left behind. Sheâs burned! Ooh! Was it for this
 50459	I nursed you.... Ooh!â
 50460	
 50461	âDonât, Mary NikolÃ¡evna!â said her husband to her in a low voice,
 50462	evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. âSister must have
 50463	taken her, or else where can she be?â he added.
 50464	
 50465	âMonster! Villain!â shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep.
 50466	âYou have no heart, you donât feel for your own child! Another man would
 50467	have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a
 50468	man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,â she went on,
 50469	addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. âThe fire broke out
 50470	alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out âFire!â and we rushed
 50471	to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we
 50472	have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost.
 50473	We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...â and again she
 50474	began to sob. âMy child, my dear one! Burned, burned!â
 50475	
 50476	âBut where was she left?â asked Pierre.
 50477	
 50478	From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man
 50479	might help her.
 50480	
 50481	âOh, dear sir!â she cried, seizing him by the legs. âMy benefactor, set
 50482	my heart at ease.... AnÃ­ska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!â she
 50483	cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing
 50484	her long teeth.
 50485	
 50486	âShow me the way, show me, I... Iâll do it,â gasped Pierre rapidly.
 50487	
 50488	The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait,
 50489	sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt
 50490	as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head
 50491	higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps
 50492	he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the PovarskÃ³y. The
 50493	whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here
 50494	and there broke through that cloud. A great number of people crowded in
 50495	front of the conflagration. In the middle of the street stood a French
 50496	general saying something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the
 50497	maid, was advancing to the spot where the general stood, but the French
 50498	soldiers stopped him.
 50499	
 50500	âOn ne passe pas!â * cried a voice.
 50501	
 50502	    * âYou canât pass!â
 50503	
 50504	
 50505	âThis way, uncle,â cried the girl. âWeâll pass through the side street,
 50506	by the NikÃºlinsâ!â
 50507	
 50508	Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her.
 50509	She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and,
 50510	passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.
 50511	
 50512	âItâs here, close by,â said she and, running across the yard, opened a
 50513	gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden
 50514	wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its
 50515	sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from
 50516	the openings of the windows and from under the roof.
 50517	
 50518	As Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and
 50519	involuntarily stopped.
 50520	
 50521	âWhich is it? Which is your house?â he asked.
 50522	
 50523	âOoh!â wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. âThatâs it, that was our
 50524	lodging. Youâve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little
 50525	missy! Ooh!â lamented AnÃ­ska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she
 50526	too must give expression to her feelings.
 50527	
 50528	Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he
 50529	involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house
 50530	that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around
 50531	which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize
 50532	what these men, who were dragging something out, were about; but seeing
 50533	before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying
 50534	to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was
 50535	going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.
 50536	
 50537	The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the
 50538	whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and
 50539	the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds
 50540	and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense
 50541	sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along
 50542	the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced
 50543	on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a
 50544	peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt
 50545	himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt
 50546	young, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of
 50547	the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still
 50548	standing, when just above his head he heard several voices shouting
 50549	and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close
 50550	beside him.
 50551	
 50552	Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen
 50553	who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal
 50554	articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.
 50555	
 50556	âWhat does this fellow want?â shouted one of them referring to Pierre.
 50557	
 50558	âThereâs a child in that house. Havenât you seen a child?â cried Pierre.
 50559	
 50560	âWhatâs he talking about? Get along!â said several voices, and one of
 50561	the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from
 50562	them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved
 50563	threateningly toward him.
 50564	
 50565	âA child?â shouted a Frenchman from above. âI did hear something
 50566	squealing in the garden. Perhaps itâs his brat that the fellow is
 50567	looking for. After all, one must be human, you know....â
 50568	
 50569	âWhere is it? Where?â said Pierre.
 50570	
 50571	âThere! There!â shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the
 50572	garden at the back of the house. âWait a bitâIâm coming down.â
 50573	
 50574	And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot
 50575	on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the
 50576	ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the
 50577	garden.
 50578	
 50579	âHurry up, you others!â he called out to his comrades. âItâs getting
 50580	hot.â
 50581	
 50582	When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled
 50583	Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a
 50584	three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.
 50585	
 50586	âThere is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!â said the
 50587	Frenchman. âGood-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you
 50588	know!â and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his
 50589	comrades.
 50590	
 50591	Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take
 50592	her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking
 50593	child, unattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away.
 50594	Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed
 50595	desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierreâs
 50596	hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized
 50597	by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when
 50598	touching some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw
 50599	the child down and ran with her to the large house. It was now, however,
 50600	impossible to get back the way he had come; the maid, AnÃ­ska, was no
 50601	longer there, and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the
 50602	wet, painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran
 50603	with her through the garden seeking another way out.

 50609	CHAPTER XXXIV
 50610	
 50611	Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back
 50612	with his little burden to the GruzÃ­nski garden at the corner of the
 50613	PovarskÃ³y. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set
 50614	out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods
 50615	that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian families who
 50616	had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings, there were
 50617	several French soldiers in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice
 50618	of them. He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to
 50619	restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre
 50620	felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the
 50621	heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever
 50622	the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him
 50623	when he ran to save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging
 50624	with her little hands to Pierreâs coat, sat on his arm gazing about
 50625	her like some little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a
 50626	slight smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that
 50627	frightened, sickly little face.
 50628	
 50629	He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He
 50630	walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he
 50631	met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family
 50632	consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new,
 50633	cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar
 50634	type, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the
 50635	perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched,
 50636	black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long,
 50637	beautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the
 50638	crowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright
 50639	lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out
 50640	onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old
 50641	woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless, large,
 50642	almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she was aware
 50643	of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre and,
 50644	hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at her.
 50645	When he had reached the fence, still without finding those he sought, he
 50646	stopped and looked about him.
 50647	
 50648	With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than
 50649	before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.
 50650	
 50651	âHave you lost anyone, my dear fellow? Youâre of the gentry yourself,
 50652	arenât you? Whose child is it?â they asked him.
 50653	
 50654	Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who
 50655	had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether
 50656	anyone knew where she had gone.
 50657	
 50658	âWhy, that must be the AnfÃ©rovs,â said an old deacon, addressing a
 50659	pockmarked peasant woman. âLord have mercy, Lord have mercy!â he added
 50660	in his customary bass.
 50661	
 50662	âThe AnfÃ©rovs? No,â said the woman. âThey left in the morning. That must
 50663	be either Mary NikolÃ¡evnaâs or the IvÃ¡novsâ!â
 50664	
 50665	âHe says âa woman,â and Mary NikolÃ¡evna is a lady,â remarked a house
 50666	serf.
 50667	
 50668	âDo you know her? Sheâs thin, with long teeth,â said Pierre.
 50669	
 50670	âThatâs Mary NikolÃ¡evna! They went inside the garden when these wolves
 50671	swooped down,â said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.
 50672	
 50673	âO Lord, have mercy!â added the deacon.
 50674	
 50675	âGo over that way, theyâre there. Itâs she! She kept on lamenting and
 50676	crying,â continued the woman. âItâs she. Here, this way!â
 50677	
 50678	But Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been
 50679	intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at
 50680	the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them.
 50681	One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round
 50682	the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were
 50683	bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a
 50684	long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements
 50685	and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a womanâs loose gown
 50686	of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The little
 50687	barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and,
 50688	saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old
 50689	man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in the frieze gown
 50690	stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in
 50691	his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.
 50692	
 50693	âHere, take the child!â said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the
 50694	woman, handing the little girl to her. âGive her back to them, give her
 50695	back!â he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the
 50696	ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.
 50697	
 50698	The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had
 50699	secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other.
 50700	The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre
 50701	caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the
 50702	Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to
 50703	side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his
 50704	pockets had seized her by the neck.
 50705	
 50706	The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude,
 50707	with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the
 50708	soldier was doing to her.
 50709	
 50710	While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the
 50711	Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing
 50712	from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young
 50713	woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.
 50714	
 50715	âLet that woman alone!â exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice,
 50716	seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.
 50717	
 50718	The soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down
 50719	the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.
 50720	
 50721	âVoyons, pas de bÃªtises!â * he cried.
 50722	
 50723	    * âLook here, no nonsense!â
 50724	
 50725	
 50726	Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and
 50727	his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman
 50728	and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his
 50729	feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard
 50730	from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French
 50731	Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to
 50732	Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing
 50733	of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and
 50734	being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a
 50735	crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him.
 50736	
 50737	âLieutenant, he has a dagger,â were the first words Pierre understood.
 50738	
 50739	âAh, a weapon?â said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier
 50740	who had been arrested with Pierre. âAll right, you can tell all about it
 50741	at the court-martial.â Then he turned to Pierre. âDo you speak French?â
 50742	
 50743	Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His
 50744	face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in
 50745	a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on
 50746	both sides of Pierre.
 50747	
 50748	âDo you speak French?â the officer asked again, keeping at a distance
 50749	from Pierre. âCall the interpreter.â
 50750	
 50751	A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and
 50752	by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a
 50753	French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.
 50754	
 50755	âHe does not look like a common man,â said the interpreter, after a
 50756	searching look at Pierre.
 50757	
 50758	âAh, he looks very much like an incendiary,â remarked the officer. âAnd
 50759	ask him who he is,â he added.
 50760	
 50761	âWho are you?â asked the interpreter in poor Russian. âYou must answer
 50762	the chief.â
 50763	
 50764	âI will not tell you who I am. I am your prisonerâtake me!â Pierre
 50765	suddenly replied in French.
 50766	
 50767	âAh, ah!â muttered the officer with a frown. âWell then, march!â
 50768	
 50769	A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the
 50770	pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol
 50771	started she moved forward.
 50772	
 50773	âWhere are they taking you to, you poor dear?â said she. âAnd the little
 50774	girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if sheâs not theirs?â
 50775	said the woman.
 50776	
 50777	âWhat does that woman want?â asked the officer.
 50778	
 50779	Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight of the
 50780	little girl he had saved.
 50781	
 50782	âWhat does she want?â he murmured. âShe is bringing me my daughter whom
 50783	I have just saved from the flames,â said he. âGood-by!â And without
 50784	knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along with
 50785	resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.
 50786	
 50787	The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various
 50788	streets of Moscow by Durosnelâs order to put a stop to the pillage,
 50789	and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general
 50790	opinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers,
 50791	were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through a number
 50792	of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects: a small
 50793	shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house serf, besides
 50794	several looters. But of all these various suspected characters, Pierre
 50795	was considered to be the most suspicious of all. When they had all been
 50796	brought for the night to a large house on the ZÃºbov Rampart that was
 50797	being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed apart under strict guard.

 50809	CHAPTER I
 50810	
 50811	In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on
 50812	with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between the parties
 50813	of RumyÃ¡ntsev, the French, MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna, the TsarÃ©vich, and others,
 50814	drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm,
 50815	luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and
 50816	reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made it hard,
 50817	except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the difficult
 50818	position of the Russian people. There were the same receptions and
 50819	balls, the same French theater, the same court interests and service
 50820	interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the very highest circles were
 50821	attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position.
 50822	Stories were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved
 50823	in these difficult circumstances. The Empress MÃ¡rya, concerned for
 50824	the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her
 50825	patronage, had given directions that they should all be removed to
 50826	KazÃ¡n, and the things belonging to these institutions had already been
 50827	packed up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions
 50828	she would be pleased to giveâwith her characteristic Russian patriotism
 50829	had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions
 50830	for that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally
 50831	was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.
 50832	
 50833	At Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of the
 50834	battle of BorodinÃ³, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which was
 50835	to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending
 50836	the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a model
 50837	of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince VasÃ­li himself, famed for
 50838	his elocution, was to read it. (He used to read at the Empressâ.) The
 50839	art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite
 50840	independently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating
 50841	between a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell
 50842	quite at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading,
 50843	as was always the case at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs soirees, had a political
 50844	significance. That evening she expected several important personages who
 50845	had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused
 50846	to a patriotic temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna
 50847	PÃ¡vlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room,
 50848	did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general
 50849	conversation.
 50850	
 50851	The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess BezÃºkhova.
 50852	She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed
 50853	several gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said
 50854	to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors
 50855	who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor
 50856	who was treating her in some new and unusual way.
 50857	
 50858	They all knew very well that the enchanting countessâ illness arose from
 50859	an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time,
 50860	and that the Italianâs cure consisted in removing such inconvenience;
 50861	but in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs presence no one dared to think of this or even
 50862	appear to know it.
 50863	
 50864	âThey say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina
 50865	pectoris.â
 50866	
 50867	âAngina? Oh, thatâs a terrible illness!â
 50868	
 50869	âThey say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...â and
 50870	the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.
 50871	
 50872	âThe count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor
 50873	told him the case was dangerous.â
 50874	
 50875	âOh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.â
 50876	
 50877	âYou are speaking of the poor countess?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, coming
 50878	up just then. âI sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little
 50879	better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the world,â she
 50880	went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. âWe belong to different
 50881	camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She
 50882	is very unfortunate!â added Anna PÃ¡vlovna.
 50883	
 50884	Supposing that by these words Anna PÃ¡vlovna was somewhat lifting the
 50885	veil from the secret of the countessâ malady, an unwary young man
 50886	ventured to express surprise that well-known doctors had not been called
 50887	in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might
 50888	employ dangerous remedies.
 50889	
 50890	âYour information may be better than mine,â Anna PÃ¡vlovna suddenly and
 50891	venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, âbut I know on good
 50892	authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He is private
 50893	physician to the Queen of Spain.â
 50894	
 50895	And having thus demolished the young man, Anna PÃ¡vlovna turned to
 50896	another group where BilÃ­bin was talking about the Austrians: having
 50897	wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again
 50898	and utter one of his mots.
 50899	
 50900	âI think it is delightful,â he said, referring to a diplomatic note that
 50901	had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the
 50902	French by Wittgenstein, âthe hero of Petropolâ as he was then called in
 50903	Petersburg.
 50904	
 50905	âWhat? Whatâs that?â asked Anna PÃ¡vlovna, securing silence for the mot,
 50906	which she had heard before.
 50907	
 50908	And BilÃ­bin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, which
 50909	he had himself composed.
 50910	
 50911	âThe Emperor returns these Austrian banners,â said BilÃ­bin, âfriendly
 50912	banners gone astray and found on a wrong path,â and his brow became
 50913	smooth again.
 50914	
 50915	âCharming, charming!â observed Prince VasÃ­li.
 50916	
 50917	âThe path to Warsaw, perhaps,â Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and
 50918	unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant.
 50919	Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise. He knew no
 50920	more than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career
 50921	he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very
 50922	witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words
 50923	that entered his head. âIt may turn out very well,â he thought, âbut
 50924	if not, theyâll know how to arrange matters.â And really, during the
 50925	awkward silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic person
 50926	entered whom Anna PÃ¡vlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert,
 50927	and she, smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince
 50928	VasÃ­li to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript
 50929	begged him to begin. Everyone became silent.
 50930	
 50931	âMost Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!â Prince VasÃ­li sternly declaimed,
 50932	looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had
 50933	anything to say to the contrary. But no one said anything. âMoscow, our
 50934	ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives her Christââhe placed a
 50935	sudden emphasis on the word herââas a mother receives her zealous sons
 50936	into her arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant
 50937	glory of thy rule, sings in exultation, âHosanna, blessed is he that
 50938	cometh!ââ
 50939	
 50940	Prince VasÃ­li pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.
 50941	
 50942	BilÃ­bin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present
 50943	appeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna
 50944	PÃ¡vlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman
 50945	muttering the prayer at Communion: âLet the bold and insolent
 50946	Goliath...â she whispered.
 50947	
 50948	Prince VasÃ­li continued.
 50949	
 50950	âLet the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass
 50951	the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling
 50952	of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty
 50953	pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and
 50954	zealous champion of old of our countryâs weal, is offered to Your
 50955	Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing
 50956	in the sight of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to
 50957	Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully
 50958	fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.â
 50959	
 50960	âWhat force! What a style!â was uttered in approval both of reader and
 50961	of author.
 50962	
 50963	Animated by that address Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs guests talked for a long time
 50964	of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the
 50965	result of the battle to be fought in a few days.
 50966	
 50967	âYou will see,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, âthat tomorrow, on the Emperorâs
 50968	birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!â
 50969	
 50970	
 50971

 50974	CHAPTER II
 50975	
 50976	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day during the
 50977	service at the palace church in honor of the Emperorâs birthday, Prince
 50978	VolkÃ³nski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from
 50979	Prince KutÃºzov. It was KutÃºzovâs report, written from TatÃ¡rinova on the
 50980	day of the battle. KutÃºzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a
 50981	step, that the French losses were much heavier than ours, and that he
 50982	was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full
 50983	information. It followed that there must have been a victory. And at
 50984	once, without leaving the church, thanks were rendered to the Creator
 50985	for His help and for the victory.
 50986	
 50987	Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâs presentiment was justified, and all that morning a
 50988	joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory
 50989	to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleonâs having been
 50990	captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for
 50991	France.
 50992	
 50993	It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength
 50994	and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the
 50995	scene of action. General events involuntarily group themselves around
 50996	some particular incident. So now the courtiersâ pleasure was based as
 50997	much on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperorâs birthday as
 50998	on the fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged
 50999	surprise. Mention was made in KutÃºzovâs report of the Russian losses,
 51000	among which figured the names of TÃºchkov, BagratiÃ³n, and KutÃ¡ysov. In
 51001	the Petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily
 51002	centered round a single incident: KutÃ¡ysovâs death. Everybody knew
 51003	him, the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. That day
 51004	everyone met with the words:
 51005	
 51006	âWhat a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss
 51007	KutÃ¡ysov is! How sorry I am!â
 51008	
 51009	âWhat did I tell about KutÃºzov?â Prince VasÃ­li now said with a
 51010	prophetâs pride. âI always said he was the only man capable of defeating
 51011	Napoleon.â
 51012	
 51013	But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew
 51014	anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense
 51015	occasioned the Emperor.
 51016	
 51017	âFancy the Emperorâs position!â said they, and instead of extolling
 51018	KutÃºzov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause
 51019	of the Emperorâs anxiety. That day Prince VasÃ­li no longer boasted of
 51020	his protÃ©gÃ© KutÃºzov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was
 51021	mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make
 51022	Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was
 51023	added. Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne BezÃºkhova had suddenly died of that terrible
 51024	malady it had been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large
 51025	gatherings, everyone said that Countess BezÃºkhova had died of a
 51026	terrible attack of angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details
 51027	were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had
 51028	prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect;
 51029	but HÃ©lÃ¨ne, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and
 51030	that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate
 51031	Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the
 51032	drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her.
 51033	It was said that Prince VasÃ­li and the old count had turned upon the
 51034	Italian, but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate
 51035	deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop.
 51036	
 51037	Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperorâs
 51038	lack of news, the loss of KutÃ¡ysov, and the death of HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 51039	
 51040	On the third day after KutÃºzovâs report a country gentleman arrived from
 51041	Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through
 51042	the whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor to
 51043	be in! KutÃºzov was a traitor, and Prince VasÃ­li during the visits of
 51044	condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughterâs death said of
 51045	KutÃºzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his
 51046	grief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect
 51047	anything else from a blind and depraved old man.
 51048	
 51049	âI only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such
 51050	a man.â
 51051	
 51052	As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it,
 51053	but the next day the following communication was received from Count
 51054	RostopchÃ­n:
 51055	
 51056	Prince KutÃºzovâs adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands
 51057	police officers to guide the army to the RyazÃ¡n road. He writes that
 51058	he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! KutÃºzovâs action decides the
 51059	fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will shudder to learn of
 51060	the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in
 51061	which lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall follow the army. I have
 51062	had everything removed, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate
 51063	of my fatherland.
 51064	
 51065	On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince VolkÃ³nski to KutÃºzov
 51066	with the following rescript:
 51067	
 51068	Prince Michael IlariÃ³novich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have
 51069	received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I
 51070	received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via YaroslÃ¡vl, the sad
 51071	news that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can
 51072	yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence
 51073	increases my astonishment. I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince
 51074	VolkÃ³nski, to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons
 51075	that have induced you to take this melancholy decision.
 51076	
 51077	
 51078	
 51079	
 51080	
 51081	CHAPTER III
 51082	
 51083	Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from KutÃºzov
 51084	reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event. This
 51085	messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know Russian, but who was
 51086	quoique Ã©tranger, russe de cÅur et dâÃ¢me, * as he said of himself.
 51087	
 51088	    * Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.
 51089	
 51090	The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace
 51091	on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before the campaign
 51092	and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as he wrote) when
 51093	he appeared before notre trÃ¨s gracieux souverain * with the news of the
 51094	burning of Moscow, dont les flammes Ã©clairaient sa route. *(2)
 51095	
 51096	     * Our most gracious sovereign.
 51097	
 51098	     * (2) Whose flames illumined his route.
 51099	
 51100	Though the source of M. Michaudâs chagrin must have been different from
 51101	that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when shown
 51102	into the Emperorâs study that the latter at once asked:
 51103	
 51104	âHave you brought me sad news, Colonel?â
 51105	
 51106	âVery sad, sire,â replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh. âThe
 51107	abandonment of Moscow.â
 51108	
 51109	âHave they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?â asked the
 51110	Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.
 51111	
 51112	Michaud respectfully delivered the message KutÃºzov had entrusted to him,
 51113	which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that
 51114	as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as
 51115	Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the
 51116	latter.
 51117	
 51118	The Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.
 51119	
 51120	âHas the enemy entered the city?â he asked.
 51121	
 51122	âYes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,â
 51123	replied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he was
 51124	frightened by what he had done.
 51125	
 51126	The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip
 51127	trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.
 51128	
 51129	But this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming
 51130	himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a
 51131	firm voice:
 51132	
 51133	âI see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires
 51134	great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in all things to
 51135	His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the army when it
 51136	saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did you not notice
 51137	discouragement?...â
 51138	
 51139	Seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also
 51140	grew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperorâs
 51141	direct and relevant question which required a direct answer.
 51142	
 51143	âSire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?â he
 51144	asked to gain time.
 51145	
 51146	âColonel, I always require it,â replied the Emperor. âConceal nothing
 51147	from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.â
 51148	
 51149	âSire!â said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on his
 51150	lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, âsire, I left the
 51151	whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in
 51152	desperate and agonized terror...â
 51153	
 51154	âHow is that?â the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. âWould
 51155	misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!â
 51156	
 51157	Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had
 51158	prepared.
 51159	
 51160	âSire,â he said, with respectful playfulness, âthey are only afraid lest
 51161	Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be
 51162	persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the combat,â declared this
 51163	representative of the Russian nation, âand to prove to Your Majesty by
 51164	the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are....â
 51165	
 51166	âAh!â said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes,
 51167	he patted Michaud on the shoulder. âYou set me at ease, Colonel.â
 51168	
 51169	He bent his head and was silent for some time.
 51170	
 51171	âWell, then, go back to the army,â he said, drawing himself up to his
 51172	full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture,
 51173	âand tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that
 51174	when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my
 51175	beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of
 51176	my empire. It still offers me more than my enemies suppose,â said the
 51177	Emperor growing more and more animated; âbut should it ever be ordained
 51178	by Divine Providence,â he continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes
 51179	shining with emotion, âthat my dynasty should cease to reign on the
 51180	throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting all the means at my
 51181	command, I shall let my beard grow to hereâ (he pointed halfway down his
 51182	chest) âand go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants, rather
 51183	than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose
 51184	sacrifices I know how to appreciate.â
 51185	
 51186	Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly
 51187	turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,
 51188	and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few
 51189	moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow
 51190	with a vigorous movement. The Emperorâs mild and handsome face was
 51191	flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.
 51192	
 51193	âColonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may
 51194	recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I,â said the Emperor,
 51195	touching his breast. âWe can no longer both reign together. I have
 51196	learned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more....â
 51197	
 51198	And the Emperor paused, with a frown.
 51199	
 51200	When he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in
 51201	the Emperorâs eyes, Michaudâquoique Ã©tranger, russe de cÅur et dâÃ¢me,âat
 51202	that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard (as
 51203	he used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his own feelings and
 51204	those of the Russian people whose representative he considered himself
 51205	to be, in the following words:
 51206	
 51207	âSire!â said he, âYour Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of
 51208	the nation and the salvation of Europe!â
 51209	
 51210	With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.
 51211	
 51212	
 51213	
 51214	
 51215	
 51216	CHAPTER IV
 51217	
 51218	It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that
 51219	when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to
 51220	distant provinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the
 51221	defense of the fatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least
 51222	were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland,
 51223	or weeping over its downfall. The tales and descriptions of that time
 51224	without exception speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion,
 51225	despair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really
 51226	so. It appears so to us because we see only the general historic
 51227	interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests
 51228	that people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment
 51229	so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the
 51230	public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at
 51231	that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were
 51232	guided only by their private interests, and they were the very people
 51233	whose activities at that period were most useful.
 51234	
 51235	Those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take
 51236	part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members
 51237	of society, they saw everything upside down, and all they did for the
 51238	common good turned out to be useless and foolishâlike Pierreâs and
 51239	MamÃ³novâs regiments which looted Russian villages, and the lint the
 51240	young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded, and so on.
 51241	Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings,
 51242	who discussed Russiaâs position at the time involuntarily introduced
 51243	into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or
 51244	useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of
 51245	actions no one could possibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule
 51246	forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially
 51247	applicable. Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part
 51248	in an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to
 51249	realize it his efforts are fruitless.
 51250	
 51251	The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in
 51252	Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and
 51253	in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in
 51254	militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of
 51255	self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow
 51256	there was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight
 51257	of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they
 51258	thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of MatrÃ«shka the
 51259	vivandiÃ¨re, and like matters.
 51260	
 51261	As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas RostÃ³v took a close
 51262	and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually,
 51263	without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was
 51264	going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his
 51265	brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the state of
 51266	Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to think about
 51267	it, that KutÃºzov and others were there for that purpose, but that he had
 51268	heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that
 51269	fighting would probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being
 51270	so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple
 51271	of yearsâ time.
 51272	
 51273	As he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being
 51274	sent to VorÃ³nezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without
 51275	regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but
 51276	with the greatest pleasureâwhich he did not conceal and which his
 51277	comrades fully understood.
 51278	
 51279	A few days before the battle of BorodinÃ³, Nicholas received the
 51280	necessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in
 51281	advance, he set out with post horses for VorÃ³nezh.
 51282	
 51283	Only a man who has experienced itâthat is, has passed some months
 51284	continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and warâcan understand the
 51285	delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the
 51286	armyâs foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. Whenâfree
 51287	from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a campâhe saw villages
 51288	with peasants and peasant women, gentlemenâs country houses, fields
 51289	where cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in
 51290	them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time. What for
 51291	a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young
 51292	and healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women,
 51293	too, who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke
 51294	with them.
 51295	
 51296	In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in VorÃ³nezh,
 51297	ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and next day, very
 51298	clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long
 51299	time, went to present himself to the authorities.
 51300	
 51301	The commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man who was
 51302	evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He received
 51303	Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military)
 51304	and questioned him with an important air, as if considering the general
 51305	progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do
 51306	so. Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him.
 51307	
 51308	From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The governor
 51309	was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated the stud
 51310	farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a horse
 51311	dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had
 51312	the best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.
 51313	
 51314	âYou are Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³vâs son? My wife was a great friend of your
 51315	motherâs. We are at home on Thursdaysâtoday is Thursday, so please come
 51316	and see us quite informally,â said the governor, taking leave of him.
 51317	
 51318	Immediately on leaving the governorâs, Nicholas hired post horses and,
 51319	taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the
 51320	landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to
 51321	him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in VorÃ³nezh
 51322	and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind,
 51323	everything went well and easily.
 51324	
 51325	The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a
 51326	horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy
 51327	and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who
 51328	owned some splendid horses.
 51329	
 51330	In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six
 51331	thousand rublesâto serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts. After
 51332	dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine, Nicholasâhaving
 51333	exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was already on the
 51334	friendliest termsâgalloped back over abominable roads, in the brightest
 51335	frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for
 51336	the governorâs party.
 51337	
 51338	When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself,
 51339	Nicholas arrived at the governorâs rather late, but with the phrase
 51340	âbetter late than neverâ on his lips.
 51341	
 51342	It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew
 51343	that Catherine PetrÃ³vna would play valses and the Ã©cossaise on the
 51344	clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as
 51345	to a ball.
 51346	
 51347	Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this
 51348	difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the
 51349	arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that
 51350	went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an
 51351	âin for a penny, in for a poundâwho cares?â spirit, and the inevitable
 51352	small talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances,
 51353	now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.
 51354	
 51355	The society gathered together at the governorâs was the best in
 51356	VorÃ³nezh.
 51357	
 51358	There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholasâ Moscow
 51359	acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the
 51360	cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured
 51361	and well-bred Count RostÃ³v. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an
 51362	officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that
 51363	prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian
 51364	was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him
 51365	that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he treated him
 51366	cordially though with dignity and restraint.
 51367	
 51368	As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him
 51369	a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words âbetter late
 51370	than neverâ and heard them repeated several times by others, people
 51371	clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once
 51372	that he had entered into his proper position in the provinceâthat of
 51373	a universal favorite: a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so
 51374	after his long privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in the
 51375	landownerâs snuggery, maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and
 51376	here too at the governorâs party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas)
 51377	an inexhaustible number of pretty young women, married and unmarried,
 51378	impatiently awaiting his notice. The women and girls flirted with him
 51379	and, from the first day, the people concerned themselves to get this
 51380	fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these
 51381	was the governorâs wife herself, who welcomed RostÃ³v as a near relative
 51382	and called him âNicholas.â
 51383	
 51384	Catherine PetrÃ³vna did actually play valses and the Ã©cossaise, and
 51385	dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial
 51386	society by his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even
 51387	surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he
 51388	danced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would
 51389	even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in
 51390	bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by
 51391	something unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular
 51392	thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces.
 51393	
 51394	All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and
 51395	pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.
 51396	With the naÃ¯ve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other menâs
 51397	wives were created for them, RostÃ³v did not leave the ladyâs side and
 51398	treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if,
 51399	without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady
 51400	would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem to share that
 51401	conviction and tried to behave morosely with RostÃ³v. But the
 51402	latterâs good-natured naÃ¯vetÃ© was so boundless that sometimes even he
 51403	involuntarily yielded to Nicholasâ good humor. Toward the end of the
 51404	evening, however, as the wifeâs face grew more flushed and animated, the
 51405	husbandâs became more and more melancholy and solemn, as though there
 51406	were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wifeâs
 51407	share increased the husbandâs diminished.
 51408

 51412	
 51413	CHAPTER V
 51414	
 51415	Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely
 51416	over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a
 51417	smile that never left his face. Jauntily shifting the position of his
 51418	legs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and
 51419	admiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines of his legs in
 51420	their well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he
 51421	wished to run away with a certain lady here in VorÃ³nezh.
 51422	
 51423	âWhich lady?â
 51424	
 51425	âA charming lady, a divine one. Her eyesâ (Nicholas looked at his
 51426	partner) âare blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figureâ (he glanced
 51427	at her shoulders) âlike Dianaâs....â
 51428	
 51429	The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking
 51430	about.
 51431	
 51432	âAh, NikÃ­ta IvÃ¡nych!â cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing
 51433	NikÃ­ta IvÃ¡nych to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention
 51434	to elope with a blonde lady.
 51435	
 51436	The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governorâs good-natured
 51437	wife came up with a look of disapproval.
 51438	
 51439	âAnna IgnÃ¡tyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,â said she, pronouncing the
 51440	name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna IgnÃ¡tyevna was a very
 51441	important person. âCome, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?â
 51442	
 51443	âOh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?â
 51444	
 51445	âAnna IgnÃ¡tyevna MalvÃ­ntseva. She has heard from her niece how you
 51446	rescued her.... Can you guess?â
 51447	
 51448	âI rescued such a lot of them!â said Nicholas.
 51449	
 51450	âHer niece, Princess BolkÃ³nskaya. She is here in VorÃ³nezh with her aunt.
 51451	Oho! How you blush. Why, are...?â
 51452	
 51453	âNot a bit! Please donât, Aunt!â
 51454	
 51455	âVery well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!â
 51456	
 51457	The governorâs wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with
 51458	a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most
 51459	important personages of the town. This was MalvÃ­ntseva, Princess Maryâs
 51460	aunt on her motherâs side, a rich, childless widow who always lived in
 51461	VorÃ³nezh. When RostÃ³v approached her she was standing settling up for
 51462	the game. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued
 51463	to upbraid the general who had won from her.
 51464	
 51465	âVery pleased, mon cher,â she then said, holding out her hand to
 51466	Nicholas. âPray come and see me.â
 51467	
 51468	After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom
 51469	MalvÃ­ntseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas
 51470	knew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the
 51471	important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to
 51472	come to see her.
 51473	
 51474	Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention
 51475	of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear,
 51476	which he himself did not understand.
 51477	
 51478	When he had parted from MalvÃ­ntseva Nicholas wished to return to the
 51479	dancing, but the governorâs little wife placed her plump hand on his
 51480	sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to
 51481	her sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew
 51482	so as not to be in her way.
 51483	
 51484	âDo you know, dear boy,â began the governorâs wife with a serious
 51485	expression on her kind little face, âthat really would be the match for
 51486	you: would you like me to arrange it?â
 51487	
 51488	âWhom do you mean, Aunt?â asked Nicholas.
 51489	
 51490	âI will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine PetrÃ³vna
 51491	speaks of Lily, but I say, noâthe princess! Do you want me to do it? I
 51492	am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl she is,
 51493	really! And she is not at all so plain, either.â
 51494	
 51495	âNot at all,â replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. âAs befits
 51496	a soldier, Aunt, I donât force myself on anyone or refuse anything,â he
 51497	said before he had time to consider what he was saying.
 51498	
 51499	âWell then, remember, this is not a joke!â
 51500	
 51501	âOf course not!â
 51502	
 51503	âYes, yes,â the governorâs wife said as if talking to herself. âBut,
 51504	my dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the
 51505	blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....â
 51506	
 51507	âOh no, we are good friends with him,â said Nicholas in the simplicity
 51508	of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to
 51509	himself might not be pleasant to someone else.
 51510	
 51511	âBut what nonsense I have been saying to the governorâs wife!â thought
 51512	Nicholas suddenly at supper. âShe will really begin to arrange a
 51513	match... and SÃ³nya...?â And on taking leave of the governorâs wife,
 51514	when she again smilingly said to him, âWell then, remember!â he drew her
 51515	aside.
 51516	
 51517	âBut see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...â
 51518	
 51519	âWhat is it, my dear? Come, letâs sit down here,â said she.
 51520	
 51521	Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
 51522	thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or
 51523	his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwards
 51524	recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which
 51525	had very important results for him, it seemed to himâas it seems to
 51526	everyone in such casesâthat it was merely some silly whim that seized
 51527	him: yet that burst of frankness, together with other trifling events,
 51528	had immense consequences for him and for all his family.
 51529	
 51530	âYou see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the
 51531	very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.â
 51532	
 51533	âOh yes, I understand,â said the governorâs wife.
 51534	
 51535	âBut Princess BolkÃ³nskayaâthatâs another matter. I will tell you the
 51536	truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; and
 51537	then, after I met her under such circumstancesâso strangely, the idea
 51538	often occurred to me: âThis is fate.â Especially if you remember that
 51539	Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her
 51540	before, somehow it had always happened that we did not meet. And as long
 51541	as my sister NatÃ¡sha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of
 51542	the question for me to think of marrying her. And it must needs happen
 51543	that I should meet her just when NatÃ¡shaâs engagement had been broken
 51544	off... and then everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone
 51545	and never will, only to you.â
 51546	
 51547	The governorâs wife pressed his elbow gratefully.
 51548	
 51549	âYou know SÃ³nya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her, and
 51550	will do so.... So you see there can be no question aboutââ said Nicholas
 51551	incoherently and blushing.
 51552	
 51553	âMy dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know SÃ³nya has nothing and
 51554	you yourself say your Papaâs affairs are in a very bad way. And what
 51555	about your mother? It would kill her, thatâs one thing. And what sort of
 51556	life would it be for SÃ³nyaâif sheâs a girl with a heart? Your mother
 51557	in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and SÃ³nya ought to
 51558	understand that.â
 51559	
 51560	Nicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.
 51561	
 51562	âAll the same, Aunt, it is impossible,â he rejoined with a sigh, after
 51563	a short pause. âBesides, would the princess have me? And besides, she is
 51564	now in mourning. How can one think of it!â
 51565	
 51566	âBut you donât suppose Iâm going to get you married at once? There is
 51567	always a right way of doing things,â replied the governorâs wife.
 51568	
 51569	âWhat a matchmaker you are, Aunt...â said Nicholas, kissing her plump
 51570	little hand.
 51571	
 51572	
 51573	
 51574	
 51575	
 51576	CHAPTER VI
 51577	
 51578	On reaching Moscow after her meeting with RostÃ³v, Princess Mary had
 51579	found her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince Andrew
 51580	giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt MalvÃ­ntseva at VorÃ³nezh.
 51581	That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her
 51582	fatherâs illness, since his death, and especially since her meeting with
 51583	RostÃ³v was smothered by arrangements for the journey, anxiety about her
 51584	brother, settling in a new house, meeting new people, and attending to
 51585	her nephewâs education. She was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet
 51586	surroundings, she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which
 51587	was associated in her mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and
 51588	incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother,
 51589	the only intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was
 51590	worried too about her nephewâs education for which she had always felt
 51591	herself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peaceâa
 51592	peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams
 51593	and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were
 51594	related to her meeting with RostÃ³v.
 51595	
 51596	The day after her party the governorâs wife came to see MalvÃ­ntseva
 51597	and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though
 51598	under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be
 51599	thought of, all the same the young people might be brought together and
 51600	could get to know one another. MalvÃ­ntseva expressed approval, and the
 51601	governorâs wife began to speak of RostÃ³v in Maryâs presence, praising
 51602	him and telling how he had blushed when Princess Maryâs name was
 51603	mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful
 51604	feelingâher mental tranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts,
 51605	self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.
 51606	
 51607	During the two days that elapsed before RostÃ³v called, Princess Mary
 51608	continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she decided
 51609	not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her auntâthat it
 51610	would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors;
 51611	then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then
 51612	it occurred to her that her aunt and the governorâs wife had intentions
 51613	concerning herself and RostÃ³vâtheir looks and words at times seemed to
 51614	confirm this suppositionâthen she told herself that only she, with her
 51615	sinful nature, could think this of them: they could not forget that
 51616	situated as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking
 51617	would be an insult to her and to her fatherâs memory. Assuming that she
 51618	did go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say
 51619	to her and what she would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed
 51620	undeservedly cold and then to mean too much. More than anything she
 51621	feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as
 51622	soon as she saw him.
 51623	
 51624	But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
 51625	room that Count RostÃ³v had called, the princess showed no confusion,
 51626	only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
 51627	and radiant light.
 51628	
 51629	âYou have met him, Aunt?â said she in a calm voice, unable herself to
 51630	understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.
 51631	
 51632	When RostÃ³v entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an
 51633	instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then
 51634	just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with
 51635	shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose
 51636	with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him,
 51637	and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep
 51638	womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing
 51639	room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise. Herself a
 51640	consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a
 51641	man she wished to attract.
 51642	
 51643	âEither black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly
 51644	improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what tact and
 51645	grace!â thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 51646	
 51647	Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would
 51648	have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that
 51649	had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized that dear,
 51650	loved face, a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to
 51651	speak and act apart from her own will. From the time RostÃ³v entered, her
 51652	face became suddenly transformed. It was as if a light had been kindled
 51653	in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic
 51654	work on its sides, that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless,
 51655	was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first
 51656	time all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had
 51657	lived appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction
 51658	with herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her
 51659	meekness, love, and self-sacrificeâall this now shone in those radiant
 51660	eyes, in her delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.
 51661	
 51662	RostÃ³v saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He
 51663	felt that the being before him was quite different from, and better
 51664	than, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.
 51665	
 51666	Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the
 51667	war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow
 51668	about it; they spoke of their last meetingâNicholas trying to change the
 51669	subjectâthey talked of the governorâs kind wife, of Nicholasâ relations,
 51670	and of Princess Maryâs.
 51671	
 51672	She did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon
 51673	as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russiaâs
 51674	misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near
 51675	her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas
 51676	noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Maryâs character
 51677	with an observation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his
 51678	conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being.
 51679	Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the
 51680	princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and even when he thought of
 51681	her, but in her presence he felt quite at ease, and said not at all what
 51682	he had prepared, but what, quite appropriately, occurred to him at the
 51683	moment.
 51684	
 51685	When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when
 51686	there are children, turned to Prince Andrewâs little son, caressing him
 51687	and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on
 51688	his knee, played with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a
 51689	softened, happy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms
 51690	of the man she loved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if
 51691	understanding it, flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with
 51692	good natured playfulness.
 51693	
 51694	As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and
 51695	Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all
 51696	the same the governorâs wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to
 51697	Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice
 51698	versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary. For this
 51699	purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishopâs
 51700	house before Mass.
 51701	
 51702	Though RostÃ³v told the governorâs wife that he would not make any
 51703	declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.
 51704	
 51705	As at Tilsit RostÃ³v had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody
 51706	considered right was right, so now, after a short but sincere struggle
 51707	between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice, and
 51708	in obedient submission to circumstances, he chose the latter and yielded
 51709	to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where. He
 51710	knew that after his promise to SÃ³nya it would be what he deemed base to
 51711	declare his feelings to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never
 51712	act basely. But he also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart)
 51713	that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those
 51714	who were guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing
 51715	something very importantâmore important than anything he had ever done
 51716	in his life.
 51717	
 51718	After meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on
 51719	externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him
 51720	and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he
 51721	had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met
 51722	in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously,
 51723	thought about SÃ³nya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as
 51724	almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife,
 51725	adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life:
 51726	a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his wifeâs carriage,
 51727	little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to her, and so onâand these
 51728	pictures of the future had given him pleasure. But with Princess Mary,
 51729	to whom they were trying to get him engaged, he could never picture
 51730	anything of future married life. If he tried, his pictures seemed
 51731	incongruous and false. It made him afraid.

 51737	CHAPTER VII
 51738	
 51739	The dreadful news of the battle of BorodinÃ³, of our losses in killed and
 51740	wounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached
 51741	VorÃ³nezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having learned of
 51742	her brotherâs wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of
 51743	him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her again himself) to
 51744	set off in search of Prince Andrew.
 51745	
 51746	When he received the news of the battle of BorodinÃ³ and the abandonment
 51747	of Moscow, RostÃ³v was not seized with despair, anger, the desire for
 51748	vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but everything in VorÃ³nezh
 51749	suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and he experienced an
 51750	indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The conversations he heard
 51751	seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs
 51752	and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear
 51753	to him. He made haste to finish buying the horses, and often became
 51754	unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster.
 51755	
 51756	A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which
 51757	Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory.
 51758	He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military
 51759	decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects.
 51760	When the service was over the governorâs wife beckoned him to her.
 51761	
 51762	âHave you seen the princess?â she asked, indicating with a movement of
 51763	her head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond the choir.
 51764	
 51765	Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile
 51766	he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, timidity, and
 51767	pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary, evidently engrossed
 51768	by her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last time before leaving
 51769	the church.
 51770	
 51771	Nicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he had
 51772	seen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner,
 51773	spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There was a
 51774	pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had occurred
 51775	before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her without waiting to
 51776	be prompted by the governorâs wife and not asking himself whether or not
 51777	it was right and proper to address her here in church, and told her he
 51778	had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as
 51779	she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both
 51780	her sorrow and her joy.
 51781	
 51782	âThere is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,â said RostÃ³v. âIt
 51783	is that if your brother, Prince Andrew NikolÃ¡evich, were not living, it
 51784	would have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he is a colonel.â
 51785	
 51786	The princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered
 51787	by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.
 51788	
 51789	âAnd I have known so many cases of a splinter woundâ (the Gazette said
 51790	it was a shell) âeither proving fatal at once or being very slight,â
 51791	continued Nicholas. âWe must hope for the best, and I am sure...â
 51792	
 51793	Princess Mary interrupted him.
 51794	
 51795	âOh, that would be so dread...â she began and, prevented by agitation
 51796	from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as
 51797	everything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully,
 51798	went out, following her aunt.
 51799	
 51800	That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some
 51801	accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that business it
 51802	was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed,
 51803	and for a long time he paced up and down the room, reflecting on his
 51804	life, a thing he rarely did.
 51805	
 51806	Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met
 51807	her in SmolÃ©nsk province. His having encountered her in such exceptional
 51808	circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as
 51809	a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her. When he met her
 51810	again in VorÃ³nezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing
 51811	but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he
 51812	observed in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and
 51813	it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself
 51814	of chances of meeting her. But that dayâs encounter in church had, he
 51815	felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale,
 51816	sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures,
 51817	and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features
 51818	agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men RostÃ³v could not bear to
 51819	see the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not
 51820	like Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy
 51821	and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed
 51822	the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible
 51823	attraction.
 51824	
 51825	âShe must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!â he said to himself.
 51826	âWhy am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with SÃ³nya?â And he
 51827	involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and
 51828	the abundance of it in the otherâa spirituality he himself lacked and
 51829	therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were
 51830	he free. How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife.
 51831	But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture
 51832	presented itself to his mind. He had long ago pictured to himself a
 51833	future with SÃ³nya, and that was all clear and simple just because it
 51834	had all been thought out and he knew all there was in SÃ³nya, but it was
 51835	impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary, because he did not
 51836	understand her but simply loved her.
 51837	
 51838	Reveries about SÃ³nya had had something merry and playful in them, but to
 51839	dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening.
 51840	
 51841	âHow she prayed!â he thought. âIt was plain that her whole soul was in
 51842	her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am
 51843	sure her prayer will be answered. Why donât I pray for what I want?â he
 51844	suddenly thought. âWhat do I want? To be free, released from SÃ³nya...
 51845	She was right,â he thought, remembering what the governorâs wife had
 51846	said: âNothing but misfortune can come of marrying SÃ³nya. Muddles,
 51847	grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles!
 51848	Besides, I donât love herânot as I should. O, God! release me from
 51849	this dreadful, inextricable position!â he suddenly began to pray. âYes,
 51850	prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not pray as
 51851	NatÃ¡sha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn into
 51852	sugarâand then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so. No,
 51853	but I am not praying for trifles now,â he thought as he put his pipe
 51854	down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself before the icon.
 51855	Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not
 51856	done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the
 51857	door opened and LavrÃºshka came in with some papers.
 51858	
 51859	âBlockhead! Why do you come in without being called?â cried Nicholas,
 51860	quickly changing his attitude.
 51861	
 51862	âFrom the governor,â said LavrÃºshka in a sleepy voice. âA courier has
 51863	arrived and thereâs a letter for you.â
 51864	
 51865	âWell, all right, thanks. You can go!â
 51866	
 51867	Nicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and
 51868	the other from SÃ³nya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened
 51869	SÃ³nyaâs first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his
 51870	eyes opened wide with fear and joy.
 51871	
 51872	âNo, itâs not possible!â he cried aloud.
 51873	
 51874	Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and
 51875	reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again,
 51876	and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders,
 51877	stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed.
 51878	What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear
 51879	him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were
 51880	something extraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it
 51881	had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he
 51882	had prayed, but by some ordinary coincidence.
 51883	
 51884	This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter
 51885	from SÃ³nya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which
 51886	there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last unfortunate
 51887	eventsâthe loss of almost the whole of the RostÃ³vsâ Moscow propertyâand
 51888	the countessâ repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry
 51889	Princess BolkÃ³nskaya, together with his silence and coldness of late,
 51890	had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and
 51891	set him completely free.
 51892	
 51893	It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow
 51894	or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my
 51895	love has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I
 51896	beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of
 51897	everything, no one can love you more than does
 51898	
 51899	Your SÃ³nya
 51900	
 51901	Both letters were written from TrÃ³itsa. The other, from the countess,
 51902	described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and
 51903	the destruction of all their property. In this letter the countess also
 51904	mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them;
 51905	his state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more
 51906	hope. SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha were nursing him.
 51907	
 51908	Next day Nicholas took his motherâs letter and went to see Princess
 51909	Mary. Neither he nor she said a word about what âNatÃ¡sha nursing himâ
 51910	might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as
 51911	intimate with the princess as if they were relations.
 51912	
 51913	The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to YaroslÃ¡vl,
 51914	and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.
 51915	
 51916	
 51917	
 51918	
 51919	
 51920	CHAPTER VIII
 51921	
 51922	SÃ³nyaâs letter written from TrÃ³itsa, which had come as an answer to
 51923	Nicholasâ prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas
 51924	married to an heiress occupied the old countessâ mind more and more. She
 51925	knew that SÃ³nya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and SÃ³nyaâs
 51926	life in the countessâ house had grown harder and harder, especially
 51927	after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting
 51928	with Princess Mary in BoguchÃ¡rovo. The countess let no occasion slip of
 51929	making humiliating or cruel allusions to SÃ³nya.
 51930	
 51931	But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that
 51932	was going on, she called SÃ³nya to her and, instead of reproaching and
 51933	making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself
 51934	and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
 51935	engagement with Nicholas.
 51936	
 51937	âI shall not be at peace till you promise me this.â
 51938	
 51939	SÃ³nya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that
 51940	she would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave no actual
 51941	promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded
 51942	of her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and
 51943	brought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was SÃ³nyaâs habit. Her
 51944	position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her
 51945	worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her
 51946	former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they
 51947	raised her in her own esteem and in that of others, and so made her more
 51948	worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world. But
 51949	now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the
 51950	whole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life.
 51951	And for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been
 51952	her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous
 51953	of NatÃ¡sha who had never experienced anything of this sort, had never
 51954	needed to sacrifice herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for
 51955	her and yet was beloved by everybody. And for the first time SÃ³nya felt
 51956	that out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling
 51957	was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue,
 51958	or religion. Under the influence of this feeling SÃ³nya, whose life of
 51959	dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered
 51960	the countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and
 51961	resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him
 51962	free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.
 51963	
 51964	The bustle and terror of the RostÃ³vsâ last days in Moscow stifled the
 51965	gloomy thoughts that oppressed SÃ³nya. She was glad to find escape
 51966	from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrewâs
 51967	presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for
 51968	NatÃ¡sha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God
 51969	did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that NatÃ¡sha
 51970	loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him. She
 51971	knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances
 51972	they would again fall in love with one another, and that Nicholas would
 51973	then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the
 51974	prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror of what had
 51975	happened during those last days and during the first days of their
 51976	journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal
 51977	affairs cheered SÃ³nya.
 51978	
 51979	At the TrÃ³itsa monastery the RostÃ³vs first broke their journey for a
 51980	whole day.
 51981	
 51982	Three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, one
 51983	of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much better
 51984	that day and NatÃ¡sha was sitting with him. In the next room sat the
 51985	count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was
 51986	calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.
 51987	SÃ³nya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and
 51988	NatÃ¡sha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices through
 51989	the door. That door opened and NatÃ¡sha came out, looking excited. Not
 51990	noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the
 51991	wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to SÃ³nya and took her hand.
 51992	
 51993	âNatÃ¡sha, what are you about? Come here!â said the countess.
 51994	
 51995	NatÃ¡sha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray
 51996	for aid to God and His saint.
 51997	
 51998	As soon as the prior withdrew, NatÃ¡sha took her friend by the hand and
 51999	went with her into the unoccupied room.
 52000	
 52001	âSÃ³nya, will he live?â she asked. âSÃ³nya, how happy I am, and how
 52002	unhappy!... SÃ³nya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he
 52003	lives! He cannot... because... because... of...â and NatÃ¡sha burst into
 52004	tears.
 52005	
 52006	âYes! I knew it! Thank God!â murmured SÃ³nya. âHe will live.â
 52007	
 52008	SÃ³nya was not less agitated than her friend by the latterâs fear and
 52009	grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.
 52010	Sobbing, she kissed and comforted NatÃ¡sha. âIf only he lives!â she
 52011	thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two
 52012	friends went together to Prince Andrewâs door. NatÃ¡sha opened it
 52013	cautiously and glanced into the room, SÃ³nya standing beside her at the
 52014	half-open door.
 52015	
 52016	Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale face was
 52017	calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular breathing.
 52018	
 52019	âO, NatÃ¡sha!â SÃ³nya suddenly almost screamed, catching her companionâs
 52020	arm and stepping back from the door.
 52021	
 52022	âWhat? What is it?â asked NatÃ¡sha.
 52023	
 52024	âItâs that, that...â said SÃ³nya, with a white face and trembling lips.
 52025	
 52026	NatÃ¡sha softly closed the door and went with SÃ³nya to the window, not
 52027	yet understanding what the latter was telling her.
 52028	
 52029	âYou remember,â said SÃ³nya with a solemn and frightened expression.
 52030	âYou remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at OtrÃ¡dnoe at
 52031	Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?â
 52032	
 52033	âYes, yes!â cried NatÃ¡sha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely recalling
 52034	that SÃ³nya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom she had seen
 52035	lying down.
 52036	
 52037	âYou remember?â SÃ³nya went on. âI saw it then and told everybody, you
 52038	and DunyÃ¡sha. I saw him lying on a bed,â said she, making a gesture with
 52039	her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, âand that he had his eyes
 52040	closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were
 52041	folded,â she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just
 52042	seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror.
 52043	
 52044	She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that
 52045	came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now
 52046	as real as any other recollection. She not only remembered what she had
 52047	then saidâthat he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with
 52048	something redâbut was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said
 52049	that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.
 52050	
 52051	âYes, yes, it really was pink!â cried NatÃ¡sha, who now thought she
 52052	too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most
 52053	extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.
 52054	
 52055	âBut what does it mean?â she added meditatively.
 52056	
 52057	âOh, I donât know, it is all so strange,â replied SÃ³nya, clutching at
 52058	her head.
 52059	
 52060	A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and NatÃ¡sha went to him, but
 52061	SÃ³nya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the window
 52062	thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.
 52063	
 52064	
 52065	They had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and the
 52066	countess was writing to her son.
 52067	
 52068	âSÃ³nya!â said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as her
 52069	niece passed, âSÃ³nya, wonât you write to Nicholas?â She spoke in a soft,
 52070	tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles
 52071	SÃ³nya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words. Those
 52072	eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and
 52073	readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.
 52074	
 52075	SÃ³nya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.
 52076	
 52077	âYes, Mamma, I will write,â said she.
 52078	
 52079	SÃ³nya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that
 52080	day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her
 52081	vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of NatÃ¡shaâs relations with
 52082	Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she
 52083	was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in
 52084	which she was accustomed to live and loved to live. So with a joyful
 52085	consciousness of performing a magnanimous deedâinterrupted several times
 52086	by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyesâshe wrote that touching
 52087	letter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas.

 52093	CHAPTER IX
 52094	
 52095	The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with
 52096	hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was taken.
 52097	In their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as
 52098	to who he might beâperhaps a very important personâand hostility as a
 52099	result of their recent personal conflict with him.
 52100	
 52101	But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the
 52102	new guardâboth officers and menâhe was not as interesting as he had
 52103	been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not
 52104	recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person
 52105	who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had
 52106	uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only
 52107	No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason
 52108	by order of the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable
 52109	about Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative concentration
 52110	and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as
 52111	surprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the
 52112	other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was
 52113	required by an officer.
 52114	
 52115	All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and,
 52116	recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as
 52117	he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.
 52118	
 52119	That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among
 52120	them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken
 52121	with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache
 52122	sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms.
 52123	With the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners,
 52124	and which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others
 52125	was questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object,
 52126	and so on.
 52127	
 52128	These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the
 52129	essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that essenceâs
 52130	being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel through which
 52131	the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to
 52132	the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say
 52133	anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and
 52134	the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused
 52135	always feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were
 52136	put to him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a
 52137	kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. He
 52138	knew he was in these menâs power, that only by force had they brought
 52139	him there, that force alone gave them the right to demand answers
 52140	to their questions, and that the sole object of that assembly was to
 52141	inculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate
 52142	him, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. It was
 52143	evident that any answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he
 52144	was doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner
 52145	that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the
 52146	flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he âwas
 52147	protecting a woman,â and that âto protect a woman who was being insulted
 52148	was the duty of every man; that...â They interrupted him, for this
 52149	was not to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where
 52150	witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what
 52151	was happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked
 52152	where he was going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they
 52153	asked, repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer.
 52154	Again he replied that he could not answer it.
 52155	
 52156	âPut that down, thatâs bad... very bad,â sternly remarked the general
 52157	with the white mustache and red flushed face.
 52158	
 52159	
 52160	On the fourth day fires broke out on the ZÃºbovski rampart.
 52161	
 52162	Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchantâs
 52163	house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the streets Pierre
 52164	felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole
 52165	city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize the
 52166	significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires with
 52167	horror.
 52168	
 52169	He passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and
 52170	during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that all
 52171	those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day
 52172	from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn from the
 52173	soldiers. Evidently for them âthe marshalâ represented a very high and
 52174	rather mysterious power.
 52175	
 52176	These first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were
 52177	had up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre.
 52178	
 52179	
 52180	
 52181	
 52182	
 52183	CHAPTER X
 52184	
 52185	On the eighth of September an officerâa very important one judging by
 52186	the respect the guards showed himâentered the coach house where the
 52187	prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding
 52188	a paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming
 52189	Pierre as âthe man who does not give his name.â Glancing indolently and
 52190	indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge
 52191	to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the
 52192	marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with
 52193	thirteen others was led to the Virginâs Field. It was a fine day, sunny
 52194	after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low
 52195	as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the
 52196	ZÃºbovski rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns. No flames
 52197	were seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far
 52198	as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin. On all sides there were
 52199	waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and
 52200	here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed
 52201	at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well. Here and
 52202	there he could see churches that had not been burned. The KrÃ©mlin, which
 52203	was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and
 52204	the belfry of IvÃ¡n the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin
 52205	glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.
 52206	These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the
 52207	Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this
 52208	holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to be
 52209	seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw
 52210	the French.
 52211	
 52212	It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in
 52213	place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre
 52214	unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been
 52215	established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of
 52216	the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were
 52217	escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the looks of an
 52218	important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier,
 52219	whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental
 52220	music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt and realized
 52221	it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out
 52222	when he came that morning. Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers
 52223	and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men,
 52224	and it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused him with
 52225	the others. But no: the answers he had given when questioned had come
 52226	back to him in his designation as âthe man who does not give his name,â
 52227	and under that appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were
 52228	now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces
 52229	that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted
 52230	and that they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself
 52231	to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose
 52232	action he did not understand but which was working well.
 52233	
 52234	He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virginâs
 52235	Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the
 52236	convent. This was Prince ShcherbÃ¡tovâs house, where Pierre had often
 52237	been in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the
 52238	soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of EckmÃ¼hl (Davout).
 52239	
 52240	They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.
 52241	Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery,
 52242	an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low
 52243	study at the door of which stood an adjutant.
 52244	
 52245	Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of
 52246	the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting
 52247	a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes,
 52248	he said in a low voice:
 52249	
 52250	âWho are you?â
 52251	
 52252	Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him
 52253	Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for his
 52254	cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster
 52255	who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every
 52256	instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what
 52257	to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first
 52258	examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and
 52259	embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had decided what to do,
 52260	Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back on his forehead,
 52261	screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.
 52262	
 52263	âI know that man,â he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently
 52264	calculated to frighten Pierre.
 52265	
 52266	The chill that had been running down Pierreâs back now seized his head
 52267	as in a vise.
 52268	
 52269	âYou cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...â
 52270	
 52271	âHe is a Russian spy,â Davout interrupted, addressing another general
 52272	who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.
 52273	
 52274	Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre
 52275	rapidly began:
 52276	
 52277	âNo, monseigneur,â he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke.
 52278	âNo, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia officer and
 52279	have not quitted Moscow.â
 52280	
 52281	âYour name?â asked Davout.
 52282	
 52283	âBezÃºkhov.â
 52284	
 52285	âWhat proof have I that you are not lying?â
 52286	
 52287	âMonseigneur!â exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading
 52288	voice.
 52289	
 52290	Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked
 52291	at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war
 52292	and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At
 52293	that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their
 52294	minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and
 52295	were brothers.
 52296	
 52297	At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the
 52298	papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre
 52299	was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without
 52300	burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a
 52301	human being. He reflected for a moment.
 52302	
 52303	âHow can you show me that you are telling the truth?â said Davout
 52304	coldly.
 52305	
 52306	Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the
 52307	street where the house was.
 52308	
 52309	âYou are not what you say,â returned Davout.
 52310	
 52311	In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the
 52312	truth of his statements.
 52313	
 52314	But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout.
 52315	
 52316	Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began
 52317	buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.
 52318	
 52319	When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in
 52320	Pierreâs direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But
 52321	where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house
 52322	or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as
 52323	they crossed the Virginâs Field.
 52324	
 52325	He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another
 52326	question to Davout.
 52327	
 52328	âYes, of course!â replied Davout, but what this âyesâ meant, Pierre did
 52329	not know.
 52330	
 52331	Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or
 52332	in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied,
 52333	and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others
 52334	did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his
 52335	mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to
 52336	death? Not the men on the commission that had first examined himânot one
 52337	of them wished to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout,
 52338	who had looked at him in so human a way. In another moment Davout would
 52339	have realized that he was doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had
 52340	come in and interrupted him. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no
 52341	evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in. Then who was
 52342	executing him, killing him, depriving him of lifeâhim, Pierre, with all
 52343	his memories, aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And
 52344	Pierre felt that it was no one.
 52345	
 52346	It was a systemâa concurrence of circumstances.
 52347	
 52348	A system of some sort was killing himâPierreâdepriving him of life, of
 52349	everything, annihilating him.
 52350	
 52351	
 52352	
 52353	
 52354	
 52355	CHAPTER XI
 52356	
 52357	From Prince ShcherbÃ¡tovâs house the prisoners were led straight down the
 52358	Virginâs Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden
 52359	in which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been
 52360	dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood
 52361	in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many
 52362	of Napoleonâs soldiers who were not on dutyâGermans, Italians, and
 52363	Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of the post
 52364	stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high
 52365	boots and shakos.
 52366	
 52367	The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list
 52368	(Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly
 52369	began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as
 52370	if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of thinking or
 52371	understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only one wishâthat
 52372	the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre
 52373	looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.
 52374	
 52375	The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin,
 52376	the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was
 52377	a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a
 52378	plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome
 52379	man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a
 52380	factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat.
 52381	
 52382	Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or
 52383	two at a time. âIn couples,â replied the officer in command in a calm
 52384	voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident
 52385	that they were all hurryingânot as men hurry to do something they
 52386	understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and
 52387	incomprehensible task.
 52388	
 52389	A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of
 52390	prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.
 52391	
 52392	Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the
 52393	officerâs command took the two convicts who stood first in the row. The
 52394	convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being
 52395	brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching
 52396	huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other scratched his back
 52397	and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands
 52398	the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and
 52399	bound them to the post.
 52400	
 52401	Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm
 52402	regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned away
 52403	to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling
 52404	noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific
 52405	thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen
 52406	were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands.
 52407	Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks,
 52408	these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for
 52409	protection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe
 52410	what was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because they
 52411	alone knew what their life meant to them, and so they neither understood
 52412	nor believed that it could be taken from them.
 52413	
 52414	Again Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again the
 52415	sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the same moment
 52416	he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who
 52417	were again doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding
 52418	one another. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what
 52419	it meant. The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.
 52420	
 52421	On the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and officers
 52422	without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict that
 52423	were in his own heart. âBut who, after all, is doing this? They are all
 52424	suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?â flashed for an instant through
 52425	his mind.
 52426	
 52427	âSharpshooters of the 86th, forward!â shouted someone. The fifth
 52428	prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led awayâalone. Pierre did not
 52429	understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought
 52430	there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror, and no
 52431	sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place. The fifth man
 52432	was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid hands on
 52433	him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered
 52434	and shook himself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him
 52435	along, holding him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got
 52436	him to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something.
 52437	Whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought
 52438	it incredible that men should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at
 52439	the post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded
 52440	animal looked around him with glittering eyes.
 52441	
 52442	Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity
 52443	and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch
 52444	at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he
 52445	wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.
 52446	
 52447	When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which
 52448	hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against the
 52449	bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that
 52450	position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again
 52451	more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss
 52452	his slightest movement.
 52453	
 52454	Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of
 52455	eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember
 52456	having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the
 52457	workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood showed
 52458	itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the
 52459	hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally
 52460	and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered
 52461	him. Pale, frightened people were doing something around the workman.
 52462	The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he
 52463	untied the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awkwardly
 52464	from the post and began pushing it into the pit.
 52465	
 52466	They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must
 52467	hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.
 52468	
 52469	Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with
 52470	his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other.
 52471	That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls
 52472	of earth were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the
 52473	soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to
 52474	go back. But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post,
 52475	and no one drove him away.
 52476	
 52477	When the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was taken
 52478	back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post
 52479	made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The twenty-four
 52480	sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the
 52481	circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed by.
 52482	
 52483	Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in
 52484	couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. This
 52485	one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and
 52486	his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the spot
 52487	from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps
 52488	forward and back to save himself from falling. An old, noncommissioned
 52489	officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to
 52490	his company. The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse. They
 52491	all went away silently and with drooping heads.
 52492	
 52493	âThat will teach them to start fires,â said one of the Frenchmen.
 52494	
 52495	Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who
 52496	was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was not
 52497	able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a
 52498	hopeless movement with his arm and went away.
 52499	
 52500	
 52501	
 52502	
 52503	
 52504	CHAPTER XII
 52505	
 52506	After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners
 52507	and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.
 52508	
 52509	Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and
 52510	told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for
 52511	the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him, Pierre
 52512	got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of the
 52513	field, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams,
 52514	and battens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty
 52515	different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding
 52516	who they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He heard
 52517	what they said, but did not understand the meaning of the words and
 52518	made no kind of deduction from or application of them. He replied to
 52519	questions they put to him, but did not consider who was listening to his
 52520	replies, nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces
 52521	and figures, but they all seemed to him equally meaningless.
 52522	
 52523	From the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by
 52524	men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspring of
 52525	his life, on which everything depended and which made everything appear
 52526	alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed
 52527	into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowledge it to
 52528	himself, his faith in the right ordering of the universe, in humanity,
 52529	in his own soul, and in God, had been destroyed. He had experienced this
 52530	before, but never so strongly as now. When similar doubts had assailed
 52531	him before, they had been the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the
 52532	bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from
 52533	those doubts was to be found within himself. But now he felt that
 52534	the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins
 52535	remained, and this not by any fault of his own. He felt that it was not
 52536	in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life.
 52537	
 52538	Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
 52539	about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and
 52540	asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he
 52541	found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and
 52542	talking on all sides.
 52543	
 52544	âWell, then, mates... that very prince who...â some voice at the other
 52545	end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word who.
 52546	
 52547	Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,
 52548	Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as
 52549	he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory
 52550	ladâespecially dreadful because of its simplicityâand the faces of the
 52551	murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened
 52552	his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him.
 52553	
 52554	Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he
 52555	was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from
 52556	him every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the
 52557	darkness, and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man
 52558	continually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw
 52559	that the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused
 52560	Pierreâs interest.
 52561	
 52562	Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully
 52563	coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up
 52564	at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already
 52565	unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully
 52566	removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following
 52567	one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs
 52568	fixed above his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed
 52569	the knife, placed it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself
 52570	comfortably, clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes
 52571	on Pierre. The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting,
 52572	and well-rounded in these deft movements, in the manâs well-ordered
 52573	arrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at
 52574	the man without taking his eyes from him.
 52575	
 52576	âYouâve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?â the little man suddenly said.
 52577	
 52578	And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice
 52579	that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears
 52580	rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray
 52581	his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant tones:
 52582	
 52583	âEh, lad, donât fret!â said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice
 52584	old Russian peasant women employ. âDonât fret, friendââsuffer an hour,
 52585	live for an age!â thatâs how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live,
 52586	thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are good
 52587	men as well as bad,â said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees
 52588	with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of
 52589	the shed.
 52590	
 52591	âEh, you rascal!â Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other
 52592	end of the shed. âSo youâve come, you rascal? She remembers... Now, now,
 52593	thatâll do!â
 52594	
 52595	And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at
 52596	him, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something
 52597	wrapped in a rag.
 52598	
 52599	âHere, eat a bit, sir,â said he, resuming his former respectful tone as
 52600	he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. âWe had soup for
 52601	dinner and the potatoes are grand!â
 52602	
 52603	Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed
 52604	extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.
 52605	
 52606	âWell, are they all right?â said the soldier with a smile. âYou should
 52607	do like this.â
 52608	
 52609	He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two
 52610	equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the
 52611	rag, and handed it to Pierre.
 52612	
 52613	âThe potatoes are grand!â he said once more. âEat some like that!â
 52614	
 52615	Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.
 52616	
 52617	âOh, Iâm all right,â said he, âbut why did they shoot those poor
 52618	fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.â
 52619	
 52620	âTss, tt...!â said the little man. âAh, what a sin... what a sin!â he
 52621	added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his
 52622	mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: âHow was it, sir, that you
 52623	stayed in Moscow?â
 52624	
 52625	âI didnât think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,â replied
 52626	Pierre.
 52627	
 52628	âAnd how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?â
 52629	
 52630	âNo, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried
 52631	me as an incendiary.â
 52632	
 52633	âWhere thereâs law thereâs injustice,â put in the little man.
 52634	
 52635	âAnd have you been here long?â Pierre asked as he munched the last of
 52636	the potato.
 52637	
 52638	âI? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.â
 52639	
 52640	âWhy, are you a soldier then?â
 52641	
 52642	âYes, we are soldiers of the Ãpsheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We
 52643	werenât told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had
 52644	no idea, never guessed at all.â
 52645	
 52646	âAnd do you feel sad here?â Pierre inquired.
 52647	
 52648	âHow can one help it, lad? My name is PlatÃ³n, and the surname is
 52649	KaratÃ¡ev,â he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to
 52650	address him. âThey call me âlittle falconâ in the regiment. How is one
 52651	to help feeling sad? Moscowâsheâs the mother of cities. How can one see
 52652	all this and not feel sad? But âthe maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies
 52653	firstâ; thatâs what the old folks used to tell us,â he added rapidly.
 52654	
 52655	âWhat? What did you say?â asked Pierre.
 52656	
 52657	âWho? I?â said KaratÃ¡ev. âI say things happen not as we plan but as God
 52658	judges,â he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said
 52659	before, and immediately continued:
 52660	
 52661	âWell, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have
 52662	abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still
 52663	living?â he asked.
 52664	
 52665	And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed
 52666	smile of kindliness puckered the soldierâs lips as he put these
 52667	questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that
 52668	he had no mother.
 52669	
 52670	âA wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but thereâs none as
 52671	dear as oneâs own mother!â said he. âWell, and have you little ones?â he
 52672	went on asking.
 52673	
 52674	Again Pierreâs negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened
 52675	to add:
 52676	
 52677	âNever mind! Youâre young folks yet, and please God may still have some.
 52678	The great thing is to live in harmony....â
 52679	
 52680	âBut itâs all the same now,â Pierre could not help saying.
 52681	
 52682	âAh, my dear fellow!â rejoined KaratÃ¡ev, ânever decline a prison or a
 52683	beggarâs sack!â
 52684	
 52685	He seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently preparing to
 52686	tell a long story.
 52687	
 52688	âWell, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,â he began. âWe had
 52689	a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and our
 52690	house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing
 52691	there were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so
 52692	happened...â
 52693	
 52694	And PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev told a long story of how he had gone into someoneâs
 52695	copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, had been
 52696	tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.
 52697	
 52698	âWell, lad,â and a smile changed the tone of his voice, âwe thought it
 52699	was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for
 52700	my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger
 52701	brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife
 52702	behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a
 52703	soldier. I come home on leave and Iâll tell you how it was, I look and
 52704	see that they are living better than before. The yard full of cattle,
 52705	the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the
 52706	youngest, at home. Father, he says, âAll my children are the same to
 52707	me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if PlatÃ³n hadnât
 52708	been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to go.â called us
 52709	all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons.
 52710	âMichael,â he says, âcome here and bow down to his feet; and you, young
 52711	woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down before
 52712	him! Do you understand?â he says. Thatâs how it is, dear fellow. Fate
 52713	looks for a head. But we are always judging, âthatâs not wellâthatâs
 52714	not right!â Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it
 52715	bulges, but when youâve drawn it out itâs empty! Thatâs how it is.â
 52716	
 52717	And PlatÃ³n shifted his seat on the straw.
 52718	
 52719	After a short silence he rose.
 52720	
 52721	âWell, I think you must be sleepy,â said he, and began rapidly crossing
 52722	himself and repeating:
 52723	
 52724	âLord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus
 52725	Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, have
 52726	mercy on us and save us!â he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got
 52727	up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. âThatâs the way.
 52728	Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,â he
 52729	muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.
 52730	
 52731	âWhat prayer was that you were saying?â asked Pierre.
 52732	
 52733	âEh?â murmured PlatÃ³n, who had almost fallen asleep. âWhat was I saying?
 52734	I was praying. Donât you pray?â
 52735	
 52736	âYes, I do,â said Pierre. âBut what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?â
 52737	
 52738	âWell, of course,â replied PlatÃ³n quickly, âthe horsesâ saints. One must
 52739	pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now youâve curled up and got warm,
 52740	you daughter of a bitch!â said KaratÃ¡ev, touching the dog that lay at
 52741	his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.
 52742	
 52743	Sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance
 52744	outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but
 52745	inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but
 52746	lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular snoring
 52747	of PlatÃ³n who lay beside him, and he felt that the world that had been
 52748	shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on
 52749	new and unshakable foundations.
 52750	
 52751	
 52752	
 52753	
 52754	
 52755	CHAPTER XIII
 52756	
 52757	Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined
 52758	in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for
 52759	four weeks.
 52760	
 52761	When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to
 52762	him except PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev, who always remained in his mind a most
 52763	vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian,
 52764	kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn
 52765	the first impression of him, as of something round, was fully confirmed:
 52766	PlatÃ³nâs whole figureâin a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a
 52767	soldierâs cap, and bast shoesâwas round. His head was quite round, his
 52768	back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever
 52769	ready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his
 52770	large, gentle brown eyes were also round.
 52771	
 52772	PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of
 52773	campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not himself
 52774	know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly
 52775	white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he
 52776	laughedâas he often didâwere all sound and good, there was not a gray
 52777	hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression
 52778	of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance.
 52779	
 52780	His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of
 52781	innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief
 52782	peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was
 52783	evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say,
 52784	and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an
 52785	irresistible persuasiveness.
 52786	
 52787	His physical strength and agility during the first days of his
 52788	imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and
 52789	sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: âLord, lay me
 52790	down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!â and every morning on getting
 52791	up, he said: âI lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself.â And
 52792	indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he
 52793	only had to shake himself, to be ready without a momentâs delay for some
 52794	work, just as children are ready to play directly they awake. He could
 52795	do everything, not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed,
 52796	planed, and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed
 52797	himself conversationâof which he was fondâand songs. He did not sing
 52798	like a trained singer who knows he is listened to, but like the birds,
 52799	evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches
 52800	oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were
 52801	always high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his
 52802	face at such times was very serious.
 52803	
 52804	Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to
 52805	have thrown off all that had been forced upon himâeverything military
 52806	and alien to himselfâand had returned to his former peasant habits.
 52807	
 52808	âA soldier on leaveâa shirt outside breeches,â he would say.
 52809	
 52810	He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not
 52811	complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during
 52812	the whole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally
 52813	some old and evidently precious memory of his âChristianâ life, as he
 52814	called his peasant existence. The proverbs, of which his talk was full,
 52815	were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers
 52816	employ, but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so
 52817	insignificant, but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance
 52818	of profound wisdom.
 52819	
 52820	He would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous
 52821	occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he talked well,
 52822	adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which
 52823	Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his talk lay
 52824	in the fact that the commonest eventsâsometimes just such as Pierre
 52825	had witnessed without taking notice of themâassumed in KaratÃ¡evâs a
 52826	character of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the
 52827	soldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same), but
 52828	most of all he liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile
 52829	joyfully when listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word
 52830	or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear
 52831	to himself. KaratÃ¡ev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre
 52832	understood them, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life
 52833	brought him in contact with, particularly with manânot any particular
 52834	man, but those with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his
 52835	comrades, the French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt
 52836	that in spite of KaratÃ¡evâs affectionate tenderness for him (by which
 52837	he unconsciously gave Pierreâs spiritual life its due) he would not have
 52838	grieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in
 52839	the same way toward KaratÃ¡ev.
 52840	
 52841	To all the other prisoners PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev seemed a most ordinary
 52842	soldier. They called him âlittle falconâ or âPlatÃ³sha,â chaffed him
 52843	good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always
 52844	remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded,
 52845	eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.
 52846	
 52847	PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he began
 52848	to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.
 52849	
 52850	Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask him to
 52851	repeat them, but PlatÃ³n could never recall what he had said a moment
 52852	before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of his
 52853	favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in
 52854	it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of it. He
 52855	did not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart from
 52856	their context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation of
 52857	an activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he
 52858	regarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only as
 52859	part of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and actions
 52860	flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance
 52861	exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value or significance
 52862	of any word or deed taken separately.

 52868	CHAPTER XIV
 52869	
 52870	When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the
 52871	RostÃ³vs at YaroslÃ¡vl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her
 52872	auntâs efforts to dissuade herâand not merely to go herself but to take
 52873	her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, possible or
 52874	impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it was her duty,
 52875	not only to herself, to be near her brother who was perhaps dying, but
 52876	to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared
 52877	to set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess
 52878	Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the
 52879	long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.
 52880	
 52881	In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were the
 52882	huge family coach in which she had traveled to VorÃ³nezh, a semiopen
 52883	trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne,
 52884	little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, TÃ­khon, and a
 52885	young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.
 52886	
 52887	The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the
 52888	roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through LÃ­petsk,
 52889	RyazÃ¡n, VladÃ­mir, and ShÃºya was very long and, as post horses were not
 52890	everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near RyazÃ¡n where the French
 52891	were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.
 52892	
 52893	During this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and
 52894	Princess Maryâs servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of
 52895	spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and
 52896	no difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which
 52897	infected her fellow travelers, they approached YaroslÃ¡vl by the end of
 52898	the second week.
 52899	
 52900	The last days of her stay in VorÃ³nezh had been the happiest of her life.
 52901	Her love for RostÃ³v no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her
 52902	whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer
 52903	struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that she loved
 52904	and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to herself
 52905	in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview with
 52906	Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the
 52907	RostÃ³vs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that
 52908	Prince Andrewâs relations with NatÃ¡sha might, if he recovered, be
 52909	renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of
 52910	this.
 52911	
 52912	Yet in spite of that, his relation to herâconsiderate, delicate, and
 52913	lovingânot only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Princess
 52914	Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them
 52915	allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew that she
 52916	loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was
 52917	beloved, and was happy in regard to it.
 52918	
 52919	But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent
 52920	her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that
 52921	spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her
 52922	to give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so
 52923	strong at the moment of leaving VorÃ³nezh that those who saw her off, as
 52924	they looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall
 52925	ill on the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the
 52926	journey, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from
 52927	her grief and gave her strength.
 52928	
 52929	As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the
 52930	journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached YaroslÃ¡vl
 52931	the thought of what might await her thereânot after many days, but that
 52932	very eveningâagain presented itself to her and her agitation increased
 52933	to its utmost limit.
 52934	
 52935	The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the
 52936	RostÃ³vs were staying in YaroslÃ¡vl, and in what condition Prince Andrew
 52937	was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled
 52938	by the terrible pallor of the princessâ face that looked out at him from
 52939	the window.
 52940	
 52941	âI have found out everything, your excellency: the RostÃ³vs are staying
 52942	at the merchant BrÃ³nnikovâs house, in the Square not far from here,
 52943	right above the VÃ³lga,â said the courier.
 52944	
 52945	Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding
 52946	why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her
 52947	brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.
 52948	
 52949	âHow is the prince?â she asked.
 52950	
 52951	âHis excellency is staying in the same house with them.â
 52952	
 52953	âThen he is alive,â thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:
 52954	âHow is he?â
 52955	
 52956	âThe servants say he is still the same.â
 52957	
 52958	What âstill the sameâ might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an
 52959	unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in
 52960	front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head
 52961	and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and
 52962	swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as they were let
 52963	down.
 52964	
 52965	The carriage door was opened. On the left there was waterâa great
 52966	riverâand on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:
 52967	servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as
 52968	it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This was
 52969	SÃ³nya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. âThis way, this way!â said the
 52970	girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found herself in
 52971	the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to
 52972	meet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She embraced
 52973	Princess Mary and kissed her.
 52974	
 52975	âMon enfant!â she muttered, âje vous aime et vous connais depuis
 52976	longtemps.â *
 52977	
 52978	    * âMy child! I love you and have known you a long time.â
 52979	
 52980	
 52981	Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the
 52982	countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly
 52983	knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in
 52984	French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and
 52985	asked: âHow is he?â
 52986	
 52987	âThe doctor says that he is not in danger,â said the countess, but as
 52988	she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a
 52989	contradiction of her words.
 52990	
 52991	âWhere is he? Can I see himâcan I?â asked the princess.
 52992	
 52993	âOne moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?â said the
 52994	countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles.
 52995	âThere will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh, what a
 52996	lovely boy!â
 52997	
 52998	The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where SÃ³nya was
 52999	talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the boy, and
 53000	the old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had changed very
 53001	much since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had been a brisk,
 53002	cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered
 53003	person. While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as
 53004	if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing. After the
 53005	destruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed
 53006	groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to
 53007	feel that there was no longer a place for him in life.
 53008	
 53009	In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, and
 53010	her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they
 53011	should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew,
 53012	the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the
 53013	necessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things which
 53014	she had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it was hard for
 53015	her she was not vexed with these people.
 53016	
 53017	âThis is my niece,â said the count, introducing SÃ³nyaââYou donât know
 53018	her, Princess?â
 53019	
 53020	Princess Mary turned to SÃ³nya and, trying to stifle the hostile
 53021	feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt
 53022	oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far
 53023	from what was in her own heart.
 53024	
 53025	âWhere is he?â she asked again, addressing them all.
 53026	
 53027	âHe is downstairs. NatÃ¡sha is with him,â answered SÃ³nya, flushing. âWe
 53028	have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.â
 53029	
 53030	Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Maryâs eyes. She turned
 53031	away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when
 53032	light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door.
 53033	The princess looked round and saw NatÃ¡sha coming in, almost runningâthat
 53034	NatÃ¡sha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow long
 53035	since.
 53036	
 53037	But hardly had the princess looked at NatÃ¡shaâs face before she realized
 53038	that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a friend.
 53039	She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her shoulder.
 53040	
 53041	As soon as NatÃ¡sha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrewâs bed, heard
 53042	of Princess Maryâs arrival, she softly left his room and hastened to her
 53043	with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary.
 53044	
 53045	There was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the
 53046	drawing roomâthat of loveâboundless love for him, for her, and for all
 53047	that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for others,
 53048	and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them. It was
 53049	plain that at that moment there was in NatÃ¡shaâs heart no thought of
 53050	herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.
 53051	
 53052	Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the
 53053	first glance at NatÃ¡shaâs face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful
 53054	pleasure.
 53055	
 53056	âCome, come to him, Mary,â said NatÃ¡sha, leading her into the other
 53057	room.
 53058	
 53059	Princess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to NatÃ¡sha.
 53060	She felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn
 53061	everything.
 53062	
 53063	âHow...â she began her question but stopped short.
 53064	
 53065	She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.
 53066	NatÃ¡shaâs face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and
 53067	profoundly.
 53068	
 53069	NatÃ¡sha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say
 53070	all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes
 53071	which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible
 53072	not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, NatÃ¡shaâs lips
 53073	twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face
 53074	with her hands she burst into sobs.
 53075	
 53076	Princess Mary understood.
 53077	
 53078	But she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:
 53079	
 53080	âBut how is his wound? What is his general condition?â
 53081	
 53082	âYou, you... will see,â was all NatÃ¡sha could say.
 53083	
 53084	They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off
 53085	crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.
 53086	
 53087	âHow has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When
 53088	did this happen?â Princess Mary inquired.
 53089	
 53090	NatÃ¡sha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish
 53091	condition and the pain he suffered, but at TrÃ³itsa that had passed
 53092	and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also
 53093	passed. When they reached YaroslÃ¡vl the wound had begun to fester
 53094	(NatÃ¡sha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had
 53095	said that the festering might take a normal course. Then fever set in,
 53096	but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.
 53097	
 53098	âBut two days ago this suddenly happened,â said NatÃ¡sha, struggling with
 53099	her sobs. âI donât know why, but you will see what he is like.â
 53100	
 53101	âIs he weaker? Thinner?â asked the princess.
 53102	
 53103	âNo, itâs not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too good, he
 53104	cannot, cannot live, because...â
 53105	
 53106	
 53107	
 53108	
 53109	
 53110	CHAPTER XV
 53111	
 53112	When NatÃ¡sha opened Prince Andrewâs door with a familiar movement and
 53113	let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the
 53114	sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now
 53115	tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at
 53116	him without tears.
 53117	
 53118	The princess understood what NatÃ¡sha had meant by the words: âtwo days
 53119	ago this suddenly happened.â She understood those words to mean that he
 53120	had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs
 53121	of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in
 53122	imagination Andrewâs face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,
 53123	mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore
 53124	affected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender
 53125	words to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and
 53126	that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his
 53127	presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. The sobs
 53128	rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly
 53129	distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his
 53130	features, and then she saw his face and met his gaze.
 53131	
 53132	He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by
 53133	pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand
 53134	he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate
 53135	mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them
 53136	as they entered.
 53137	
 53138	On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Maryâs pace suddenly
 53139	slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She suddenly
 53140	felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and
 53141	eyes.
 53142	
 53143	âBut in what am I to blame?â she asked herself. And his cold, stern look
 53144	replied: âBecause you are alive and thinking of the living, while I...â
 53145	
 53146	In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there
 53147	was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and
 53148	NatÃ¡sha.
 53149	
 53150	He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.
 53151	
 53152	âHow are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?â said he in a voice
 53153	as calm and aloof as his look.
 53154	
 53155	Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror
 53156	into Princess Maryâs heart as the tone of his voice.
 53157	
 53158	âAnd have you brought little Nicholas?â he asked in the same slow, quiet
 53159	manner and with an obvious effort to remember.
 53160	
 53161	âHow are you now?â said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she was
 53162	saying.
 53163	
 53164	âThat, my dear, you must ask the doctor,â he replied, and again making
 53165	an evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips only (his
 53166	words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):
 53167	
 53168	âMerci, chÃ¨re amie, dâÃªtre venue.â *
 53169	
 53170	    * âThank you for coming, my dear.â
 53171	
 53172	
 53173	Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just
 53174	perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now
 53175	understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words, his
 53176	tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could be
 53177	felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world, terrible
 53178	in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he understand
 53179	anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand, not
 53180	because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something
 53181	elseâsomething the living did not and could not understandâand which
 53182	wholly occupied his mind.
 53183	
 53184	âThere, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,â said he,
 53185	breaking the silence and pointing to NatÃ¡sha. âShe looks after me all
 53186	the time.â
 53187	
 53188	Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a
 53189	thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,
 53190	before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he
 53191	could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had
 53192	not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her and
 53193	how could he speak like that in her presence? The only explanation was
 53194	that he was indifferent, because something else, much more important,
 53195	had been revealed to him.
 53196	
 53197	The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off.
 53198	
 53199	âMary came by way of RyazÃ¡n,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 53200	
 53201	Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and only
 53202	after calling her so in his presence did NatÃ¡sha notice it herself.
 53203	
 53204	âReally?â he asked.
 53205	
 53206	âThey told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that...â
 53207	
 53208	NatÃ¡sha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was
 53209	making an effort to listen, but could not do so.
 53210	
 53211	âYes, they say itâs burned,â he said. âItâs a great pity,â and he gazed
 53212	straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers.
 53213	
 53214	âAnd so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?â Prince Andrew suddenly said,
 53215	evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. âHe wrote here that he
 53216	took a great liking to you,â he went on simply and calmly, evidently
 53217	unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for
 53218	living people. âIf you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you
 53219	to get married,â he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having
 53220	found words he had long been seeking.
 53221	
 53222	Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as
 53223	a proof of how far away he now was from everything living.
 53224	
 53225	âWhy talk of me?â she said quietly and glanced at NatÃ¡sha.
 53226	
 53227	NatÃ¡sha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again
 53228	silent.
 53229	
 53230	âAndrew, would you like...â Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling
 53231	voice, âwould you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking
 53232	about you!â
 53233	
 53234	Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but
 53235	Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did
 53236	not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle
 53237	irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last
 53238	means of arousing him.
 53239	
 53240	âYes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?â
 53241	
 53242	When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrewâs room he looked at
 53243	his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else
 53244	was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to
 53245	say to him.
 53246	
 53247	When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her
 53248	brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began
 53249	to cry.
 53250	
 53251	He looked at her attentively.
 53252	
 53253	âIs it about Nicholas?â he asked.
 53254	
 53255	Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping.
 53256	
 53257	âMary, you know the Gosp...â but he broke off.
 53258	
 53259	âWhat did you say?â
 53260	
 53261	âNothing. You mustnât cry here,â he said, looking at her with the same
 53262	cold expression.
 53263	
 53264	
 53265	When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at
 53266	the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With
 53267	a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their
 53268	point of view.
 53269	
 53270	âYes, to them it must seem sad!â he thought. âBut how simple it is.
 53271	
 53272	âThe fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father
 53273	feedeth them,â he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary;
 53274	âbut no, they will take it their own way, they wonât understand! They
 53275	canât understand that all those feelings they prize soâall our feelings,
 53276	all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot
 53277	understand one another,â and he remained silent.
 53278	
 53279	
 53280	Prince Andrewâs little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew
 53281	nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge,
 53282	observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he
 53283	afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more profound
 53284	understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between
 53285	his father, Mary, and NatÃ¡sha, than he had then. He understood it
 53286	completely, and, leaving the room without crying, went silently up
 53287	to NatÃ¡sha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his
 53288	beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled
 53289	and leaning his head against her he began to cry.
 53290	
 53291	After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and
 53292	either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to NatÃ¡sha of whom
 53293	he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them quietly and
 53294	shyly.
 53295	
 53296	When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what
 53297	NatÃ¡shaâs face had told her. She did not speak any more to NatÃ¡sha of
 53298	hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside his sofa, and
 53299	did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in soul to that
 53300	Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the dying man was now so
 53301	evident.
 53302

 53306	
 53307	CHAPTER XVI
 53308	
 53309	Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he was
 53310	dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an aloofness from
 53311	everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence.
 53312	Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming. That inexorable,
 53313	eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt
 53314	continually all his lifeâwas now near to him and, by the strange
 53315	lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable....
 53316	
 53317	
 53318	Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly
 53319	tormenting fear of deathâthe endâbut now he no longer understood that
 53320	fear.
 53321	
 53322	He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before
 53323	him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and
 53324	knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to himself after
 53325	being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love had instantly
 53326	unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that
 53327	had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased to think about
 53328	it.
 53329	
 53330	During the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he
 53331	spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new
 53332	principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously
 53333	detached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody and
 53334	always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not
 53335	to live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that
 53336	principle of love, the more he renounced life and the more completely he
 53337	destroyed that dreadful barrier whichâin the absence of such loveâstands
 53338	between life and death. When during those first days he remembered that
 53339	he would have to die, he said to himself: âWell, what of it? So much the
 53340	better!â
 53341	
 53342	But after the night in MytÃ­shchi when, half delirious, he had seen her
 53343	for whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her hand to his
 53344	lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a particular woman again
 53345	crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life. And
 53346	joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. Recalling the
 53347	moment at the ambulance station when he had seen KurÃ¡gin, he could not
 53348	now regain the feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question
 53349	whether KurÃ¡gin was alive. And he dared not inquire.
 53350	
 53351	His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what NatÃ¡sha
 53352	referred to when she said: âThis suddenly happened,â had occurred two
 53353	days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle
 53354	between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It was
 53355	the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as
 53356	presented to him in the form of his love for NatÃ¡sha, and a last, though
 53357	ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.
 53358	
 53359	It was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, and his
 53360	thoughts were preternaturally clear. SÃ³nya was sitting by the table. He
 53361	began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.
 53362	
 53363	âAh, she has come!â thought he.
 53364	
 53365	And so it was: in SÃ³nyaâs place sat NatÃ¡sha who had just come in
 53366	noiselessly.
 53367	
 53368	Since she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced this
 53369	physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair
 53370	placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from him, and was
 53371	knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings since Prince
 53372	Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old
 53373	nurses who knit stockings, and that there is something soothing in
 53374	the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked lightly in her slender,
 53375	rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile
 53376	of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She
 53377	started, glanced round at him, and screening the candle with her hand
 53378	stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball,
 53379	and regained her former position.
 53380	
 53381	He looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a
 53382	deep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed
 53383	cautiously.
 53384	
 53385	At the TrÃ³itsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had told
 53386	her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had
 53387	brought them together again, but after that they never spoke of the
 53388	future.
 53389	
 53390	âCan it or can it not be?â he now thought as he looked at her and
 53391	listened to the light click of the steel needles. âCan fate have brought
 53392	me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the
 53393	truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent
 53394	my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in the world! But what
 53395	am I to do if I love her?â he thought, and he involuntarily groaned,
 53396	from a habit acquired during his sufferings.
 53397	
 53398	On hearing that sound NatÃ¡sha put down the stocking, leaned nearer to
 53399	him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to him
 53400	and bent over him.
 53401	
 53402	âYou are not asleep?â
 53403	
 53404	âNo, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in. No one
 53405	else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do... that light.
 53406	I want to weep for joy.â
 53407	
 53408	NatÃ¡sha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.
 53409	
 53410	âNatÃ¡sha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.â
 53411	
 53412	âAnd I!ââShe turned away for an instant. âWhy too much?â she asked.
 53413	
 53414	âWhy too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your soul, your
 53415	whole soulâshall I live? What do you think?â
 53416	
 53417	âI am sure of it, sure!â NatÃ¡sha almost shouted, taking hold of both his
 53418	hands with a passionate movement.
 53419	
 53420	He remained silent awhile.
 53421	
 53422	âHow good it would be!â and taking her hand he kissed it.
 53423	
 53424	NatÃ¡sha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would
 53425	not do and that he had to be quiet.
 53426	
 53427	âBut you have not slept,â she said, repressing her joy. âTry to sleep...
 53428	please!â
 53429	
 53430	He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and
 53431	sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at
 53432	him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her
 53433	stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.
 53434	
 53435	Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and
 53436	suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.
 53437	
 53438	As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now
 53439	always occupied his mindâabout life and death, and chiefly about death.
 53440	He felt himself nearer to it.
 53441	
 53442	âLove? What is love?â he thought.
 53443	
 53444	âLove hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I
 53445	understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only
 53446	because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to
 53447	die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and
 53448	eternal source.â These thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were
 53449	only thoughts. Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they
 53450	were too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former
 53451	agitation and obscurity. He fell asleep.
 53452	
 53453	He dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but that
 53454	he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and
 53455	insignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and
 53456	discussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere.
 53457	Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had
 53458	more important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by
 53459	empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to
 53460	disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded
 53461	all else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything
 53462	depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went, and
 53463	tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be
 53464	in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers. He
 53465	was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of death. It
 53466	stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward
 53467	the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing
 53468	against it and forcing its way in. Something not humanâdeathâwas
 53469	breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the
 53470	door, making a final effort to hold it backâto lock it was no longer
 53471	possibleâbut his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from
 53472	behind by that terror, opened and closed again.
 53473	
 53474	Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain
 53475	and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was
 53476	death, and Prince Andrew died.
 53477	
 53478	But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep,
 53479	and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke.
 53480	
 53481	âYes, it was death! I diedâand woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!â And
 53482	all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then
 53483	concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as
 53484	if powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that
 53485	strange lightness did not again leave him.
 53486	
 53487	When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, NatÃ¡sha went
 53488	up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at
 53489	her strangely, not understanding.
 53490	
 53491	That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Maryâs
 53492	arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever
 53493	assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest
 53494	NatÃ¡sha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more
 53495	convincing.
 53496	
 53497	From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with
 53498	his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration of life it did
 53499	not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the
 53500	duration of a dream.
 53501	
 53502	There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow
 53503	awakening.
 53504	
 53505	His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both
 53506	Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did
 53507	not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt
 53508	that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left
 53509	them) but on what reminded them most closely of himâhis body. Both felt
 53510	this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not
 53511	affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief.
 53512	Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever
 53513	talk to one another about him. They felt that they could not express in
 53514	words what they understood.
 53515	
 53516	They both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and deeper,
 53517	away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so and that it
 53518	was right.
 53519	
 53520	He confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of
 53521	him. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boyâs
 53522	and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and
 53523	NatÃ¡sha understood that) but simply because he thought it was all that
 53524	was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did
 53525	what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was
 53526	anything else he should do.
 53527	
 53528	When the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,
 53529	occurred, Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha were present.
 53530	
 53531	âIs it over?â said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes
 53532	lain motionless, growing cold before them. NatÃ¡sha went up, looked at
 53533	the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but did not
 53534	kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of himâhis
 53535	body.
 53536	
 53537	âWhere has he gone? Where is he now?...â
 53538	
 53539	When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,
 53540	everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.
 53541	
 53542	Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity.
 53543	The countess and SÃ³nya cried from pity for NatÃ¡sha and because he was
 53544	no more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too,
 53545	must take the same terrible step.
 53546	
 53547	NatÃ¡sha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their own
 53548	personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which
 53549	had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the
 53550	simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their
 53551	presence.

 53563	CHAPTER I
 53564	
 53565	Manâs mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but
 53566	the desire to find those causes is implanted in manâs soul. And without
 53567	considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one
 53568	of which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he snatches at the
 53569	first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says:
 53570	âThis is the cause!â In historical events (where the actions of men are
 53571	the subject of observation) the first and most primitive approximation
 53572	to present itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will of
 53573	those who stood in the most prominent positionâthe heroes of history.
 53574	But we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic eventâwhich
 53575	lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in itâto
 53576	be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the
 53577	actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled. It may seem
 53578	to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of
 53579	historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference
 53580	between a man who says that the people of the West moved on the East
 53581	because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because
 53582	it had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the
 53583	earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who
 53584	admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there
 53585	were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets. There
 53586	is, and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of
 53587	all causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws
 53588	are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.
 53589	The discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite
 53590	abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man,
 53591	just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was
 53592	possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the
 53593	earth.
 53594	
 53595	The historians consider that, next to the battle of BorodinÃ³ and the
 53596	occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the most
 53597	important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the Russian
 53598	army from the RyazÃ¡na to the KalÃºga road and to the TarÃºtino campâthe
 53599	so-called flank march across the KrÃ¡snaya PakhrÃ¡ River. They ascribe the
 53600	glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to
 53601	whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians, including the French,
 53602	acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of
 53603	that flank march. But it is hard to understand why military writers,
 53604	and following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound
 53605	conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. In
 53606	the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius
 53607	of this movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that
 53608	the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where
 53609	there are most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have
 53610	guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from Moscow
 53611	in 1812 was on the KalÃºga road. So it is impossible to understand by
 53612	what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver
 53613	was a profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why
 53614	they think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy
 53615	the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied,
 53616	or followed by other circumstances, might have proved ruinous to the
 53617	Russians and salutary for the French. If the position of the Russian
 53618	army really began to improve from the time of that march, it does not at
 53619	all follow that the march was the cause of it.
 53620	
 53621	That flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to
 53622	the Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its
 53623	destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If
 53624	Murat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained
 53625	inactive? If the Russian army at KrÃ¡snaya PakhrÃ¡ had given battle as
 53626	Bennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French
 53627	attacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the PakhrÃ¡? What
 53628	would have happened if on approaching TarÃºtino, Napoleon had attacked
 53629	the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he
 53630	attacked them at SmolÃ©nsk? What would have happened had the French moved
 53631	on Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank march that
 53632	brought salvation might have proved disastrous.
 53633	
 53634	The third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying
 53635	history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be
 53636	attributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in
 53637	reality, like the retreat from FilÃ­, it did not suggest itself to anyone
 53638	in its entirety, but resultedâmoment by moment, step by step, event by
 53639	eventâfrom an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only
 53640	seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the
 53641	past.
 53642	
 53643	At the council at FilÃ­ the prevailing thought in the minds of the
 53644	Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a
 53645	direct retreat by the NÃ­zhni road. In proof of this there is the fact
 53646	that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and above
 53647	all there is the well-known conversation after the council, between the
 53648	commander in chief and LanskÃ³y, who was in charge of the commissariat
 53649	department. LanskÃ³y informed the commander in chief that the army
 53650	supplies were for the most part stored along the OkÃ¡ in the TÃºla and
 53651	RyazÃ¡n provinces, and that if they retreated on NÃ­zhni the army would
 53652	be separated from its supplies by the broad river OkÃ¡, which cannot be
 53653	crossed early in winter. This was the first indication of the necessity
 53654	of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural courseâa
 53655	direct retreat on NÃ­zhni-NÃ³vgorod. The army turned more to the south,
 53656	along the RyazÃ¡n road and nearer to its supplies. Subsequently the
 53657	inactivity of the French (who even lost sight of the Russian army),
 53658	concern for the safety of the arsenal at TÃºla, and especially the
 53659	advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn
 53660	still further south to the TÃºla road. Having crossed over, by a forced
 53661	march, to the TÃºla road beyond the PakhrÃ¡, the Russian commanders
 53662	intended to remain at PodÃ³lsk and had no thought of the TarÃºtino
 53663	position; but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of French
 53664	troops who had for a time lost touch with the Russians, and projects
 53665	of giving battle, and above all the abundance of provisions in KalÃºga
 53666	province, obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross
 53667	from the TÃºla to the KalÃºga road and go to TarÃºtino, which was between
 53668	the roads along which those supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to
 53669	say when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say
 53670	precisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to TarÃºtino. Only
 53671	when the army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying
 53672	forces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this
 53673	movement and long ago foreseen its result.
 53674	
 53675	
 53676	
 53677	
 53678	
 53679	CHAPTER II
 53680	
 53681	The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance
 53682	of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually
 53683	retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct
 53684	course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the
 53685	district where supplies were abundant.
 53686	
 53687	If instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the
 53688	Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not
 53689	have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing
 53690	an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where
 53691	the country was richest.
 53692	
 53693	That movement from the NÃ­zhni to the RyazÃ¡n, TÃºla, and KalÃºga roads was
 53694	so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and
 53695	demands were sent from Petersburg for KutÃºzov to take his army that
 53696	way. At TarÃºtino KutÃºzov received what was almost a reprimand from
 53697	the Emperor for having moved his army along the RyazÃ¡n road, and the
 53698	Emperorâs letter indicated to him the very position he had already
 53699	occupied near KalÃºga.
 53700	
 53701	Having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the
 53702	whole campaign and by the battle of BorodinÃ³, the Russian armyâwhen
 53703	the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was
 53704	receivedâassumed the position natural to it.
 53705	
 53706	KutÃºzovâs merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is
 53707	called, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of
 53708	what had happened. He alone then understood the meaning of the French
 53709	armyâs inactivity, he alone continued to assert that the battle of
 53710	BorodinÃ³ had been a victory, he aloneâwho as commander in chief might
 53711	have been expected to be eager to attackâemployed his whole strength to
 53712	restrain the Russian army from useless engagements.
 53713	
 53714	The beast wounded at BorodinÃ³ was lying where the fleeing hunter had
 53715	left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and
 53716	merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was heard
 53717	to moan.
 53718	
 53719	The moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed its
 53720	calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to KutÃºzovâs camp with
 53721	overtures for peace.
 53722	
 53723	Napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was
 53724	right, wrote to KutÃºzov the first words that occurred to him, though
 53725	they were meaningless.
 53726	
 53727	
 53728	MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general
 53729	to discuss several interesting questions with you. I beg your Highness
 53730	to credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses the
 53731	sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your
 53732	person. This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le
 53733	prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection!
 53734	
 53735	NAPOLEON
 53736	
 53737	MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812
 53738	
 53739	
 53740	KutÃºzov replied: âI should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as
 53741	the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit
 53742	of my nation.â But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his
 53743	troops from attacking.
 53744	
 53745	During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and
 53746	the Russian troops were quietly encamped at TarÃºtino, a change had taken
 53747	place in the relative strength of the two armiesâboth in spirit and in
 53748	numberâas a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian
 53749	side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown
 53750	to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking
 53751	at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauristonâs
 53752	mission; the abundance of provisions at TarÃºtino; the reports coming in
 53753	from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of
 53754	recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian
 53755	soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been
 53756	assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been
 53757	resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of,
 53758	was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to
 53759	the French stationed at TarÃºtino; the news of easy successes gained by
 53760	peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this;
 53761	the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as
 53762	the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every
 53763	soldierâs mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and
 53764	that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial change
 53765	in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable. And at
 53766	once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand
 53767	has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an increased
 53768	activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.
 53769	
 53770	
 53771	
 53772	
 53773	
 53774	CHAPTER III
 53775	
 53776	The Russian army was commanded by KutÃºzov and his staff, and also by the
 53777	Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of Moscow
 53778	had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign
 53779	had been drawn up and sent to KutÃºzov for his guidance. Though this plan
 53780	had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands,
 53781	it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action.
 53782	KutÃºzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always
 53783	difficult to execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution
 53784	of difficulties that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who
 53785	were to watch KutÃºzovâs actions and report upon them.
 53786	
 53787	Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized.
 53788	The posts left vacant by BagratiÃ³n, who had been killed, and by
 53789	Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious
 53790	consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to
 53791	put A in Bâs place and B in Dâs, or on the contrary to put D in Aâs
 53792	place, and so onâas if anything more than Aâs or Bâs satisfaction
 53793	depended on this.
 53794	
 53795	As a result of the hostility between KutÃºzov and Bennigsen, his Chief of
 53796	Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the Emperor, and
 53797	these transfers, a more than usually complicated play of parties
 53798	was going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining B, D was
 53799	undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and permutations.
 53800	In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct
 53801	of the war, which all these men believed they were directing; but this
 53802	affair of the war went on independently of them, as it had to go:
 53803	that is, never in the way people devised, but flowing always from the
 53804	essential attitude of the masses. Only in the highest spheres did
 53805	all these schemes, crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true
 53806	reflection of what had to happen.
 53807	
 53808	
 53809	Prince Michael IlariÃ³novich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of October
 53810	in a letter that reached KutÃºzov after the battle at TarÃºtino) Since
 53811	September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last reports
 53812	were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has
 53813	no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient
 53814	capital, but according to your last report you have even retreated
 53815	farther. SÃ©rpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and TÃºla
 53816	with its famous arsenal, so indispensable to the army, is in danger.
 53817	From General Wintzingerodeâs reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten
 53818	thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several
 53819	thousand men is moving on DmÃ­trov. A third has advanced along the
 53820	VladÃ­mir road, and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed
 53821	between RÃºza and MozhÃ¡ysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as
 53822	the twenty-fifth. In view of all this information, when the enemy has
 53823	scattered his forces in large detachments, and with Napoleon and his
 53824	Guards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemyâs forces confronting you
 53825	are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the
 53826	contrary, he is probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with
 53827	an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem
 53828	that, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might advantageously
 53829	attack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least oblige him to
 53830	retreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now
 53831	occupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger from TÃºla and other
 53832	towns in the interior. You will be responsible if the enemy is able to
 53833	direct a force of any size against Petersburg to threaten this capital
 53834	in which it has not been possible to retain many troops; for with the
 53835	army entrusted to you, and acting with resolution and energy, you have
 53836	ample means to avert this fresh calamity. Remember that you have still
 53837	to answer to our offended country for the loss of Moscow. You have
 53838	experienced my readiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken
 53839	in me, but I and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal,
 53840	firmness, and success which your intellect, military talent, and the
 53841	courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting.
 53842	
 53843	
 53844	But by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of
 53845	the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched,
 53846	KutÃºzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he
 53847	commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.
 53848	
 53849	On the second of October a Cossack, ShapovÃ¡lov, who was out scouting,
 53850	killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded hare he made
 53851	his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Muratâs
 53852	army, encamped there without any precautions. The Cossack laughingly
 53853	told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the French.
 53854	A cornet, hearing the story, informed his commander.
 53855	
 53856	The Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished
 53857	to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of
 53858	the superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,
 53859	reported the incident to a general on the staff. The state of things on
 53860	the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. ErmÃ³lov had been to
 53861	see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use
 53862	his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the
 53863	offensive.
 53864	
 53865	âIf I did not know you I should think you did not want what you are
 53866	asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure to do
 53867	the opposite,â replied Bennigsen.
 53868	
 53869	The Cossackâs report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out, was
 53870	the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled spring was
 53871	released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play. Despite all
 53872	his supposed power, his intellect, his experience, and his knowledge
 53873	of men, KutÃºzovâhaving taken into consideration the Cossackâs report, a
 53874	note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to the Emperor, the wishes
 53875	he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals
 53876	expressed the same wishâcould no longer check the inevitable movement,
 53877	and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmfulâgave
 53878	his approval, that is, to the accomplished fact.
 53879	
 53880	
 53881	
 53882	
 53883	
 53884	CHAPTER IV
 53885	
 53886	Bennigsenâs note and the Cossackâs information that the left flank
 53887	of the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it was
 53888	necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of October.
 53889	
 53890	On the morning of the fourth of October KutÃºzov signed the dispositions.
 53891	Toll read them to ErmÃ³lov, asking him to attend to the further
 53892	arrangements.
 53893	
 53894	âAll rightâall right. I havenât time just now,â replied ErmÃ³lov, and
 53895	left the hut.
 53896	
 53897	The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the Austerlitz
 53898	dispositions, it was writtenâthough not in German this time:
 53899	
 53900	âThe First Column will march here and here,â âthe Second Column will
 53901	march there and there,â and so on; and on paper, all these columns
 53902	arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.
 53903	Everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,
 53904	and as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at the
 53905	appointed time.
 53906	
 53907	When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been
 53908	prepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ErmÃ³lov
 53909	to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, KutÃºzovâs orderly,
 53910	pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him, went to
 53911	ErmÃ³lovâs quarters.
 53912	
 53913	âGone away,â said ErmÃ³lovâs orderly.
 53914	
 53915	The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom ErmÃ³lov was
 53916	often to be found.
 53917	
 53918	âNo, and the generalâs out too.â
 53919	
 53920	The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.
 53921	
 53922	âNo, heâs gone out.â
 53923	
 53924	âIf only they donât make me responsible for this delay! What a nuisance
 53925	it is!â thought the officer, and he rode round the whole camp. One man
 53926	said he had seen ErmÃ³lov ride past with some other generals, others said
 53927	he must have returned home. The officer searched till six oâclock in the
 53928	evening without even stopping to eat. ErmÃ³lov was nowhere to be found
 53929	and no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at
 53930	a comradeâs, and rode again to the vanguard to find MilorÃ¡dovich.
 53931	MilorÃ¡dovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a
 53932	ball at General KÃ­kinâs and that ErmÃ³lov was probably there too.
 53933	
 53934	âBut where is it?â
 53935	
 53936	âWhy, there, over at Ãchkino,â said a Cossack officer, pointing to a
 53937	country house in the far distance.
 53938	
 53939	âWhat, outside our line?â
 53940	
 53941	âTheyâve put two regiments as outposts, and theyâre having such a spree
 53942	there, itâs awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!â
 53943	
 53944	The officer rode out beyond our lines to Ãchkino. While still at a
 53945	distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldierâs dance song
 53946	proceeding from the house.
 53947	
 53948	âIn the meadows... in the meadows!â he heard, accompanied by whistling
 53949	and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by shouts. These
 53950	sounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he was afraid that
 53951	he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order
 53952	entrusted to him. It was already past eight oâclock. He dismounted
 53953	and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained
 53954	intact between the Russian and French forces. In the refreshment room
 53955	and the hall, footmen were bustling about with wine and viands. Groups
 53956	of singers stood outside the windows. The officer was admitted and
 53957	immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together, and among
 53958	them ErmÃ³lovâs big imposing figure. They all had their coats unbuttoned
 53959	and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces,
 53960	laughing loudly. In the middle of the room a short handsome general with
 53961	a red face was dancing the trepÃ¡k with much spirit and agility.
 53962	
 53963	âHa, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas IvÃ¡nych! Ha, ha, ha!â
 53964	
 53965	The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment
 53966	he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait; but one of
 53967	the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come about, informed
 53968	ErmÃ³lov.
 53969	
 53970	ErmÃ³lov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the
 53971	officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.
 53972	
 53973	
 53974	âYou think he went off just by chance?â said a comrade, who was on the
 53975	staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to
 53976	ErmÃ³lov. âIt was a trick. It was done on purpose to get KonovnÃ­tsyn into
 53977	trouble. Youâll see what a mess thereâll be tomorrow.â
 53978

 53982	
 53983	CHAPTER V
 53984	
 53985	Next day the decrepit KutÃºzov, having given orders to be called early,
 53986	said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness of
 53987	having to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into his calÃ¨che
 53988	and drove from LetashÃ³vka (a village three and a half miles from
 53989	TarÃºtino) to the place where the attacking columns were to meet. He sat
 53990	in the calÃ¨che, dozing and waking up by turns, and listening for any
 53991	sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun.
 53992	But all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning. On
 53993	approaching TarÃºtino KutÃºzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to
 53994	water across the road along which he was driving. KutÃºzov looked at
 53995	them searchingly, stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they
 53996	belonged to. They belonged to a column that should have been far in
 53997	front and in ambush long before then. âIt may be a mistake,â thought
 53998	the old commander in chief. But a little further on he saw infantry
 53999	regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed,
 54000	eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The
 54001	officer reported that no order to advance had been received.
 54002	
 54003	âHow! Not rec...â KutÃºzov began, but checked himself immediately and
 54004	sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his calÃ¨che, he waited with
 54005	drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down. When
 54006	EÃ½khen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared,
 54007	KutÃºzov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame
 54008	for the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance
 54009	for him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell
 54010	into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the
 54011	ground, and he fell upon EÃ½khen, threatening him with his hands,
 54012	shouting and loading him with gross abuse. Another man, Captain BrÃ³zin,
 54013	who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame, suffered the
 54014	same fate.
 54015	
 54016	âWhat sort of another blackguard are you? Iâll have you shot!
 54017	Scoundrels!â yelled KutÃºzov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and
 54018	reeling.
 54019	
 54020	He was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene
 54021	Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had
 54022	in Russia, to be placed in this positionâmade the laughingstock of the
 54023	whole army! âI neednât have been in such a hurry to pray about today,
 54024	or have kept awake thinking everything over all night,â thought he to
 54025	himself. âWhen I was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to
 54026	mock me so... and now!â He was in a state of physical suffering as if
 54027	from corporal punishment, and could not avoid expressing it by cries of
 54028	anger and distress. But his strength soon began to fail him, and looking
 54029	about him, conscious of having said much that was amiss, he again got
 54030	into his calÃ¨che and drove back in silence.
 54031	
 54032	His wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he
 54033	listened to excuses and self-justifications (ErmÃ³lov did not come to see
 54034	him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, KonovnÃ­tsyn,
 54035	and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next
 54036	day. And once more KutÃºzov had to consent.
 54037	
 54038	
 54039	
 54040	
 54041	
 54042	CHAPTER VI
 54043	
 54044	Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening
 54045	and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with dark purple
 54046	clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops
 54047	advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery
 54048	could be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk out loud, to
 54049	smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried to prevent their
 54050	horses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm
 54051	and they marched gaily. Some columns, supposing they had reached their
 54052	destination, halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground,
 54053	but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they
 54054	evidently should not have been.
 54055	
 54056	Only Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov with his Cossacks (the least important
 54057	detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time. This
 54058	detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path leading from
 54059	the village of StromÃ­lova to DmÃ­trovsk.
 54060	
 54061	Toward dawn, Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, who had dozed off, was awakened by a
 54062	deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a Polish
 54063	sergeant of Poniatowskiâs corps, who explained in Polish that he had
 54064	come over because he had been slighted in the service: that he ought
 54065	long ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver than any of
 54066	them, and so he had left them and wished to pay them out. He said that
 54067	Murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were,
 54068	and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would
 54069	capture him alive. Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov consulted his fellow officers.
 54070	
 54071	The offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go and
 54072	everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and arguing,
 54073	Major-General GrÃ©kov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the
 54074	Polish sergeant.
 54075	
 54076	âNow, remember,â said Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov to the sergeant at parting,
 54077	âif you have been lying Iâll have you hanged like a dog; but if itâs
 54078	true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!â
 54079	
 54080	Without replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and rode
 54081	away with GrÃ©kov whose men had quickly assembled. They disappeared into
 54082	the forest, and Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, having seen GrÃ©kov off, returned,
 54083	shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he
 54084	had undertaken on his own responsibility, and began looking at the enemy
 54085	camp, now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying
 54086	campfires. Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open
 54087	declivity to his right. He looked in that direction, but though the
 54088	columns would have been visible quite far off, they were not to be seen.
 54089	It seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the French
 54090	camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this.
 54091	
 54092	âOh, it is really too late,â said Count OrlÃ³v, looking at the camp.
 54093	
 54094	As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before
 54095	our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the
 54096	sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian
 54097	attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which
 54098	he would lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a
 54099	commander in chief from among such a mass of troops!
 54100	
 54101	âI am sure that rascal was lying,â said the count.
 54102	
 54103	âThey can still be called back,â said one of his suite, who like Count
 54104	OrlÃ³v felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemyâs
 54105	camp.
 54106	
 54107	âEh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?â
 54108	
 54109	âWill you have them fetched back?â
 54110	
 54111	âFetch them back, fetch them back!â said Count OrlÃ³v with sudden
 54112	determination, looking at his watch. âIt will be too late. It is quite
 54113	light.â
 54114	
 54115	And the adjutant galloped through the forest after GrÃ©kov. When GrÃ©kov
 54116	returned, Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, excited both by the abandoned attempt and
 54117	by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear, as
 54118	well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance. All his men
 54119	felt the same excitement.
 54120	
 54121	âMount!â he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and
 54122	crossed themselves.... âForward, with Godâs aid!â
 54123	
 54124	âHurrah-ah-ah!â reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack companies,
 54125	trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out
 54126	of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.
 54127	
 54128	One desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw the
 54129	Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just waking
 54130	up, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and horses.
 54131	
 54132	Had the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind and
 54133	around them, they would have captured Murat and everything there.
 54134	That was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the
 54135	Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of them
 54136	listened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were
 54137	taken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most important to
 54138	the Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. All this had
 54139	to be dealt with, the prisoners and guns secured, the booty dividedânot
 54140	without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselvesâand it
 54141	was on this that the Cossacks all busied themselves.
 54142	
 54143	The French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: they
 54144	formed into detachments and began firing. OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, still waiting
 54145	for the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.
 54146	
 54147	Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that âthe First
 54148	Column will marchâ and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,
 54149	commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order
 54150	and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed
 54151	places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt;
 54152	murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and finally a
 54153	backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about, shouted, grew
 54154	angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and were late, gave
 54155	vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and went forward,
 54156	simply to get somewhere. âWe shall get somewhere or other!â And they did
 54157	indeed get somewhere, though not to their right places; a few eventually
 54158	even got to their right place, but too late to be of any use and only
 54159	in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this battle played the part of
 54160	Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped assiduously from place to place,
 54161	finding everything upside down everywhere. Thus he stumbled on BagovÃºtâs
 54162	corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight, though the corps
 54163	should long before have joined OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov. Excited and vexed by the
 54164	failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it, Toll
 54165	galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him
 54166	severely, saying that he ought to be shot. General BagovÃºt, a fighting
 54167	old soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay,
 54168	confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybodyâs surprise
 54169	and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things
 54170	to Toll.
 54171	
 54172	âI prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as
 54173	well as anybody,â he said, and advanced with a single division.
 54174	
 54175	Coming out onto a field under the enemyâs fire, this brave general went
 54176	straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering in his
 54177	agitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would
 54178	be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he
 54179	needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other
 54180	bullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for
 54181	some time quite uselessly.
 54182	
 54183	
 54184	
 54185	
 54186	
 54187	CHAPTER VII
 54188	
 54189	Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front,
 54190	but KutÃºzov accompanied that column. He well knew that nothing but
 54191	confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will, and as
 54192	far as was in his power held the troops back. He did not advance.
 54193	
 54194	He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering
 54195	suggestions that they should attack.
 54196	
 54197	âThe word attack is always on your tongue, but you donât see that we are
 54198	unable to execute complicated maneuvers,â said he to MilorÃ¡dovich who
 54199	asked permission to advance.
 54200	
 54201	âWe couldnât take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in
 54202	time, and nothing can be done now!â he replied to someone else.
 54203	
 54204	When KutÃºzov was informed that at the French rearâwhere according to the
 54205	reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobodyâthere were now
 54206	two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at ErmÃ³lov who was
 54207	behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day.
 54208	
 54209	âYou see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,
 54210	but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy,
 54211	forewarned, takes measures accordingly.â
 54212	
 54213	ErmÃ³lov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words.
 54214	He understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that KutÃºzov
 54215	would content himself with that hint.
 54216	
 54217	âHeâs having a little fun at my expense,â said ErmÃ³lov softly, nudging
 54218	with his knee RaÃ©vski who was at his side.
 54219	
 54220	Soon after this, ErmÃ³lov moved up to KutÃºzov and respectfully remarked:
 54221	
 54222	âIt is not too late yet, your Highnessâthe enemy has not gone awayâif
 54223	you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see
 54224	a little smoke.â
 54225	
 54226	KutÃºzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Muratâs troops
 54227	were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he
 54228	halted for three quarters of an hour.
 54229	
 54230	The whole battle consisted in what OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sovâs Cossacks had done:
 54231	the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.
 54232	
 54233	In consequence of this battle KutÃºzov received a diamond decoration,
 54234	and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also
 54235	received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades,
 54236	and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.
 54237	
 54238	âThatâs how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!â said the
 54239	Russian officers and generals after the TarÃºtino battle, letting it be
 54240	understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that
 54241	we ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today. But
 54242	people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about
 54243	or deliberately deceive themselves. No battleâTarÃºtino, BorodinÃ³, or
 54244	Austerlitzâtakes place as those who planned it anticipated. That is an
 54245	essential condition.
 54246	
 54247	A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during
 54248	a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence the course
 54249	taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in advance and
 54250	never coincides with the direction of any one force.
 54251	
 54252	If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given
 54253	body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those
 54254	forces, but will always be a meanâwhat in mechanics is represented by
 54255	the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.
 54256	
 54257	If in the descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we
 54258	find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously
 54259	formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions
 54260	are false.
 54261	
 54262	The battle of TarÃºtino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in
 54263	viewâto lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
 54264	dispositions; nor that which Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov may have had in viewâto
 54265	take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the whole
 54266	corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor the aim of
 54267	the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself; nor
 54268	that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and so on. But
 54269	if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the
 54270	Russians of that day desiredâto drive the French out of Russia and
 54271	destroy their armyâit is quite clear that the battle of TarÃºtino, just
 54272	because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage
 54273	of the campaign. It would be difficult and even impossible to imagine
 54274	any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. With
 54275	a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the greatest
 54276	confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were
 54277	attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the
 54278	weakness of the French, and the administration of that shock which
 54279	Napoleonâs army had only awaited to begin its flight.
 54280	
 54281	
 54282	
 54283	
 54284	
 54285	CHAPTER VIII
 54286	
 54287	Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there
 54288	can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the
 54289	hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient
 54290	capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and
 54291	incalculable wealth, is in Napoleonâs hands. The Russian army, only half
 54292	the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to attack for
 54293	a whole month. Napoleonâs position is most brilliant. He can either fall
 54294	on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate
 54295	an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on
 54296	Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to SmolÃ©nsk or
 54297	VÃ­lna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be
 54298	required to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time.
 54299	For that, only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow
 54300	the troops to loot, to prepare winter clothingâof which there was
 54301	sufficient in Moscow for the whole armyâand methodically to collect the
 54302	provisions, of which (according to the French historians) there were
 54303	enough in Moscow to supply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon,
 54304	that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of
 54305	the army, took none of these steps.
 54306	
 54307	He not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his
 54308	power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open
 54309	to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in Moscow,
 54310	advancing on Petersburg or on NÃ­zhni-NÃ³vgorod, or retiring by a more
 54311	northerly or more southerly route (say by the road KutÃºzov afterwards
 54312	took), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he
 54313	actually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting the troops
 54314	plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind
 54315	him, he quitted Moscow, approached KutÃºzov without joining battle,
 54316	turned to the right and reached MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, again without
 54317	attempting to break through and take the road KutÃºzov took, but retiring
 54318	instead to MozhÃ¡ysk along the devastated SmolÃ©nsk road. Nothing more
 54319	stupid than that could have been devised, or more disastrous for the
 54320	army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleonâs aim been to destroy his army,
 54321	the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series
 54322	of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose,
 54323	independently of anything the Russian army might do.
 54324	
 54325	Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his
 54326	army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as
 54327	unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he
 54328	wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.
 54329	
 54330	In both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the
 54331	personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that
 54332	guided the event.
 54333	
 54334	The historians quite falsely represent Napoleonâs faculties as having
 54335	weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify
 54336	his actions. He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he
 54337	could for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did
 54338	subsequently in 1813. His activity at that time was no less astounding
 54339	than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not
 54340	know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egyptâwhere forty
 54341	centuries looked down upon his grandeurâfor his great exploits there are
 54342	all told us by Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in
 54343	Austria or Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French
 54344	or German sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps
 54345	without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans
 54346	to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on
 54347	in Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius
 54348	in order to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the
 54349	matter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.
 54350	
 54351	His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as
 54352	elsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him
 54353	from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence
 54354	of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not
 54355	disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his
 54356	army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people
 54357	of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic
 54358	considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.

 54363	
 54364	CHAPTER IX
 54365	
 54366	With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry into
 54367	Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements
 54368	of the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and
 54369	charged Murat to find KutÃºzov. Then he gave careful directions about the
 54370	fortification of the KrÃ©mlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future
 54371	campaign over the whole map of Russia.
 54372	
 54373	With regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain YÃ¡kovlev,
 54374	who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of
 54375	Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity,
 54376	and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he
 54377	considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that RostopchÃ­n
 54378	had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched YÃ¡kovlev to
 54379	Petersburg.
 54380	
 54381	Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to TutÃ³lmin, he
 54382	dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.
 54383	
 54384	With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders
 54385	to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel RostopchÃ­n was
 54386	punished by an order to burn down his houses.
 54387	
 54388	With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a
 54389	constitution. A municipality was established and the following
 54390	announcement issued:
 54391	
 54392	
 54393	INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!
 54394	
 54395	Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King
 54396	desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he
 54397	punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to
 54398	put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A
 54399	paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your
 54400	municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your
 54401	needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red
 54402	ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear
 54403	a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red
 54404	ribbon round the left arm.
 54405	
 54406	The city police is established on its former footing, and better order
 54407	already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has
 54408	appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty
 54409	commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different
 54410	wards of the city. You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will
 54411	wear on the left arm. Several churches of different denominations are
 54412	open, and divine service is performed in them unhindered. Your fellow
 54413	citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been
 54414	given that they should find in them the help and protection due to
 54415	their misfortunes. These are the measures the government has adopted to
 54416	re-establish order and relieve your condition. But to achieve this
 54417	aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if
 54418	possible, forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain
 54419	the hope of a less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and
 54420	ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or
 54421	on what remains of your property, and finally that you should not doubt
 54422	that these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest
 54423	and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you
 54424	may be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of
 54425	a state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to
 54426	another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the
 54427	military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!
 54428	
 54429	
 54430	With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the
 54431	troops in turn should enter Moscow Ã  la maraude * to obtain provisions
 54432	for themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.
 54433	
 54434	    * As looters.
 54435	
 54436	With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back
 54437	and services to be again performed in the churches.
 54438	
 54439	With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was
 54440	placarded everywhere:
 54441	
 54442	PROCLAMATION
 54443	
 54444	You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom
 54445	misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of
 54446	the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!
 54447	Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in
 54448	it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places
 54449	on finding that they are respected. Any violence to them or to their
 54450	property is promptly punished. His Majesty the Emperor and King protects
 54451	them, and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey
 54452	his orders. He desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your
 54453	homes and families. Respond, therefore, to his benevolent intentions
 54454	and come to us without fear. Inhabitants, return with confidence to your
 54455	abodes! You will soon find means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen
 54456	and industrious artisans, return to your work, your houses, your shops,
 54457	where the protection of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay
 54458	for your work. And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where
 54459	you are hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full
 54460	assurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in the
 54461	city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of
 54462	the soil. The government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom
 54463	of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants, husbandmen, and those
 54464	living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their
 54465	supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets, of which one is on
 54466	the MokhovÃ¡ya Street and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such
 54467	supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may
 54468	agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be
 54469	free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him
 54470	under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday of each week are appointed
 54471	as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops
 54472	will be stationed along the highroads on Tuesdays and Saturdays at such
 54473	distances from the town as to protect the carts. (4) Similar measures
 54474	will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no
 54475	hindrance on their return journey. (5) Steps will immediately be taken
 54476	to re-establish ordinary trading.
 54477	
 54478	Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and artisans,
 54479	to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry out the
 54480	paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to
 54481	co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and
 54482	confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!
 54483	
 54484	
 54485	With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people,
 54486	reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The Emperor
 54487	rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his
 54488	preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were
 54489	established by his order.
 54490	
 54491	In regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,
 54492	Napoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma
 54493	MÃ¨re to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining
 54494	tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He
 54495	visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him
 54496	to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with TutÃ³lmin. Then, as
 54497	Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged
 54498	Russian money which he had prepared: âRaising the use of these means
 54499	by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief
 54500	be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food was too
 54501	precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part enemies,
 54502	Napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food
 54503	from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them.â
 54504	
 54505	With reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued
 54506	to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties
 54507	and to suppress robbery.
 54508	
 54509	
 54510	
 54511	
 54512	
 54513	CHAPTER X
 54514	
 54515	But strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plansâwhich were
 54516	not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstancesâdid not
 54517	affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock detached
 54518	from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without
 54519	engaging the cogwheels.
 54520	
 54521	With reference to the military sideâthe plan of campaignâthat work of
 54522	genius of which Thiers remarks that, âHis genius never devised anything
 54523	more profound, more skillful, or more admirable,â and enters into a
 54524	polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred
 54525	not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of Octoberâthat plan never was or
 54526	could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the
 54527	case. The fortifying of the KrÃ©mlin, for which la MosquÃ©e (as Napoleon
 54528	termed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have been razed to
 54529	the ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the KrÃ©mlin only helped
 54530	toward fulfilling Napoleonâs wish that it should be blown up when he
 54531	left Moscowâas a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to
 54532	be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so
 54533	concerned, produced an unheard-of result. The French generals lost touch
 54534	with the Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it
 54535	was only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skillâand apparently
 54536	the geniusâof Murat.
 54537	
 54538	With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleonâs arguments as to his
 54539	magnanimity and justice, both to TutÃ³lmin and to YÃ¡kovlev (whose chief
 54540	concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;
 54541	Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
 54542	embassage.
 54543	
 54544	With regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed
 54545	incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.
 54546	
 54547	With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a
 54548	municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain
 54549	people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of
 54550	preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from being
 54551	looted.
 54552	
 54553	With regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so easily been
 54554	settled by Napoleonâs visit to a mosque, no results were achieved.
 54555	Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out
 54556	Napoleonâs wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French
 54557	soldier while conducting service, and a French official reported of
 54558	another that: âThe priest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned
 54559	and locked up the church. That night the doors were again broken
 54560	open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders
 54561	perpetrated.â
 54562	
 54563	With reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen and
 54564	to peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious workmen, and
 54565	the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town
 54566	with the proclamation and killed them.
 54567	
 54568	As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,
 54569	these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the
 54570	KrÃ©mlin and in PosnyÃ¡kovâs house were closed again at once because the
 54571	actors and actresses were robbed.
 54572	
 54573	Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as
 54574	well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The
 54575	French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the
 54576	paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the
 54577	unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.
 54578	
 54579	But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given
 54580	by the authorities at that time was Napoleonâs attempt to stop the
 54581	looting and re-establish discipline.
 54582	
 54583	This is what the army authorities were reporting:
 54584	
 54585	âLooting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order
 54586	is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a
 54587	lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen
 54588	goods.â
 54589	
 54590	âThe neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of
 54591	the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate
 54592	inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have
 54593	the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly
 54594	witnessed.â
 54595	
 54596	âNothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillagingâOctober
 54597	9.â
 54598	
 54599	âRobbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our
 54600	district who ought to be arrested by a strong forceâOctober 11.â
 54601	
 54602	âThe Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to
 54603	stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning
 54604	to the KrÃ©mlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed
 54605	more violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The
 54606	Emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his
 54607	person, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to
 54608	such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army
 54609	supplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying
 54610	sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.â
 54611	
 54612	âThe Grand Marshal of the palace,â wrote the governor, âcomplains
 54613	bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to
 54614	commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows
 54615	of the Emperor.â
 54616	
 54617	That army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the
 54618	provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and
 54619	perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it did not
 54620	go away.
 54621	
 54622	It began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the
 54623	capture of transport trains on the SmolÃ©nsk road, and by the battle of
 54624	TarÃºtino. The news of that battle of TarÃºtino, unexpectedly received
 54625	by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians
 54626	(Thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole
 54627	army was demanding.
 54628	
 54629	Fleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had
 54630	stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal trÃ©sor, but on
 54631	seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers says)
 54632	horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not order all
 54633	the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a
 54634	certain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the calÃ¨ches and
 54635	carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very
 54636	good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the
 54637	sick, and the wounded.
 54638	
 54639	The plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which
 54640	feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the
 54641	skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it
 54642	entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps
 54643	and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal,
 54644	hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunterâs gun, runs forward and
 54645	back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his
 54646	whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of TarÃºtino
 54647	frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunterâs gun,
 54648	reached him, turned back, and finallyâlike any wild beastâran back along
 54649	the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was
 54650	familiar.
 54651	
 54652	During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been
 54653	the leader of all these movementsâas the figurehead of a ship may seem
 54654	to a savage to guide the vesselâacted like a child who, holding a couple
 54655	of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.
 54656	
 54657	
 54658	
 54659	
 54660	
 54661	CHAPTER XI
 54662	
 54663	Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the
 54664	shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little
 54665	blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about
 54666	him. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside KaratÃ¡ev at
 54667	night; it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned
 54668	again. Probably it had never had an owner, and it still belonged to
 54669	nobody and had no name. The French called it Azor; the soldier who
 54670	told stories called it FemgÃ¡lka; KaratÃ¡ev and others called it Gray, or
 54671	sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name, or even of a breed or
 54672	any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the
 54673	least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume, its bandy legs
 54674	served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run
 54675	very easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to use all
 54676	four. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping with
 54677	delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and
 54678	now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.
 54679	
 54680	Pierreâs attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only
 54681	remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldierâs trousers which by
 54682	KaratÃ¡evâs advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and
 54683	a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this
 54684	time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of
 54685	solidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache
 54686	covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested
 54687	with lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes
 54688	was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The former
 54689	slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an
 54690	energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet were bare.
 54691	
 54692	Pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen
 54693	were passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then
 54694	at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him,
 54695	and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various
 54696	positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he looked at his
 54697	bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction flitted across his face.
 54698	The sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned
 54699	during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him.
 54700	
 54701	For some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in
 54702	the morningsâwhat is called an âold wivesâ summer.â
 54703	
 54704	In the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly
 54705	pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in
 54706	the air.
 54707	
 54708	On everythingâfar and nearâlay the magic crystal glitter seen only at
 54709	that time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance,
 54710	with the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare trees,
 54711	the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire,
 54712	and the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out in the
 54713	transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness.
 54714	Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion
 54715	occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green
 54716	beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled houseâwhich in dull
 54717	weather was repulsively uglyâseemed quietly beautiful now, in the clear,
 54718	motionless brilliance.
 54719	
 54720	A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on
 54721	his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of
 54722	the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly wink.
 54723	
 54724	âWhat sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!â (Their name for Pierre.) âEh? Just like
 54725	spring!â
 54726	
 54727	And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe,
 54728	though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.
 54729	
 54730	âTo be on the march in such weather...â he began.
 54731	
 54732	Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told
 54733	him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an
 54734	order about the prisoners that day. SokolÃ³v, one of the soldiers in the
 54735	shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something
 54736	should be done about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not
 54737	worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and
 54738	arrangements would be made for the sick, and that in general everything
 54739	that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities.
 54740	
 54741	âBesides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain,
 54742	you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to the captain
 54743	when he makes his round, he will do anything for you.â
 54744	
 54745	(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre
 54746	and showed him all sorts of favors.)
 54747	
 54748	ââYou see, St. Thomas,â he said to me the other day. âMonsieur Kiril is
 54749	a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has
 54750	had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows whatâs what.... If he wants
 54751	anything and asks me, he wonât get a refusal. When one has studied, you
 54752	see, one likes education and well-bred people.â It is for your sake I
 54753	mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you
 54754	that affair would have ended ill.â
 54755	
 54756	And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair
 54757	he had alluded to had happened a few days beforeâa fight between the
 54758	prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in
 54759	pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre
 54760	talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said.
 54761	While Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving
 54762	Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of
 54763	the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way
 54764	of greeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had
 54765	given a shirt to sew was in that shed.
 54766	
 54767	A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them,
 54768	which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and
 54769	shirts for them.
 54770	
 54771	âReady, ready, dear fellow!â said KaratÃ¡ev, coming out with a neatly
 54772	folded shirt.
 54773	
 54774	KaratÃ¡ev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work,
 54775	was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His
 54776	hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast,
 54777	and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.
 54778	
 54779	âA promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is,
 54780	ready,â said PlatÃ³n, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.
 54781	
 54782	The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his
 54783	hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had
 54784	a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare
 54785	body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on
 54786	would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None
 54787	of the prisoners said a word.
 54788	
 54789	âSee, it fits well!â PlatÃ³n kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.
 54790	
 54791	The Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without raising
 54792	his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.
 54793	
 54794	âYou see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper
 54795	tools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,â said
 54796	PlatÃ³n with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his work.
 54797	
 54798	âItâs good, quite good, thank you,â said the Frenchman, in French, âbut
 54799	there must be some linen left over.â
 54800	
 54801	âIt will fit better still when it sets to your body,â said KaratÃ¡ev,
 54802	still admiring his handiwork. âYouâll be nice and comfortable....â
 54803	
 54804	âThanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?â said the
 54805	Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note and
 54806	gave it to KaratÃ¡ev. âBut give me the pieces that are over.â
 54807	
 54808	Pierre saw that PlatÃ³n did not want to understand what the Frenchman
 54809	was saying, and he looked on without interfering. KaratÃ¡ev thanked the
 54810	Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The Frenchman
 54811	insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked
 54812	Pierre to translate what he said.
 54813	
 54814	âWhat does he want the bits for?â said KaratÃ¡ev. âTheyâd make fine leg
 54815	bands for us. Well, never mind.â
 54816	
 54817	And KaratÃ¡ev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took
 54818	a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the
 54819	Frenchman without looking at him. âOh dear!â muttered KaratÃ¡ev and went
 54820	away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then
 54821	looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierreâs look had told him
 54822	something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:
 54823	
 54824	âPlatoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!â And handing back the odd
 54825	bits he turned and went out.
 54826	
 54827	âThere, look at that,â said KaratÃ¡ev, swaying his head. âPeople said
 54828	they were not Christians, but they too have souls. Itâs what the old
 54829	folk used to say: âA sweating handâs an open hand, a dry handâs close.â
 54830	Heâs naked, but yet heâs given it back.â
 54831	
 54832	KaratÃ¡ev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the
 54833	pieces.
 54834	
 54835	âBut theyâll make grand leg bands, dear friend,â he said, and went back
 54836	into the shed.
 54837	
 54838	
 54839	
 54840	
 54841	
 54842	CHAPTER XII
 54843	
 54844	Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though
 54845	the French had offered to move him from the menâs to the officersâ shed,
 54846	he had stayed in the shed where he was first put.
 54847	
 54848	In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme
 54849	limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical
 54850	strength and health, of which he had till then been unconscious, and
 54851	thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that
 54852	it was impossible to say when they began, he endured his position
 54853	not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he obtained the
 54854	tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach.
 54855	He had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind, that
 54856	inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle
 54857	of BorodinÃ³. He had sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the
 54858	dissipations of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice,
 54859	and in romantic love for NatÃ¡sha; he had sought it by reasoningâand all
 54860	these quests and experiments had failed him. And now without thinking
 54861	about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the
 54862	horror of death, through privation, and through what he recognized in
 54863	KaratÃ¡ev.
 54864	
 54865	Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it
 54866	were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating
 54867	thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did
 54868	not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or
 54869	Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things were no business
 54870	of his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and
 54871	therefore could not do so. âRussia and summer weather are not bound
 54872	together,â he thought, repeating words of KaratÃ¡evâs which he found
 54873	strangely consoling. His intention of killing Napoleon and his
 54874	calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now
 54875	seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his wife
 54876	and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely
 54877	trivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or
 54878	other that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter
 54879	to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that
 54880	their prisonerâs name was Count BezÃºkhov?
 54881	
 54882	He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite
 54883	agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrewâs thoughts somewhat
 54884	differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could
 54885	only be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony
 54886	as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is
 54887	implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre
 54888	believed it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering,
 54889	the satisfaction of oneâs needs and consequent freedom in the choice of
 54890	oneâs occupation, that is, of oneâs way of life, now seemed to Pierre to
 54891	be indubitably manâs highest happiness. Here and now for the first time
 54892	he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat,
 54893	drinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of
 54894	warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to
 54895	talk and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of oneâs needsâgood
 54896	food, cleanliness, and freedomânow that he was deprived of all this,
 54897	seemed to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice
 54898	of occupation, that is, of his way of lifeânow that that was so
 54899	restrictedâseemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a
 54900	superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying oneâs
 54901	needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupationâsuch freedom as
 54902	his wealth, his education, and his social position had given him in his
 54903	own lifeâis just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult
 54904	and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation.
 54905	
 54906	All Pierreâs daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free. Yet
 54907	subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke with
 54908	enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable, strong,
 54909	joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner
 54910	freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.
 54911	
 54912	When on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and
 54913	saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark
 54914	at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the
 54915	wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance,
 54916	when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the
 54917	crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when afterwards light
 54918	gleamed from the east and the sunâs rim appeared solemnly from behind a
 54919	cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the
 54920	river, all began to sparkle in the glad lightâPierre felt a new joy and
 54921	strength in life such as he had never before known. And this not only
 54922	stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in
 54923	strength as the hardships of his position increased.
 54924	
 54925	That feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still
 54926	further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners
 54927	formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge
 54928	of languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his
 54929	readiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance
 54930	of three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which he
 54931	showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut; his
 54932	gentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still and
 54933	thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible),
 54934	he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being. The very
 54935	qualities that had been a hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in
 54936	the world he had lived inâhis strength, his disdain for the comforts of
 54937	life, his absent-mindedness and simplicityâhere among these people gave
 54938	him almost the status of a hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion
 54939	placed responsibilities upon him.
 54940	
 54941	
 54942	
 54943	
 54944	
 54945	CHAPTER XIII
 54946	
 54947	The French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh
 54948	of October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts loaded, and troops
 54949	and baggage trains started.
 54950	
 54951	At seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing shakos
 54952	and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in front
 54953	of the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses sounded all
 54954	along the lines.
 54955	
 54956	In the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only awaited
 54957	the order to start. The sick soldier, SokolÃ³v, pale and thin with dark
 54958	shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed.
 54959	His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly
 54960	at his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned
 54961	regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that
 54962	caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being
 54963	left alone.
 54964	
 54965	Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes KaratÃ¡ev had
 54966	made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest
 54967	and brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and
 54968	squatted down beside him.
 54969	
 54970	âYou know, SokolÃ³v, they are not all going away! They have a hospital
 54971	here. You may be better off than we others,â said Pierre.
 54972	
 54973	âO Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!â moaned the man in a
 54974	louder voice.
 54975	
 54976	âIâll go and ask them again directly,â said Pierre, rising and going to
 54977	the door of the shed.
 54978	
 54979	Just as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him a
 54980	pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal and
 54981	soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal
 54982	straps, and these changed their familiar faces.
 54983	
 54984	The corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The prisoners
 54985	had to be counted before being let out.
 54986	
 54987	âCorporal, what will they do with the sick man?...â Pierre began.
 54988	
 54989	But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal
 54990	he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that
 54991	moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums
 54992	was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierreâs
 54993	words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed
 54994	became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned
 54995	the sick manâs groans.
 54996	
 54997	âThere it is!... It again!...â said Pierre to himself, and an
 54998	involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporalâs changed face,
 54999	in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the
 55000	drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled
 55001	people against their will to kill their fellow menâthat force the effect
 55002	of which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to try to
 55003	escape that force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those who
 55004	served as its tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait
 55005	and endure. He did not again go to the sick man, nor turn to look at
 55006	him, but stood frowning by the door of the hut.
 55007	
 55008	When that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one
 55009	another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed
 55010	his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had
 55011	assured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also in
 55012	marching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which Pierre
 55013	had recognized in the corporalâs words and in the roll of the drums.
 55014	
 55015	âPass on, pass on!â the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and
 55016	looking at the prisoners who thronged past him.
 55017	
 55018	Pierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.
 55019	
 55020	âWhat now?â the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing
 55021	Pierre.
 55022	
 55023	Pierre told him about the sick man.
 55024	
 55025	âHeâll manage to walk, devil take him!â said the captain. âPass on, pass
 55026	on!â he continued without looking at Pierre.
 55027	
 55028	âBut he is dying,â Pierre again began.
 55029	
 55030	âBe so good...â shouted the captain, frowning angrily.
 55031	
 55032	âDram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...â rattled the drums, and Pierre understood
 55033	that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it
 55034	was now useless to say any more.
 55035	
 55036	The officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march
 55037	in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and
 55038	about three hundred men.
 55039	
 55040	The officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to
 55041	Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his
 55042	shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major
 55043	with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a KazÃ¡n dressing
 55044	gown tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of
 55045	his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco
 55046	pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his
 55047	pipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and
 55048	growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that
 55049	they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were
 55050	all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at.
 55051	Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing
 55052	where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An
 55053	official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from
 55054	side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his
 55055	observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part
 55056	of the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent
 55057	was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was
 55058	mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.
 55059	
 55060	âWhat are you disputing about?â said the major angrily. âWhat does it
 55061	matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see itâs burned
 55062	down, and thereâs an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isnât the
 55063	road wide enough?â said he, turning to a man behind him who was not
 55064	pushing him at all.
 55065	
 55066	âOh, oh, oh! What have they done?â the prisoners on one side and another
 55067	were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. âAll beyond the
 55068	river, and ZÃºbova, and in the KrÃ©mlin.... Just look! Thereâs not half of
 55069	it left. Yes, I told youâthe whole quarter beyond the river, and so it
 55070	is.â
 55071	
 55072	âWell, you know itâs burned, so whatâs the use of talking?â said the
 55073	major.
 55074	
 55075	As they passed near a church in the KhamÃ³vniki (one of the few unburned
 55076	quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one
 55077	side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.
 55078	
 55079	âAh, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And
 55080	smeared with something!â
 55081	
 55082	Pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these
 55083	exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings
 55084	surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better
 55085	than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright
 55086	against the palings with its face smeared with soot.
 55087	
 55088	âGo on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...â the convoy
 55089	guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence,
 55090	drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at
 55091	the dead man.

 55097	CHAPTER XIV
 55098	
 55099	Through the cross streets of the KhamÃ³vniki quarter the prisoners
 55100	marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons
 55101	belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they
 55102	came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with
 55103	private vehicles.
 55104	
 55105	At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across.
 55106	From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage
 55107	trains before and behind them. To the right, where the KalÃºga road turns
 55108	near NeskÃºchny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into
 55109	the distance. These were troops of Beauharnaisâ corps which had started
 55110	before any of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the
 55111	Stone Bridge, were Neyâs troops and transport.
 55112	
 55113	Davoutâs troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the
 55114	Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the KalÃºga road.
 55115	But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnaisâ
 55116	train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the KalÃºga road when
 55117	the vanguard of Neyâs army was already emerging from the Great OrdÃ½nka
 55118	Street.
 55119	
 55120	When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps
 55121	forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men
 55122	crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred paces
 55123	that separated the bridge from the KalÃºga road, taking more than an
 55124	hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the
 55125	TransmoskvÃ¡ ward and the KalÃºga road converge, and the prisoners jammed
 55126	close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From all
 55127	sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the
 55128	tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood
 55129	pressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise
 55130	which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums.
 55131	
 55132	To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of
 55133	the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.
 55134	
 55135	âWhat crowds! Just look at the crowds!... Theyâve loaded goods even on
 55136	the cannon! Look there, those are furs!â they exclaimed. âJust see what
 55137	the blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one has behind
 55138	in the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by
 55139	heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has loaded
 55140	himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, theyâve even grabbed those
 55141	chaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks.... Heavens!
 55142	Theyâre fighting.â
 55143	
 55144	âThatâs right, hit him on the snoutâon his snout! Like this, we
 55145	shanât get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be
 55146	Napoleonâs own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! Itâs
 55147	like a portable house.... That fellowâs dropped his sack and doesnât see
 55148	it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either!
 55149	Yes, I dare say, thatâs the way theyâll let you pass.... Just look,
 55150	thereâs no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven, so they are! In
 55151	carriagesâsee how comfortably theyâve settled themselves!â
 55152	
 55153	Again, as at the church in KhamÃ³vniki, a wave of general curiosity
 55154	bore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to
 55155	his stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their
 55156	curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely
 55157	squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring
 55158	colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.
 55159	
 55160	From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious
 55161	force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse
 55162	smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned
 55163	ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression
 55164	on himâas if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to
 55165	receive impressions that might weaken it.
 55166	
 55167	The womenâs vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers,
 55168	wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts,
 55169	more soldiers, and now and then women.
 55170	
 55171	Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.
 55172	
 55173	All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible
 55174	power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from
 55175	the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly;
 55176	they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white
 55177	teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from
 55178	side to side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute
 55179	and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the
 55180	corporalâs face when the drums were beating.
 55181	
 55182	It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort
 55183	collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among
 55184	the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged
 55185	onto the KalÃºga road.
 55186	
 55187	They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the sun
 55188	began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men
 55189	began to prepare for their nightâs rest. They all appeared angry and
 55190	dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could
 55191	be heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran
 55192	into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several
 55193	soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat the
 55194	carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others fought among
 55195	themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head
 55196	by a sword.
 55197	
 55198	It seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid fields
 55199	in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and the same
 55200	feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on
 55201	that had seized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all seemed
 55202	to understand that they did not yet know where they were going, and that
 55203	much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey.
 55204	
 55205	During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they
 55206	had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the first time
 55207	received horseflesh for their meat ration.
 55208	
 55209	From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like
 55210	personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to
 55211	their former friendly relations.
 55212	
 55213	This spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of
 55214	prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian
 55215	soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw
 55216	a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from
 55217	the road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to
 55218	court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the
 55219	Russian. To the noncommissioned officerâs excuse that the prisoner was
 55220	ill and could not walk, the officer replied that the order was to shoot
 55221	those who lagged behind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had
 55222	crushed him during the executions, but which he had not felt during his
 55223	imprisonment, now again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but
 55224	he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush
 55225	him, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent
 55226	of it.
 55227	
 55228	He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his
 55229	comrades.
 55230	
 55231	Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in
 55232	Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of the
 55233	order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in reaction
 55234	against the worsening of their position they were all particularly
 55235	animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing
 55236	scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of
 55237	their present situation.
 55238	
 55239	The sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in the
 55240	sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the
 55241	rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray
 55242	haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night had not yet
 55243	come. Pierre got up and left his new companions, crossing between the
 55244	campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the
 55245	common soldier prisoners were stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On
 55246	the road he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.
 55247	
 55248	Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an
 55249	unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and
 55250	dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the
 55251	cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he
 55252	burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that
 55253	men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and
 55254	evidently solitary laughter could mean.
 55255	
 55256	âHa-ha-ha!â laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: âThe soldier
 55257	did not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me captive.
 55258	What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...â and he laughed
 55259	till tears started to his eyes.
 55260	
 55261	A man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at
 55262	all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther away from
 55263	the inquisitive man, and looked around him.
 55264	
 55265	The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the
 55266	crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the
 55267	red campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the light
 55268	sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, unseen
 55269	before, were now visible in the distance. And farther still, beyond
 55270	those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless distance
 55271	lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling
 55272	stars in its faraway depths. âAnd all that is me, all that is within me,
 55273	and it is all I!â thought Pierre. âAnd they caught all that and put it
 55274	into a shed boarded up with planks!â He smiled, and went and lay down to
 55275	sleep beside his companions.
 55276	
 55277	
 55278	
 55279	
 55280	
 55281	CHAPTER XV
 55282	
 55283	In the early days of October another envoy came to KutÃºzov with a letter
 55284	from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though
 55285	Napoleon was already not far from KutÃºzov on the old KalÃºga road.
 55286	KutÃºzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly
 55287	brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.
 55288	
 55289	Soon after that a report was received from DÃ³rokhovâs guerrilla
 55290	detachment operating to the left of TarÃºtino that troops of Broussierâs
 55291	division had been seen at FormÃ­nsk and that being separated from the
 55292	rest of the French army they might easily be destroyed. The soldiers and
 55293	officers again demanded action. Generals on the staff, excited by the
 55294	memory of the easy victory at TarÃºtino, urged KutÃºzov to carry out
 55295	DÃ³rokhovâs suggestion. KutÃºzov did not consider any offensive necessary.
 55296	The result was a compromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was
 55297	sent to FormÃ­nsk to attack Broussier.
 55298	
 55299	By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most
 55300	difficult and important one, was entrusted to DokhtÃºrovâthat same modest
 55301	little DokhtÃºrov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans
 55302	of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses on
 55303	batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as
 55304	undecided and undiscerningâbut whom we find commanding wherever the
 55305	position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from
 55306	Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the
 55307	Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all
 55308	were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear
 55309	guard. Ill with fever he went to SmolÃ©nsk with twenty thousand men
 55310	to defend the town against Napoleonâs whole army. In SmolÃ©nsk, at the
 55311	MalÃ¡khov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he
 55312	was awakened by the bombardment of the townâand SmolÃ©nsk held out all
 55313	day long. At the battle of BorodinÃ³, when BagratiÃ³n was killed and nine
 55314	tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the
 55315	French artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was
 55316	this same irresolute and undiscerning DokhtÃºrovâKutÃºzov hastening to
 55317	rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first.
 55318	And the quiet little DokhtÃºrov rode thither, and BorodinÃ³ became the
 55319	greatest glory of the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to
 55320	us in verse and prose, but of DokhtÃºrov scarcely a word has been said.
 55321	
 55322	It was DokhtÃºrov again whom they sent to FormÃ­nsk and from there to
 55323	MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, the place where the last battle with the French was
 55324	fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began;
 55325	and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the
 55326	campaign, but of DokhtÃºrov nothing or very little is said and that
 55327	dubiously. And this silence about DokhtÃºrov is the clearest testimony to
 55328	his merit.
 55329	
 55330	It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a
 55331	machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance
 55332	and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most
 55333	important part. The man who does not understand the construction of
 55334	the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which
 55335	revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine, and
 55336	not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.
 55337	
 55338	On the tenth of October when DokhtÃºrov had gone halfway to FormÃ­nsk and
 55339	stopped at the village of AristÃ³vo, preparing faithfully to execute the
 55340	orders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive
 55341	movement, reached Muratâs position apparently in order to give
 55342	battleâsuddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new
 55343	KalÃºga road and began to enter FormÃ­nsk, where only Broussier had
 55344	been till then. At that time DokhtÃºrov had under his command, besides
 55345	DÃ³rokhovâs detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and
 55346	SeslÃ¡vin.
 55347	
 55348	On the evening of October 11 SeslÃ¡vin came to the AristÃ³vo headquarters
 55349	with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the
 55350	troops that had entered FormÃ­nsk that day were the vanguard of the whole
 55351	army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four
 55352	days previously. That same evening a house serf who had come from
 55353	BÃ³rovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town. Some
 55354	Cossacks of DokhtÃºrovâs detachment reported having sighted the French
 55355	Guards marching along the road to BÃ³rovsk. From all these reports it was
 55356	evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there
 55357	was now the whole French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected
 55358	directionâalong the KalÃºga road. DokhtÃºrov was unwilling to undertake
 55359	any action, as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do. He had
 55360	been ordered to attack FormÃ­nsk. But only Broussier had been there at
 55361	that time and now the whole French army was there. ErmÃ³lov wished to act
 55362	on his own judgment, but DokhtÃºrov insisted that he must have KutÃºzovâs
 55363	instructions. So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff.
 55364	
 55365	For this purpose a capable officer, BolkhovÃ­tinov, was chosen, who
 55366	was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering
 55367	a written report. Toward midnight BolkhovÃ­tinov, having received the
 55368	dispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff
 55369	accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.
 55370	
 55371	
 55372	
 55373	
 55374	
 55375	CHAPTER XVI
 55376	
 55377	It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four days.
 55378	Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a
 55379	half over a sticky, muddy road, BolkhovÃ­tinov reached LitashÃ«vka after
 55380	one oâclock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence
 55381	hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered
 55382	a dark passage.
 55383	
 55384	âThe general on duty, quick! Itâs very important!â said he to someone
 55385	who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.
 55386	
 55387	âHe has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night
 55388	he has not slept,â said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. âYou should
 55389	wake the captain first.â
 55390	
 55391	âBut this is very important, from General DokhtÃºrov,â said
 55392	BolkhovÃ­tinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in
 55393	the dark.
 55394	
 55395	The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.
 55396	
 55397	âYour honor, your honor! A courier.â
 55398	
 55399	âWhat? Whatâs that? From whom?â came a sleepy voice.
 55400	
 55401	âFrom DokhtÃºrov and from AlexÃ©y PetrÃ³vich. Napoleon is at FormÃ­nsk,â
 55402	said BolkhovÃ­tinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but
 55403	guessing by the voice that it was not KonovnÃ­tsyn.
 55404	
 55405	The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.
 55406	
 55407	âI donât like waking him,â he said, fumbling for something. âHe is very
 55408	ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.â
 55409	
 55410	âHere is the dispatch,â said BolkhovÃ­tinov. âMy orders are to give it at
 55411	once to the general on duty.â
 55412	
 55413	âWait a moment, Iâll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you
 55414	always hide it?â said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,
 55415	to the orderly. (This was ShcherbÃ­nin, KonovnÃ­tsynâs adjutant.) âIâve
 55416	found it, Iâve found it!â he added.
 55417	
 55418	The orderly was striking a light and ShcherbÃ­nin was fumbling for
 55419	something on the candlestick.
 55420	
 55421	âOh, the nasty beasts!â said he with disgust.
 55422	
 55423	By the light of the sparks BolkhovÃ­tinov saw ShcherbÃ­ninâs youthful face
 55424	as he held the candle, and the face of another man who was still asleep.
 55425	This was KonovnÃ­tsyn.
 55426	
 55427	When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned
 55428	up, first blue and then red, ShcherbÃ­nin lit the tallow candle, from
 55429	the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
 55430	running away, and looked at the messenger. BolkhovÃ­tinov was bespattered
 55431	all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.
 55432	
 55433	âWho gave the report?â inquired ShcherbÃ­nin, taking the envelope.
 55434	
 55435	âThe news is reliable,â said BolkhovÃ­tinov. âPrisoners, Cossacks, and
 55436	the scouts all say the same thing.â
 55437	
 55438	âThereâs nothing to be done, weâll have to wake him,â said ShcherbÃ­nin,
 55439	rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a
 55440	greatcoat. âPeter PetrÃ³vich!â said he. (KonovnÃ­tsyn did not stir.) âTo
 55441	the General Staff!â he said with a smile, knowing that those words would
 55442	be sure to arouse him.
 55443	
 55444	And in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On
 55445	KonovnÃ­tsynâs handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever,
 55446	there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote
 55447	from present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face assumed
 55448	its habitual calm and firm appearance.
 55449	
 55450	âWell, what is it? From whom?â he asked immediately but without hurry,
 55451	blinking at the light.
 55452	
 55453	While listening to the officerâs report KonovnÃ­tsyn broke the seal and
 55454	read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in
 55455	their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his
 55456	boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair over his temples,
 55457	and donned his cap.
 55458	
 55459	âDid you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.â
 55460	
 55461	KonovnÃ­tsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great
 55462	importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or ask
 55463	himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest him. He
 55464	regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his
 55465	reason but by something else. There was within him a deep unexpressed
 55466	conviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this
 55467	and still less speak about it, but must only attend to oneâs own work.
 55468	And he did his work, giving his whole strength to the task.
 55469	
 55470	Peter PetrÃ³vich KonovnÃ­tsyn, like DokhtÃºrov, seems to have been included
 55471	merely for proprietyâs sake in the list of the so-called heroes of
 55472	1812âthe Barclays, RaÃ©vskis, ErmÃ³lovs, PlÃ¡tovs, and MilorÃ¡doviches. Like
 55473	DokhtÃºrov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity
 55474	and information, and like DokhtÃºrov he never made plans of battle but
 55475	was always found where the situation was most difficult. Since his
 55476	appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open,
 55477	giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up. In
 55478	battle he was always under fire, so that KutÃºzov reproved him for it and
 55479	feared to send him to the front, and like DokhtÃºrov he was one of those
 55480	unnoticed cogwheels that, without clatter or noise, constitute the most
 55481	essential part of the machine.
 55482	
 55483	Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night KonovnÃ­tsyn
 55484	frownedâpartly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the
 55485	unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of
 55486	influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news,
 55487	especially Bennigsen, who ever since TarÃºtino had been at daggers
 55488	drawn with KutÃºzov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue
 55489	orders, and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable to him
 55490	though he knew it could not be helped.
 55491	
 55492	And in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news, immediately
 55493	began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters, until
 55494	KonovnÃ­tsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded him that they must
 55495	go to see his Highness.

 55501	CHAPTER XVII
 55502	
 55503	KutÃºzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often fell
 55504	asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed
 55505	without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.
 55506	
 55507	So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on
 55508	his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the
 55509	darkness.
 55510	
 55511	Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more
 55512	influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, KutÃºzov
 55513	was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being
 55514	obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the
 55515	TarÃºtino battle and of the day before it, which KutÃºzov remembered with
 55516	pain, must, he thought, have some effect on others too.
 55517	
 55518	âThey must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.
 55519	Patience and time are my warriors, my champions,â thought KutÃºzov. He
 55520	knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall
 55521	of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree
 55522	is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman
 55523	he knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole
 55524	strength of Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally
 55525	wounded or not was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of
 55526	Lauriston and BarthÃ©lemi having been sent, and by the reports of the
 55527	guerrillas, KutÃºzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he
 55528	needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait.
 55529	
 55530	âThey want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall
 55531	see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!â thought he. âWhat for?
 55532	Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are
 55533	like children from whom one canât get any sensible account of what has
 55534	happened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But
 55535	thatâs not what is needed now.
 55536	
 55537	âAnd what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to
 55538	them that when they have thought of two or three contingenciesâ (he
 55539	remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) âthey have
 55540	foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.â
 55541	
 55542	The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at BorodinÃ³ was
 55543	mortal or not had hung over KutÃºzovâs head for a whole month. On the one
 55544	hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other KutÃºzov felt assured
 55545	with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the
 55546	Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal. But in any
 55547	case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew
 55548	more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those
 55549	sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals
 55550	for doing. He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like
 55551	the younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of
 55552	contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. The
 55553	longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. He
 55554	imagined all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or
 55555	in sectionsâagainst Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him.
 55556	He thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that
 55557	Napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in Moscow
 55558	awaiting him. KutÃºzov even imagined that Napoleonâs army might turn back
 55559	through MedÃ½n and YukhnÃ³v, but the one thing he could not foresee was
 55560	what happenedâthe insane, convulsive stampede of Napoleonâs army during
 55561	its first eleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made
 55562	possible what KutÃºzov had not yet even dared to think ofâthe complete
 55563	extermination of the French. DÃ³rokhovâs report about Broussierâs
 55564	division, the guerrillasâ reports of distress in Napoleonâs army, rumors
 55565	of preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that
 55566	the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were
 55567	only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not to
 55568	KutÃºzov. With his sixty yearsâ experience he knew what value to attach
 55569	to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news
 55570	so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew how readily
 55571	in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary. And the more
 55572	he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it. This question
 55573	absorbed all his mental powers. All else was to him only lifeâs
 55574	customary routine. To such customary routine belonged his conversations
 55575	with the staff, the letters he wrote from TarÃºtino to Madame de StaÃ«l,
 55576	the reading of novels, the distribution of awards, his correspondence
 55577	with Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction of the French, which he
 55578	alone foresaw, was his heartâs one desire.
 55579	
 55580	On the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm and
 55581	thinking of that.
 55582	
 55583	There was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,
 55584	KonovnÃ­tsyn, and BolkhovÃ­tinov.
 55585	
 55586	âEh, whoâs there? Come in, come in! What news?â the field marshal called
 55587	out to them.
 55588	
 55589	While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the substance
 55590	of the news.
 55591	
 55592	âWho brought it?â asked KutÃºzov with a look which, when the candle was
 55593	lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.
 55594	
 55595	âThere can be no doubt about it, your Highness.â
 55596	
 55597	âCall him in, call him here.â
 55598	
 55599	KutÃºzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch
 55600	resting against the other which was doubled under him. He screwed up his
 55601	seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to
 55602	read in his face what preoccupied his own mind.
 55603	
 55604	âTell me, tell me, friend,â said he to BolkhovÃ­tinov in his low, aged
 55605	voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest,
 55606	âcome nearerânearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon
 55607	has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?â
 55608	
 55609	BolkhovÃ­tinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had
 55610	been told to report.
 55611	
 55612	âSpeak quicker, quicker! Donât torture me!â KutÃºzov interrupted him.
 55613	
 55614	BolkhovÃ­tinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting
 55615	instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but KutÃºzov checked
 55616	him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered and
 55617	wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side of
 55618	the room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.
 55619	
 55620	âO Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...â said he in a
 55621	tremulous voice with folded hands. âRussia is saved. I thank Thee, O
 55622	Lord!â and he wept.
 55623	
 55624	
 55625	
 55626	
 55627	
 55628	CHAPTER XVIII
 55629	
 55630	From the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all
 55631	KutÃºzovâs activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by
 55632	authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks,
 55633	maneuvers, or encounters with the perishing enemy. DokhtÃºrov went to
 55634	MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, but KutÃºzov lingered with the main army and gave
 55635	orders for the evacuation of KalÃºgaâa retreat beyond which town seemed
 55636	to him quite possible.
 55637	
 55638	Everywhere KutÃºzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for his
 55639	retreat fled in the opposite direction.
 55640	
 55641	Napoleonâs historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at TarÃºtino
 55642	and MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, and make conjectures as to what would have
 55643	happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern
 55644	provinces.
 55645	
 55646	But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing
 55647	into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did not bar his
 55648	way), the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army, for
 55649	then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin. How
 55650	could that armyâwhich had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had
 55651	trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them, and on arriving at
 55652	SmolÃ©nsk had looted provisions instead of storing themâhow could that
 55653	army recuperate in KalÃºga province, which was inhabited by Russians such
 55654	as those who lived in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of
 55655	consuming what was set ablaze?
 55656	
 55657	That army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of BorodinÃ³
 55658	and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the
 55659	chemical elements of dissolution.
 55660	
 55661	The members of what had once been an armyâNapoleon himself and all his
 55662	soldiers--fled without knowing whither, each concerned only to make his
 55663	escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the hopelessness of
 55664	which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.
 55665	
 55666	So it came about that at the council at MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets, when the
 55667	generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all
 55668	mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier
 55669	Mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing
 55670	needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not
 55671	even Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all
 55672	recognized.
 55673	
 55674	But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there
 55675	still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee. An
 55676	external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in
 55677	due time. It was what the French called âle hourra de lâEmpereur.â
 55678	
 55679	The day after the council at MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets Napoleon rode out early in
 55680	the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and
 55681	an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the
 55682	previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks on the prowl for
 55683	booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the
 55684	Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very
 55685	thing that was destroying the French army, the booty on which the
 55686	Cossacks fell. Here as at TarÃºtino they went after plunder, leaving the
 55687	men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon
 55688	managed to escape.
 55689	
 55690	When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself
 55691	in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but
 55692	to fly as fast as possible along the nearest, familiar road. Napoleon
 55693	with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his
 55694	former agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright
 55695	the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued
 55696	ordersâas the historians tell usâto retreat by the SmolÃ©nsk road.
 55697	
 55698	That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, does
 55699	not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which
 55700	influenced the whole army and directed it along the MozhÃ¡ysk (that is,
 55701	the SmolÃ©nsk) road acted simultaneously on him also.
 55702	
 55703	
 55704	
 55705	
 55706	
 55707	CHAPTER XIX
 55708	
 55709	A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to go
 55710	a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the
 55711	end of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a promised
 55712	land to have the strength to move.
 55713	
 55714	The promised land for the French during their advance had been Moscow,
 55715	during their retreat it was their native land. But that native land
 55716	was too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely
 55717	necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself: âToday I
 55718	shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and
 55719	spend the night,â and during the first dayâs journey that resting place
 55720	eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires. And
 55721	the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.
 55722	
 55723	For the French retreating along the old SmolÃ©nsk road, the final
 55724	goalâtheir native landâwas too remote, and their immediate goal
 55725	was SmolÃ©nsk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously
 55726	intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that
 55727	much food and fresh troops awaited them in SmolÃ©nsk, nor that they were
 55728	told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself,
 55729	knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this alone could
 55730	give them strength to move on and endure their present privations. So
 55731	both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves, and
 55732	pushed on to SmolÃ©nsk as to a promised land.
 55733	
 55734	Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy
 55735	and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. Besides the
 55736	common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and
 55737	supplied them with a certain energy, there was another cause binding
 55738	them togetherâtheir great numbers. As with the physical law of gravity,
 55739	their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself. In their
 55740	hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation.
 55741	
 55742	Each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner
 55743	to escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one hand the force
 55744	of this common attraction to SmolÃ©nsk, their goal, drew each of them in
 55745	the same direction; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender
 55746	to a company, and though the French availed themselves of every
 55747	convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the
 55748	slightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. Their
 55749	very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that
 55750	possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the
 55751	Russians to stop this movement, to which the French were directing all
 55752	their energies. Beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the
 55753	body could hasten the process of decomposition.
 55754	
 55755	A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a certain
 55756	limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow. On
 55757	the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow
 55758	becomes.
 55759	
 55760	Of the Russian commanders KutÃºzov alone understood this. When the flight
 55761	of the French army along the SmolÃ©nsk road became well defined, what
 55762	KonovnÃ­tsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began
 55763	to occur. The superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves,
 55764	to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to overthrow the French, and all
 55765	clamored for action.
 55766	
 55767	KutÃºzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited in the
 55768	case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.
 55769	
 55770	He could not tell them what we say now: âWhy fight, why block the road,
 55771	losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches? What
 55772	is the use of that, when a third of their army has melted away on the
 55773	road from Moscow to VyÃ¡zma without any battle?â But drawing from his
 55774	aged wisdom what they could understand, he told them of the golden
 55775	bridge, and they laughed at and slandered him, flinging themselves on,
 55776	rending and exulting over the dying beast.
 55777	
 55778	ErmÃ³lov, MilorÃ¡dovich, PlÃ¡tov, and others in proximity to the French
 55779	near VyÃ¡zma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two
 55780	French corps, and by way of reporting their intention to KutÃºzov they
 55781	sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.
 55782	
 55783	And try as KutÃºzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,
 55784	trying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to the
 55785	attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost thousands
 55786	of men.
 55787	
 55788	But they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army,
 55789	closing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily melting
 55790	away, to pursue its fatal path to SmolÃ©nsk.

 55802	CHAPTER I
 55803	
 55804	The Battle of BorodinÃ³, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it
 55805	and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the
 55806	most instructive phenomena in history.
 55807	
 55808	All historians agree that the external activity of states and nations
 55809	in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a
 55810	direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength
 55811	of states and nations increases or decreases.
 55812	
 55813	Strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor,
 55814	having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemyâs
 55815	army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and
 55816	subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all
 55817	the facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the
 55818	statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another
 55819	is the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or
 55820	decrease in the strength of the nationâeven though it is unintelligible
 55821	why the defeat of an armyâa hundredth part of a nationâshould oblige
 55822	that whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the
 55823	rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the
 55824	defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its
 55825	rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army
 55826	suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.
 55827	
 55828	So according to history it has been found from the most ancient times,
 55829	and so it is to our own day. All Napoleonâs wars serve to confirm this
 55830	rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses
 55831	its rights, and the rights and the strength of France increase. The
 55832	victories of the French at Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt destroy the independent
 55833	existence of Prussia.
 55834	
 55835	But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is
 55836	taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that
 55837	ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and
 55838	then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of
 55839	history: to say that the field of battle at BorodinÃ³ remained in the
 55840	hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles
 55841	that destroyed Napoleonâs army, is impossible.
 55842	
 55843	After the French victory at BorodinÃ³ there was no general engagement nor
 55844	any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What
 55845	does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China,
 55846	we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the
 55847	historiansâ usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards);
 55848	if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number
 55849	of troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event
 55850	occurred before our fathersâ eyes, and for them it was a question of the
 55851	life or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of
 55852	all known wars.
 55853	
 55854	The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of BorodinÃ³ to the
 55855	expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not
 55856	produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest;
 55857	it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in
 55858	the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.
 55859	
 55860	The French historians, describing the condition of the French army
 55861	before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,
 55862	except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transportâthere was no forage
 55863	for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy,
 55864	for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the
 55865	French have it.
 55866	
 55867	The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants
 55868	Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their
 55869	carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest
 55870	any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such
 55871	peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered
 55872	them, but burned it instead.
 55873	
 55874	Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers
 55875	according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has
 55876	gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself
 55877	wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his
 55878	life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to
 55879	hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that the combatant who
 55880	so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was
 55881	at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to
 55882	conceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory
 55883	with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what
 55884	confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel.
 55885	
 55886	The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was
 55887	the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up
 55888	the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter
 55889	according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described
 55890	the event.
 55891	
 55892	After the burning of SmolÃ©nsk a war began which did not follow any
 55893	previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the
 55894	retreats after battles, the blow dealt at BorodinÃ³ and the renewed
 55895	retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of
 55896	transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.
 55897	
 55898	Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing
 55899	attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponentâs rapier saw a cudgel
 55900	raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to KutÃºzov and to
 55901	the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all
 55902	the rulesâas if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the
 55903	complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in
 55904	spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather
 55905	disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en
 55906	quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit
 55907	thrust en prime, and so onâthe cudgel of the peopleâs war was lifted
 55908	with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting
 55909	anyoneâs tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and
 55910	fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French
 55911	till the whole invasion had perished.
 55912	
 55913	And it is well for a people who do notâas the French did in 1813âsalute
 55914	according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their
 55915	rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror,
 55916	but at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have
 55917	adopted in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel
 55918	that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and
 55919	revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion.
 55920	
 55921	
 55922	
 55923	
 55924	
 55925	CHAPTER II
 55926	
 55927	One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called
 55928	laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed
 55929	together in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that take on a
 55930	national character. In such actions, instead of two crowds opposing
 55931	each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when attacked by
 55932	stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers. This was done
 55933	by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and
 55934	by the Russians in 1812.
 55935	
 55936	People have called this kind of war âguerrilla warfareâ and assume that
 55937	by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does
 55938	not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule
 55939	of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an
 55940	attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his
 55941	opponent at the moment of conflict.
 55942	
 55943	Guerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes
 55944	that rule.
 55945	
 55946	This contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes
 55947	the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military
 55948	science says that the more troops the greater the strength. Les gros
 55949	bataillons ont toujours raison. *
 55950	
 55951	    * Large battalions are always victorious.
 55952	
 55953	For military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics
 55954	by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal
 55955	to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.
 55956	
 55957	Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.
 55958	
 55959	In military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass
 55960	and some unknown x.
 55961	
 55962	Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact
 55963	that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that
 55964	small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence
 55965	of this unknown factor and tries to discover itânow in a geometric
 55966	formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the
 55967	genius of the commanders. But the assignment of these various meanings
 55968	to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic
 55969	facts.
 55970	
 55971	Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify
 55972	the âheroesâ) of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by
 55973	commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.
 55974	
 55975	That unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the
 55976	greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men
 55977	composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are not,
 55978	fighting under the command of a genius, in twoâor three-line formation,
 55979	with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men
 55980	who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous
 55981	conditions for fighting.
 55982	
 55983	The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives
 55984	the resulting force. To define and express the significance of this
 55985	unknown factorâthe spirit of an armyâis a problem for science.
 55986	
 55987	This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute
 55988	for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes
 55989	apparentâsuch as the commands of the general, the equipment employed,
 55990	and so onâmistaking these for the real significance of the factor,
 55991	and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being
 55992	the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only then,
 55993	expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative
 55994	significance of this factor, can we hope to define the unknown.
 55995	
 55996	Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, or
 55997	divisions, conquerâthat is, kill or take captiveâall the others, while
 55998	themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and on the other
 55999	fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and
 56000	therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This equation does not
 56001	give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two
 56002	unknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units (battles,
 56003	campaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of numbers
 56004	could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be
 56005	discovered.
 56006	
 56007	The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and
 56008	in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the
 56009	strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under
 56010	fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed
 56011	than is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of
 56012	account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in
 56013	particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or
 56014	fall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.
 56015	
 56016	The French, retreating in 1812âthough according to tactics they should
 56017	have separated into detachments to defend themselvesâcongregated into
 56018	a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass
 56019	held the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according
 56020	to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up
 56021	into small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate
 56022	individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing
 56023	any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and
 56024	dangers.
 56025	
 56026	
 56027	
 56028	
 56029	
 56030	CHAPTER III
 56031	
 56032	The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into
 56033	SmolÃ©nsk.
 56034	
 56035	Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the
 56036	government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had
 56037	been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off
 56038	as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. DenÃ­s DavÃ½dov,
 56039	with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of
 56040	this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science
 56041	destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first
 56042	step toward regularizing this method of warfare.
 56043	
 56044	On August 24 DavÃ½dovâs first partisan detachment was formed and then
 56045	others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more
 56046	numerous these detachments became.
 56047	
 56048	The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the
 56049	fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered treeâthe
 56050	French armyâand sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when
 56051	the French were fleeing toward SmolÃ©nsk, there were hundreds of such
 56052	companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted
 56053	all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the
 56054	comforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were
 56055	also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and
 56056	landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which
 56057	captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there
 56058	was VasÃ­lisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of the
 56059	French.
 56060	
 56061	The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of
 56062	October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,
 56063	amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded
 56064	and captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,
 56065	hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the end
 56066	of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become
 56067	clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what could
 56068	not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and moving
 56069	according to rules at a distance from the French, still regarded many
 56070	things as impossible. The small bands that had started their activities
 56071	long before and had already observed the French closely considered
 56072	things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare
 56073	to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the French
 56074	now considered everything possible.
 56075	
 56076	On October 22, DenÃ­sov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his
 56077	group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning he
 56078	and his party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching
 56079	from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of
 56080	cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the
 56081	army, whichâas was learned from spies and prisonersâwas moving under a
 56082	strong escort to SmolÃ©nsk. Besides DenÃ­sov and DÃ³lokhov (who also led
 56083	a small party and moved in DenÃ­sovâs vicinity), the commanders of some
 56084	large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and, as DenÃ­sov
 56085	expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders
 56086	of large partiesâone a Pole and the other a Germanâsent invitations
 56087	to DenÃ­sov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with their
 56088	divisions to attack the convoy.
 56089	
 56090	âNo, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,â said DenÃ­sov on reading
 56091	these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his heartfelt
 56092	desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to forgo
 56093	that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish
 56094	general. To the Polish general he replied to the same effect, informing
 56095	him that he was already under the command of the German.
 56096	
 56097	Having arranged matters thus, DenÃ­sov and DÃ³lokhov intended, without
 56098	reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that
 56099	convoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from
 56100	the village of MikÃºlino to that of ShÃ¡mshevo. To the left of the road
 56101	between MikÃºlino and ShÃ¡mshevo there were large forests, extending in
 56102	some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back
 56103	from it. Through these forests DenÃ­sov and his party rode all day,
 56104	sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very
 56105	edge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That morning,
 56106	Cossacks of DenÃ­sovâs party had seized and carried off into the forest
 56107	two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not
 56108	far from MikÃºlino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then,
 56109	and until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French
 56110	without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach ShÃ¡mshevo
 56111	quietly without alarming them and then, after joining DÃ³lokhov who was
 56112	to come that evening to a consultation at a watchmanâs hut in the forest
 56113	less than a mile from ShÃ¡mshevo, to surprise the French at dawn, falling
 56114	like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and rout and capture
 56115	them all at one blow.
 56116	
 56117	In their rear, more than a mile from MikÃºlino where the forest came
 56118	right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh
 56119	columns of French should show themselves.
 56120	
 56121	Beyond ShÃ¡mshevo, DÃ³lokhov was to observe the road in the same way, to
 56122	find out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned
 56123	that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. DenÃ­sov had two hundred, and
 56124	DÃ³lokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not
 56125	deter DenÃ­sov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were
 56126	and to learn that he had to capture a âtongueââthat is, a man from
 56127	the enemy column. That morningâs attack on the wagons had been made so
 56128	hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a
 56129	little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he
 56130	could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column.
 56131	
 56132	DenÃ­sov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of
 56133	putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent TÃ­khon ShcherbÃ¡ty, a
 56134	peasant of his party, to ShÃ¡mshevo to try and seize at least one of the
 56135	French quartermasters who had been sent on in advance.
 56136	
 56137	
 56138	
 56139	
 56140	
 56141	CHAPTER IV
 56142	
 56143	It was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both
 56144	the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then
 56145	suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.
 56146	
 56147	DenÃ­sov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down
 56148	was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse,
 56149	which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving
 56150	rain and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick
 56151	black beard looked angry.
 56152	
 56153	Beside DenÃ­sov rode an esaul, * DenÃ­sovâs fellow worker, also in felt
 56154	cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.
 56155	
 56156	    * A captain of Cossacks.
 56157	
 56158	Esaul LovÃ¡yski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,
 56159	pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm
 56160	self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to
 56161	say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first
 56162	glance at the esaul and DenÃ­sov one saw that the latter was wet and
 56163	uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the
 56164	esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always
 56165	and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was one
 56166	with his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold strength.
 56167	
 56168	A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and
 56169	wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.
 56170	
 56171	A little behind, on a poor, small, lean KirghÃ­z mount with an enormous
 56172	tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue
 56173	French overcoat.
 56174	
 56175	Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and
 56176	blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the
 56177	hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him
 56178	with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.
 56179	
 56180	Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cut up forest road came hussars in
 56181	threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French
 56182	greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses,
 56183	being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay.
 56184	Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely
 56185	thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet,
 56186	slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed
 56187	the road. The men sat huddled up trying not to stir, so as to warm the
 56188	water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold
 56189	water that was leaking in under their seats, their knees, and at the
 56190	back of their necks. In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two
 56191	wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had
 56192	been hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and
 56193	splashed through the water that lay in the ruts.
 56194	
 56195	DenÃ­sovâs horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped
 56196	his riderâs knee against a tree.
 56197	
 56198	âOh, the devil!â exclaimed DenÃ­sov angrily, and showing his teeth he
 56199	struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his
 56200	comrades with mud.
 56201	
 56202	DenÃ­sov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger
 56203	(none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he
 56204	still had no news from DÃ³lokhov and the man sent to capture a âtongueâ
 56205	had not returned.
 56206	
 56207	âThereâll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today.
 56208	Itâs too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till
 56209	another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey
 56210	from under our noses,â thought DenÃ­sov, continually peering forward,
 56211	hoping to see a messenger from DÃ³lokhov.
 56212	
 56213	On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the
 56214	right, DenÃ­sov stopped.
 56215	
 56216	âThereâs someone coming,â said he.
 56217	
 56218	The esaul looked in the direction DenÃ­sov indicated.
 56219	
 56220	âThere are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not presupposable
 56221	that it is the lieutenant colonel himself,â said the esaul, who was fond
 56222	of using words the Cossacks did not know.
 56223	
 56224	The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer
 56225	visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary
 56226	gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and
 56227	drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,
 56228	standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young
 56229	lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to DenÃ­sov
 56230	and handed him a sodden envelope.
 56231	
 56232	âFrom the general,â said the officer. âPlease excuse its not being quite
 56233	dry.â
 56234	
 56235	DenÃ­sov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.
 56236	
 56237	âThere, they kept telling us: âItâs dangerous, itâs dangerous,ââ
 56238	said the officer, addressing the esaul while DenÃ­sov was reading the
 56239	dispatch. âBut KomarÃ³v and Iââhe pointed to the Cossackââwere prepared.
 56240	We have each of us two pistols.... But whatâs this?â he asked, noticing
 56241	the French drummer boy. âA prisoner? Youâve already been in action? May
 56242	I speak to him?â
 56243	
 56244	âWostÃ³v! PÃ©tya!â exclaimed DenÃ­sov, having run through the dispatch.
 56245	âWhy didnât you say who you were?â and turning with a smile he held out
 56246	his hand to the lad.
 56247	
 56248	The officer was PÃ©tya RostÃ³v.
 56249	
 56250	All the way PÃ©tya had been preparing himself to behave with DenÃ­sov as
 56251	befitted a grown-up man and an officerâwithout hinting at their previous
 56252	acquaintance. But as soon as DenÃ­sov smiled at him PÃ©tya brightened
 56253	up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had been
 56254	rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already been in a battle
 56255	near VyÃ¡zma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there.
 56256	
 56257	âWell, I am glad to see you,â DenÃ­sov interrupted him, and his face
 56258	again assumed its anxious expression.
 56259	
 56260	âMichael FeoklÃ­tych,â said he to the esaul, âthis is again fwom that
 56261	German, you know. Heââhe indicated PÃ©tyaââis serving under him.â
 56262	
 56263	And DenÃ­sov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a
 56264	repetition of the German generalâs demand that he should join forces
 56265	with him for an attack on the transport.
 56266	
 56267	âIf we donât take it tomowwow, heâll snatch it fwom under our noses,â he
 56268	added.
 56269	
 56270	While DenÃ­sov was talking to the esaul, PÃ©tyaâabashed by DenÃ­sovâs
 56271	cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his
 56272	trousersâfurtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so
 56273	that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air as
 56274	possible.
 56275	
 56276	âWill there be any orders, your honor?â he asked DenÃ­sov, holding his
 56277	hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for
 56278	which he had prepared himself, âor shall I remain with your honor?â
 56279	
 56280	âOrders?â DenÃ­sov repeated thoughtfully. âBut can you stay till
 56281	tomowwow?â
 56282	
 56283	âOh, please... May I stay with you?â cried PÃ©tya.
 56284	
 56285	âBut, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?â asked
 56286	DenÃ­sov.
 56287	
 56288	PÃ©tya blushed.
 56289	
 56290	âHe gave me no instructions. I think I could?â he returned, inquiringly.
 56291	
 56292	âWell, all wight,â said DenÃ­sov.
 56293	
 56294	And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place
 56295	arranged near the watchmanâs hut in the forest, and told the officer on
 56296	the KirghÃ­z horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and
 56297	find out where DÃ³lokhov was and whether he would come that evening.
 56298	DenÃ­sov himself intended going with the esaul and PÃ©tya to the edge of
 56299	the forest where it reached out to ShÃ¡mshevo, to have a look at the part
 56300	of the French bivouac they were to attack next day.
 56301	
 56302	âWell, old fellow,â said he to the peasant guide, âlead us to
 56303	ShÃ¡mshevo.â
 56304	
 56305	DenÃ­sov, PÃ©tya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the
 56306	hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the
 56307	edge of the forest.
 56308	
 56309	
 56310	
 56311	
 56312	
 56313	CHAPTER V
 56314	
 56315	The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from
 56316	the trees. DenÃ­sov, the esaul, and PÃ©tya rode silently, following the
 56317	peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes
 56318	and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves,
 56319	silently led them to the edge of the forest.
 56320	
 56321	He ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to where
 56322	the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that
 56323	had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to
 56324	them with his hand.
 56325	
 56326	DenÃ­sov and PÃ©tya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was
 56327	standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a
 56328	downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep
 56329	ravine, was a small village and a landownerâs house with a broken roof.
 56330	In the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well, by the pond,
 56331	over all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill from the
 56332	bridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred yards
 56333	away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist. Their
 56334	un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the
 56335	carts, and their calls to one another, could be clearly heard.
 56336	
 56337	âBwing the prisoner here,â said DenÃ­sov in a low voice, not taking his
 56338	eyes off the French.
 56339	
 56340	A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to DenÃ­sov.
 56341	Pointing to the French troops, DenÃ­sov asked him what these and those
 56342	of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and
 56343	lifting his eyebrows, looked at DenÃ­sov in affright, but in spite of
 56344	an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers, merely
 56345	assenting to everything DenÃ­sov asked him. DenÃ­sov turned away from him
 56346	frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.
 56347	
 56348	PÃ©tya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now
 56349	at DenÃ­sov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and
 56350	along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.
 56351	
 56352	âWhether DÃ³lokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?â said DenÃ­sov with
 56353	a merry sparkle in his eyes.
 56354	
 56355	âIt is a very suitable spot,â said the esaul.
 56356	
 56357	âWeâll send the infantwy down by the swamps,â DenÃ­sov continued.
 56358	âTheyâll cweep up to the garden; youâll wide up fwom there with the
 56359	Cossacksââhe pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the villageââand I
 56360	with my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...â
 56361	
 56362	âThe hollow is impassableâthereâs a swamp there,â said the esaul. âThe
 56363	horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....â
 56364	
 56365	While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded
 56366	from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then
 56367	another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices
 56368	shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment DenÃ­sov and the
 56369	esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought they were the cause
 56370	of the firing and shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate
 56371	to them. Down below, a man wearing something red was running through the
 56372	marsh. The French were evidently firing and shouting at him.
 56373	
 56374	âWhy, thatâs our TÃ­khon,â said the esaul.
 56375	
 56376	âSo it is! It is!â
 56377	
 56378	âThe wascal!â said DenÃ­sov.
 56379	
 56380	âHeâll get away!â said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.
 56381	
 56382	The man whom they called TÃ­khon, having run to the stream, plunged in
 56383	so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an
 56384	instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on.
 56385	The French who had been pursuing him stopped.
 56386	
 56387	âSmart, that!â said the esaul.
 56388	
 56389	âWhat a beast!â said DenÃ­sov with his former look of vexation. âWhat has
 56390	he been doing all this time?â
 56391	
 56392	âWho is he?â asked PÃ©tya.
 56393	
 56394	âHeâs our plastÃºn. I sent him to capture a âtongue.ââ
 56395	
 56396	âOh, yes,â said PÃ©tya, nodding at the first words DenÃ­sov uttered as if
 56397	he understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of
 56398	it.
 56399	
 56400	TÃ­khon ShcherbÃ¡ty was one of the most indispensable men in their band.
 56401	He was a peasant from PokrÃ³vsk, near the river Gzhat. When DenÃ­sov had
 56402	come to PokrÃ³vsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual
 56403	summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French,
 56404	the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village
 56405	elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them. But
 56406	when DenÃ­sov explained that his purpose was to kill the French, and
 56407	asked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied that some
 56408	âmore-orderersâ had really been at their village, but that TÃ­khon
 56409	ShcherbÃ¡ty was the only man who dealt with such matters. DenÃ­sov had
 56410	TÃ­khon called and, having praised him for his activity, said a few words
 56411	in the elderâs presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country and
 56412	the hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should cherish.
 56413	
 56414	âWe donât do the French any harm,â said TÃ­khon, evidently frightened by
 56415	DenÃ­sovâs words. âWe only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know!
 56416	We killed a score or so of âmore-orderers,â but we did no harm else....â
 56417	
 56418	Next day when DenÃ­sov had left PokrÃ³vsk, having quite forgotten about
 56419	this peasant, it was reported to him that TÃ­khon had attached himself
 56420	to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it. DenÃ­sov gave
 56421	orders to let him do so.
 56422	
 56423	TÃ­khon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water,
 56424	flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude
 56425	for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always
 56426	brought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring
 56427	in French captives also. DenÃ­sov then relieved him from drudgery and
 56428	began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him
 56429	enrolled among the Cossacks.
 56430	
 56431	TÃ­khon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging
 56432	behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried
 56433	rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses
 56434	its teeth, with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching
 56435	thick bones. TÃ­khon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at
 56436	armâs length, or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs
 56437	or carve spoons. In DenÃ­sovâs party he held a peculiar and exceptional
 56438	position. When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be
 56439	doneâto push a cart out of the mud with oneâs shoulders, pull a horse
 56440	out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk
 56441	more than thirty miles in a dayâeverybody pointed laughingly at TÃ­khon.
 56442	
 56443	âIt wonât hurt that devilâheâs as strong as a horse!â they said of him.
 56444	
 56445	Once a Frenchman TÃ­khon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him
 56446	and shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which TÃ­khon
 56447	treated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the
 56448	subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachmentâjokes in which
 56449	TÃ­khon readily joined.
 56450	
 56451	âHallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?â the Cossacks would banter
 56452	him. And TÃ­khon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to be
 56453	angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect
 56454	of this incident on TÃ­khon was that after being wounded he seldom
 56455	brought in prisoners.
 56456	
 56457	He was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more
 56458	opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen,
 56459	and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars
 56460	and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by DenÃ­sov
 56461	overnight to ShÃ¡mshevo to capture a âtongue.â But whether because he
 56462	had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept
 56463	through the night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the
 56464	French and, as DenÃ­sov had witnessed from above, had been detected by
 56465	them.
 56466	
 56467	
 56468	
 56469	
 56470	
 56471	CHAPTER VI
 56472	
 56473	After talking for some time with the esaul about next dayâs attack,
 56474	which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have
 56475	definitely decided on, DenÃ­sov turned his horse and rode back.
 56476	
 56477	âNow, my lad, weâll go and get dwy,â he said to PÃ©tya.
 56478	
 56479	As they approached the watchhouse DenÃ­sov stopped, peering into the
 56480	forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,
 56481	wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a KazÃ¡n hat, was approaching
 56482	with long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax
 56483	stuck in his girdle. When he espied DenÃ­sov he hastily threw something
 56484	into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and
 56485	approached his commander. It was TÃ­khon. His wrinkled and pockmarked
 56486	face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He
 56487	lifted his head high and gazed at DenÃ­sov as if repressing a laugh.
 56488	
 56489	âWell, where did you disappear to?â inquired DenÃ­sov.
 56490	
 56491	âWhere did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,â answered TÃ­khon
 56492	boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.
 56493	
 56494	âWhy did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why
 56495	havenât you taken one?â
 56496	
 56497	âOh, I took one all right,â said TÃ­khon.
 56498	
 56499	âWhere is he?â
 56500	
 56501	âYou see, I took him first thing at dawn,â TÃ­khon continued, spreading
 56502	out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. âI took him
 56503	into the forest. Then I see heâs no good and think Iâll go and fetch a
 56504	likelier one.â
 56505	
 56506	âYou see?... What a wogueâitâs just as I thought,â said DenÃ­sov to the
 56507	esaul. âWhy didnât you bwing that one?â
 56508	
 56509	âWhat was the good of bringing him?â TÃ­khon interrupted hastily and
 56510	angrilyââthat one wouldnât have done for you. As if I donât know what
 56511	sort you want!â
 56512	
 56513	âWhat a bwute you are!... Well?â
 56514	
 56515	âI went for another one,â TÃ­khon continued, âand I crept like this
 56516	through the wood and lay down.â (He suddenly lay down on his stomach
 56517	with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) âOne turned up and
 56518	I grabbed him, like this.â (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) ââCome
 56519	along to the colonel,â I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there
 56520	were four of them. They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went
 56521	for them with my ax, this way: âWhat are you up to?â says I. âChrist
 56522	be with you!ââ shouted TÃ­khon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and
 56523	throwing out his chest.
 56524	
 56525	âYes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the
 56526	puddles!â said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.
 56527	
 56528	PÃ©tya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained from
 56529	laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from TÃ­khonâs face to the esaulâs
 56530	and DenÃ­sovâs, unable to make out what it all meant.
 56531	
 56532	âDonât play the fool!â said DenÃ­sov, coughing angrily. âWhy didnât you
 56533	bwing the first one?â
 56534	
 56535	TÃ­khon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,
 56536	then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,
 56537	disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called
 56538	ShcherbÃ¡tyâthe gap-toothed). DenÃ­sov smiled, and PÃ©tya burst into a peal
 56539	of merry laughter in which TÃ­khon himself joined.
 56540	
 56541	âOh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,â said TÃ­khon. âThe clothes
 56542	on himâpoor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why,
 56543	he says: âIâm a generalâs son myself, I wonât go!â he says.â
 56544	
 56545	âYou are a bwute!â said DenÃ­sov. âI wanted to question...â
 56546	
 56547	âBut I questioned him,â said TÃ­khon. âHe said he didnât know much.
 56548	âThere are a lot of us,â he says, âbut all poor stuffâonly soldiers in
 56549	name,â he says. âShout loud at them,â he says, âand youâll take
 56550	them all,ââ TÃ­khon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into
 56551	DenÃ­sovâs eyes.
 56552	
 56553	âIâll give you a hundwed sharp lashesâthatâll teach you to play the
 56554	fool!â said DenÃ­sov severely.
 56555	
 56556	âBut why are you angry?â remonstrated TÃ­khon, âjust as if Iâd never seen
 56557	your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and Iâll fetch you any of
 56558	them you wantâthree if you like.â
 56559	
 56560	âWell, letâs go,â said DenÃ­sov, and rode all the way to the watchhouse
 56561	in silence and frowning angrily.
 56562	
 56563	TÃ­khon followed behind and PÃ©tya heard the Cossacks laughing with him
 56564	and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes.
 56565	
 56566	When the fit of laughter that had seized him at TÃ­khonâs words and smile
 56567	had passed and PÃ©tya realized for a moment that this TÃ­khon had killed a
 56568	man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt
 56569	a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a moment. He felt
 56570	it necessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question
 56571	the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrowâs undertaking, that
 56572	he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.
 56573	
 56574	The officer who had been sent to inquire met DenÃ­sov on the way with the
 56575	news that DÃ³lokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.
 56576	
 56577	DenÃ­sov at once cheered up and, calling PÃ©tya to him, said: âWell, tell
 56578	me about yourself.â

 56584	CHAPTER VII
 56585	
 56586	PÃ©tya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined
 56587	his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a
 56588	large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission,
 56589	and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in
 56590	the battle of VyÃ¡zma, PÃ©tya had been in a constant state of blissful
 56591	excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to
 56592	miss any chance to do something really heroic. He was highly delighted
 56593	with what he saw and experienced in the army, but at the same time
 56594	it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being
 56595	performed just where he did not happen to be. And he was always in a
 56596	hurry to get where he was not.
 56597	
 56598	When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send
 56599	somebody to DenÃ­sovâs detachment, PÃ©tya begged so piteously to be sent
 56600	that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled
 56601	PÃ©tyaâs mad action at the battle of VyÃ¡zma, where instead of riding by
 56602	the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the
 56603	advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired
 56604	his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any
 56605	action whatever of DenÃ­sovâs. That was why PÃ©tya had blushed and grown
 56606	confused when DenÃ­sov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had
 56607	ridden to the outskirts of the forest PÃ©tya had considered he must carry
 56608	out his instructions strictly and return at once. But when he saw the
 56609	French and saw TÃ­khon and learned that there would certainly be an
 56610	attack that night, he decided, with the rapidity with which young people
 56611	change their views, that the general, whom he had greatly respected till
 56612	then, was a rubbishy German, that DenÃ­sov was a hero, the esaul a hero,
 56613	and TÃ­khon a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave
 56614	them at a moment of difficulty.
 56615	
 56616	It was already growing dusk when DenÃ­sov, PÃ©tya, and the esaul rode up
 56617	to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, and
 56618	Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and
 56619	were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French
 56620	could not see the smoke. In the passage of the small watchhouse a
 56621	Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. In the room
 56622	three officers of DenÃ­sovâs band were converting a door into a tabletop.
 56623	PÃ©tya took off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and at once began
 56624	helping the officers to fix up the dinner table.
 56625	
 56626	In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the
 56627	table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.
 56628	
 56629	Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton
 56630	with his hands, down which the grease trickled, PÃ©tya was in an ecstatic
 56631	childish state of love for all men, and consequently of confidence that
 56632	others loved him in the same way.
 56633	
 56634	âSo then what do you think, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich?â said he to DenÃ­sov. âItâs
 56635	all right my staying a day with you?â And not waiting for a reply he
 56636	answered his own question: âYou see I was told to find outâwell, I am
 56637	finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the chief... I
 56638	donât want a reward.... But I want...â
 56639	
 56640	PÃ©tya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head and
 56641	flourishing his arms.
 56642	
 56643	âInto the vewy chief...â DenÃ­sov repeated with a smile.
 56644	
 56645	âOnly, please let me command something, so that I may really command...â
 56646	PÃ©tya went on. âWhat would it be to you?... Oh, you want a knife?â he
 56647	said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton.
 56648	
 56649	And he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.
 56650	
 56651	âPlease keep it. I have several like it,â said PÃ©tya, blushing.
 56652	âHeavens! I was quite forgetting!â he suddenly cried. âI have some
 56653	raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and
 56654	he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something
 56655	sweet. Would you like some?...â and PÃ©tya ran out into the passage to
 56656	his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds
 56657	of raisins. âHave some, gentlemen, have some!â
 56658	
 56659	âYou want a coffeepot, donât you?â he asked the esaul. âI bought a
 56660	capital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And heâs very
 56661	honest, thatâs the chief thing. Iâll be sure to send it to you. Or
 56662	perhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn outâthat happens
 56663	sometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they areââand he
 56664	showed a bagââa hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please take as
 56665	many as you want, or all if you like....â
 56666	
 56667	Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, PÃ©tya stopped and
 56668	blushed.
 56669	
 56670	He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was
 56671	foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered the French
 56672	drummer boy. âItâs capital for us here, but what of him? Where have they
 56673	put him? Have they fed him? Havenât they hurt his feelings?â he thought.
 56674	But having caught himself saying too much about the flints, he was now
 56675	afraid to speak out.
 56676	
 56677	âI might ask,â he thought, âbut theyâll say: âHeâs a boy himself and so
 56678	he pities the boy.â Iâll show them tomorrow whether Iâm a boy. Will it
 56679	seem odd if I ask?â PÃ©tya thought. âWell, never mind!â and immediately,
 56680	blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared
 56681	ironical, he said:
 56682	
 56683	âMay I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to
 56684	eat?... Perhaps...â
 56685	
 56686	âYes, heâs a poor little fellow,â said DenÃ­sov, who evidently saw
 56687	nothing shameful in this reminder. âCall him in. His name is Vincent
 56688	Bosse. Have him fetched.â
 56689	
 56690	âIâll call him,â said PÃ©tya.
 56691	
 56692	âYes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,â DenÃ­sov repeated.
 56693	
 56694	PÃ©tya was standing at the door when DenÃ­sov said this. He slipped in
 56695	between the officers, came close to DenÃ­sov, and said:
 56696	
 56697	âLet me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!â
 56698	
 56699	And having kissed DenÃ­sov he ran out of the hut.
 56700	
 56701	âBosse! Vincent!â PÃ©tya cried, stopping outside the door.
 56702	
 56703	âWho do you want, sir?â asked a voice in the darkness.
 56704	
 56705	PÃ©tya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that
 56706	day.
 56707	
 56708	âAh, VesÃ©nny?â said a Cossack.
 56709	
 56710	Vincent, the boyâs name, had already been changed by the Cossacks into
 56711	VesÃ©nny (vernal) and into VesÃ©nya by the peasants and soldiers. In both
 56712	these adaptations the reference to spring (vesnÃ¡) matched the impression
 56713	made by the young lad.
 56714	
 56715	âHe is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, VesÃ©nya!
 56716	VesÃ©nya!âVesÃ©nny!â laughing voices were heard calling to one another in
 56717	the darkness.
 56718	
 56719	âHeâs a smart lad,â said an hussar standing near PÃ©tya. âWe gave him
 56720	something to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!â
 56721	
 56722	The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the
 56723	darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.
 56724	
 56725	âAh, câest vous!â said PÃ©tya. âVoulez-vous manger? Nâayez pas peur, on
 56726	ne vous fera pas de mal,â * he added shyly and affectionately, touching
 56727	the boyâs hand. âEntrez, entrez.â *(2)
 56728	
 56729	     * âAh, itâs you! Do you want something to eat? Donât be
 56730	     afraid, they wonât hurt you.â
 56731	
 56732	     * (2) âCome in, come in.â
 56733	
 56734	
 56735	âMerci, monsieur,â * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish
 56736	voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.
 56737	
 56738	    * âThank you, sir.â
 56739	
 56740	
 56741	There were many things PÃ©tya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did
 56742	not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in
 56743	the darkness he took the boyâs hand and pressed it.
 56744	
 56745	âCome in, come in!â he repeated in a gentle whisper. âOh, what can I do
 56746	for him?â he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.
 56747	
 56748	When the boy had entered the hut, PÃ©tya sat down at a distance from
 56749	him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. But
 56750	he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem
 56751	ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.
 56752	
 56753	
 56754	
 56755	
 56756	
 56757	CHAPTER VIII
 56758	
 56759	The arrival of DÃ³lokhov diverted PÃ©tyaâs attention from the drummer boy,
 56760	to whom DenÃ­sov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had
 56761	dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and
 56762	not sent away with the other prisoners. PÃ©tya had heard in the army many
 56763	stories of DÃ³lokhovâs extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the
 56764	French, so from the moment he entered the hut PÃ©tya did not take his
 56765	eyes from him, but braced himself up more and more and held his head
 56766	high, that he might not be unworthy even of such company.
 56767	
 56768	DÃ³lokhovâs appearance amazed PÃ©tya by its simplicity.
 56769	
 56770	DenÃ­sov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas the
 56771	Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and everything he
 56772	did indicated his unusual position. But DÃ³lokhov, who in Moscow had worn
 56773	a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of
 56774	the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsmanâs padded coat with
 56775	an Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set
 56776	straight on his head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of
 56777	the room, and without greeting anyone went up to DenÃ­sov and began
 56778	questioning him about the matter in hand. DenÃ­sov told him of the
 56779	designs the large detachments had on the transport, of the message PÃ©tya
 56780	had brought, and his own replies to both generals. Then he told him all
 56781	he knew of the French detachment.
 56782	
 56783	âThatâs so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,â
 56784	said DÃ³lokhov. âIt will be necessary to go there. We canât start the
 56785	affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I like to work
 56786	accurately. Here nowâwouldnât one of these gentlemen like to ride over
 56787	to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare uniform.â
 56788	
 56789	âI, I... Iâll go with you!â cried PÃ©tya.
 56790	
 56791	âThereâs no need for you to go at all,â said DenÃ­sov, addressing
 56792	DÃ³lokhov, âand as for him, I wonât let him go on any account.â
 56793	
 56794	âI like that!â exclaimed PÃ©tya. âWhy shouldnât I go?â
 56795	
 56796	âBecause itâs useless.â
 56797	
 56798	âWell, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and thatâs
 56799	all. Youâll take me, wonât you?â he said, turning to DÃ³lokhov.
 56800	
 56801	âWhy not?â DÃ³lokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of the
 56802	French drummer boy. âHave you had that youngster with you long?â he
 56803	asked DenÃ­sov.
 56804	
 56805	âHe was taken today but he knows nothing. Iâm keeping him with me.â
 56806	
 56807	âYes, and where do you put the others?â inquired DÃ³lokhov.
 56808	
 56809	âWhere? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,â shouted DenÃ­sov,
 56810	suddenly flushing. âAnd I say boldly that I have not a single manâs life
 56811	on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or
 56812	thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of stainingâI speak
 56813	bluntlyâstaining the honor of a soldier?â
 56814	
 56815	âThat kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of
 56816	sixteen,â said DÃ³lokhov with cold irony, âbut itâs time for you to drop
 56817	it.â
 56818	
 56819	âWhy, Iâve not said anything! I only say that Iâll certainly go with
 56820	you,â said PÃ©tya shyly.
 56821	
 56822	âBut for you and me, old fellow, itâs time to drop these amenities,â
 56823	continued DÃ³lokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of
 56824	this subject which irritated DenÃ­sov. âNow, why have you kept this lad?â
 56825	he went on, swaying his head. âBecause you are sorry for him! Donât we
 56826	know those âreceiptsâ of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty
 56827	get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So isnât it all the
 56828	same not to send them?â
 56829	
 56830	The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.
 56831	
 56832	âThatâs not the point. Iâm not going to discuss the matter. I do not
 56833	wish to take it on my conscience. You say theyâll die. All wight. Only
 56834	not by my fault!â
 56835	
 56836	DÃ³lokhov began laughing.
 56837	
 56838	âWho has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if
 56839	they did catch me theyâd string me up to an aspen tree, and with all
 56840	your chivalry just the same.â He paused. âHowever, we must get to work.
 56841	Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms in it.
 56842	Well, are you coming with me?â he asked PÃ©tya.
 56843	
 56844	âI? Yes, yes, certainly!â cried PÃ©tya, blushing almost to tears and
 56845	glancing at DenÃ­sov.
 56846	
 56847	While DÃ³lokhov had been disputing with DenÃ­sov what should be done with
 56848	prisoners, PÃ©tya had once more felt awkward and restless; but again he
 56849	had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about. âIf grown-up,
 56850	distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and right,â thought he.
 56851	âBut above all DenÃ­sov must not dare to imagine that Iâll obey him and
 56852	that he can order me about. I will certainly go to the French camp with
 56853	DÃ³lokhov. If he can, so can I!â
 56854	
 56855	And to all DenÃ­sovâs persuasions, PÃ©tya replied that he too was
 56856	accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that he
 56857	never considered personal danger.
 56858	
 56859	âFor youâll admit that if we donât know for sure how many of them there
 56860	are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two
 56861	of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so donât
 56862	hinder me,â said he. âIt will only make things worse....â
 56863	
 56864	
 56865	
 56866	
 56867	
 56868	CHAPTER IX
 56869	
 56870	Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, PÃ©tya and DÃ³lokhov rode to
 56871	the clearing from which DenÃ­sov had reconnoitered the French camp,
 56872	and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the
 56873	hollow. On reaching the bottom, DÃ³lokhov told the Cossacks accompanying
 56874	him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the
 56875	bridge. PÃ©tya, his heart in his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.
 56876	
 56877	âIf weâre caught, I wonât be taken alive! I have a pistol,â whispered
 56878	he.
 56879	
 56880	âDonât talk Russian,â said DÃ³lokhov in a hurried whisper, and at that
 56881	very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: âQui vive?â *
 56882	and the click of a musket.
 56883	
 56884	    * âWho goes there?â
 56885	
 56886	
 56887	The blood rushed to PÃ©tyaâs face and he grasped his pistol.
 56888	
 56889	âLanciers du 6-me,â * replied DÃ³lokhov, neither hastening nor slackening
 56890	his horseâs pace.
 56891	
 56892	    * âLancers of the 6th Regiment.â
 56893	
 56894	
 56895	The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.
 56896	
 56897	âMot dâordre.â *
 56898	
 56899	    * âPassword.â
 56900	
 56901	
 56902	DÃ³lokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.
 56903	
 56904	âDites donc, le colonel GÃ©rard est ici?â * he asked.
 56905	
 56906	    * âTell me, is Colonel GÃ©rard here?â
 56907	
 56908	
 56909	âMot dâordre,â repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.
 56910	
 56911	âQuand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le
 56912	mot dâordre...â cried DÃ³lokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight
 56913	at the sentinel. âJe vous demande si le colonel est ici.â *
 56914	
 56915	     * âWhen an officer is making his round, sentinels donât ask
 56916	     him for the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is
 56917	     here.â
 56918	
 56919	
 56920	And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped
 56921	aside, DÃ³lokhov rode up the incline at a walk.
 56922	
 56923	Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, DÃ³lokhov stopped
 56924	him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man,
 56925	a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to
 56926	DÃ³lokhovâs horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in
 56927	a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up
 56928	the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the
 56929	landownerâs house.
 56930	
 56931	Having ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be
 56932	heard around the campfires, DÃ³lokhov turned into the courtyard of the
 56933	landownerâs house. Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a
 56934	big blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily.
 56935	Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and
 56936	a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was
 56937	kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.
 56938	
 56939	âOh, heâs a hard nut to crack,â said one of the officers who was sitting
 56940	in the shadow at the other side of the fire.
 56941	
 56942	âHeâll make them get a move on, those fellows!â said another, laughing.
 56943	
 56944	Both fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of
 56945	DÃ³lokhovâs and PÃ©tyaâs steps as they advanced to the fire leading their
 56946	horses.
 56947	
 56948	âBonjour, messieurs!â * said DÃ³lokhov loudly and clearly.
 56949	
 56950	    * âGood day, gentlemen.â
 56951	
 56952	
 56953	There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire,
 56954	and one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up to
 56955	DÃ³lokhov.
 56956	
 56957	âIs that you, ClÃ©ment?â he asked. âWhere the devil...?â But, noticing
 56958	his mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted DÃ³lokhov as a
 56959	stranger, asking what he could do for him.
 56960	
 56961	DÃ³lokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their
 56962	regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew
 56963	anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and PÃ©tya
 56964	thought the officers were beginning to look at him and DÃ³lokhov with
 56965	hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.
 56966	
 56967	âIf you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late,â said
 56968	a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.
 56969	
 56970	DÃ³lokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that
 56971	night.
 56972	
 56973	He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and
 56974	squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long
 56975	neck. That officer did not take his eyes from DÃ³lokhov and again asked
 56976	to what regiment he belonged. DÃ³lokhov, as if he had not heard the
 56977	question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took
 56978	from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them
 56979	was safe from Cossacks.
 56980	
 56981	âThose brigands are everywhere,â replied an officer from behind the
 56982	fire.
 56983	
 56984	DÃ³lokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers
 56985	such as his companion and himself, âbut probably they would not dare to
 56986	attack large detachments?â he added inquiringly. No one replied.
 56987	
 56988	âWell, now heâll come away,â PÃ©tya thought every moment as he stood by
 56989	the campfire listening to the talk.
 56990	
 56991	But DÃ³lokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began
 56992	putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion,
 56993	how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about the Russian
 56994	prisoners with that detachment, DÃ³lokhov said:
 56995	
 56996	âA horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would be
 56997	better to shoot such rabble,â and burst into loud laughter, so strange
 56998	that PÃ©tya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise,
 56999	and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.
 57000	
 57001	No one replied a word to DÃ³lokhovâs laughter, and a French officer whom
 57002	they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered
 57003	something to a companion. DÃ³lokhov got up and called to the soldier who
 57004	was holding their horses.
 57005	
 57006	âWill they bring our horses or not?â thought PÃ©tya, instinctively
 57007	drawing nearer to DÃ³lokhov.
 57008	
 57009	The horses were brought.
 57010	
 57011	âGood evening, gentlemen,â said DÃ³lokhov.
 57012	
 57013	PÃ©tya wished to say âGood nightâ but could not utter a word. The
 57014	officers were whispering together. DÃ³lokhov was a long time mounting
 57015	his horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a
 57016	footpace. PÃ©tya rode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or
 57017	not the French were running after them, but not daring to.
 57018	
 57019	Coming out onto the road DÃ³lokhov did not ride back across the open
 57020	country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and listened.
 57021	âDo you hear?â he asked. PÃ©tya recognized the sound of Russian voices
 57022	and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires.
 57023	When they had descended to the bridge PÃ©tya and DÃ³lokhov rode past the
 57024	sentinel, who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then
 57025	they descended into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.
 57026	
 57027	âWell now, good-by. Tell DenÃ­sov, âat the first shot at daybreak,ââ said
 57028	DÃ³lokhov and was about to ride away, but PÃ©tya seized hold of him.
 57029	
 57030	âReally!â he cried, âyou are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid!
 57031	How I love you!â
 57032	
 57033	âAll right, all right!â said DÃ³lokhov. But PÃ©tya did not let go of him
 57034	and DÃ³lokhov saw through the gloom that PÃ©tya was bending toward him and
 57035	wanted to kiss him. DÃ³lokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and
 57036	vanished into the darkness.
 57037	
 57038	
 57039	
 57040	
 57041	
 57042	CHAPTER X
 57043	
 57044	Having returned to the watchmanâs hut, PÃ©tya found DenÃ­sov in the
 57045	passage. He was awaiting PÃ©tyaâs return in a state of agitation,
 57046	anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.
 57047	
 57048	âThank God!â he exclaimed. âYes, thank God!â he repeated, listening to
 57049	PÃ©tyaâs rapturous account. âBut, devil take you, I havenât slept because
 57050	of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before
 57051	morning.â
 57052	
 57053	âBut... no,â said PÃ©tya, âI donât want to sleep yet. Besides I know
 57054	myself, if I fall asleep itâs finished. And then I am used to not
 57055	sleeping before a battle.â
 57056	
 57057	He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his
 57058	expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day.
 57059	
 57060	Then, noticing that DenÃ­sov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.
 57061	
 57062	It was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were still
 57063	falling from the trees. Near the watchmanâs hut the black shapes of the
 57064	Cossacksâ shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen. Behind
 57065	the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them
 57066	were discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red.
 57067	Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the
 57068	sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be
 57069	heard low voices which seemed to be whispering.
 57070	
 57071	PÃ©tya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.
 57072	Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses
 57073	munching their oats. In the dark PÃ©tya recognized his own horse, which
 57074	he called âKarabÃ¡khâ though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.
 57075	
 57076	âWell, KarabÃ¡kh! Weâll do some service tomorrow,â said he, sniffing its
 57077	nostrils and kissing it.
 57078	
 57079	âWhy arenât you asleep, sir?â said a Cossack who was sitting under a
 57080	wagon.
 57081	
 57082	âNo, ah... LikhachÃ«vâisnât that your name? Do you know I have only just
 57083	come back! Weâve been into the French camp.â
 57084	
 57085	And PÃ©tya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but
 57086	also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life
 57087	than to act âjust anyhow.â
 57088	
 57089	âWell, you should get some sleep now,â said the Cossack.
 57090	
 57091	âNo, I am used to this,â said PÃ©tya. âI say, arenât the flints in your
 57092	pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Donât you want any? You can
 57093	have some.â
 57094	
 57095	The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at
 57096	PÃ©tya.
 57097	
 57098	âBecause I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,â said PÃ©tya.
 57099	âSome fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and then
 57100	theyâre sorry for it afterwards. I donât like that.â
 57101	
 57102	âJust so,â said the Cossack.
 57103	
 57104	âOh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my
 57105	saber for me? Itâs got bl...â (PÃ©tya feared to tell a lie, and the saber
 57106	never had been sharpened.) âCan you do it?â
 57107	
 57108	âOf course I can.â
 57109	
 57110	LikhachÃ«v got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon PÃ©tya heard the warlike
 57111	sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its
 57112	edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.
 57113	
 57114	âI say! Are the lads asleep?â asked PÃ©tya.
 57115	
 57116	âSome are, and some arenâtâlike us.â
 57117	
 57118	âWell, and that boy?â
 57119	
 57120	âVesÃ©nny? Oh, heâs thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast asleep
 57121	after his fright. He was that glad!â
 57122	
 57123	After that PÃ©tya remained silent for a long time, listening to the
 57124	sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.
 57125	
 57126	âWhat are you sharpening?â asked a man coming up to the wagon.
 57127	
 57128	âWhy, this gentlemanâs saber.â
 57129	
 57130	âThatâs right,â said the man, whom PÃ©tya took to be an hussar. âWas the
 57131	cup left here?â
 57132	
 57133	âThere, by the wheel!â
 57134	
 57135	The hussar took the cup.
 57136	
 57137	âIt must be daylight soon,â said he, yawning, and went away.
 57138	
 57139	PÃ©tya ought to have known that he was in a forest with DenÃ­sovâs
 57140	guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon
 57141	captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under
 57142	it LikhachÃ«v was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark
 57143	blotch to the right was the watchmanâs hut, and the red blotch below to
 57144	the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had come
 57145	for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor
 57146	waited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom where
 57147	nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be the
 57148	watchmanâs hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of
 57149	the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an
 57150	enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon, but it might
 57151	very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high
 57152	tower from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day or a
 57153	whole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. Perhaps it
 57154	was just the Cossack, LikhachÃ«v, who was sitting under the wagon, but it
 57155	might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the
 57156	world, whom no one knew of. It might really have been that the hussar
 57157	came for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply
 57158	vanishedâdisappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.
 57159	
 57160	Nothing PÃ©tya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in a
 57161	fairy kingdom where everything was possible.
 57162	
 57163	He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth.
 57164	It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly
 57165	sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds
 57166	were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as
 57167	if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising
 57168	high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could
 57169	touch it with oneâs hand.
 57170	
 57171	PÃ©tyaâs eyes began to close and he swayed a little.
 57172	
 57173	The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and
 57174	jostled one another. Someone snored.
 57175	
 57176	âOzheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...â hissed the saber against the whetstone,
 57177	and suddenly PÃ©tya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,
 57178	sweetly solemn hymn. PÃ©tya was as musical as NatÃ¡sha and more so than
 57179	Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the
 57180	melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly
 57181	fresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody
 57182	grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was
 57183	a fugueâthough PÃ©tya had not the least conception of what a fugue is.
 57184	Each instrumentânow resembling a violin and now a horn, but better
 57185	and clearer than violin or hornâplayed its own part, and before it had
 57186	finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the
 57187	same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into
 57188	one and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church
 57189	music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.
 57190	
 57191	âOhâwhy, that was in a dream!â PÃ©tya said to himself, as he lurched
 57192	forward. âItâs in my ears. But perhaps itâs music of my own. Well, go
 57193	on, my music! Now!...â
 57194	
 57195	He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, sounds
 57196	fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again all
 57197	mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. âOh, this is delightful!
 57198	As much as I like and as I like!â said PÃ©tya to himself. He tried to
 57199	conduct that enormous orchestra.
 57200	
 57201	âNow softly, softly die away!â and the sounds obeyed him. âNow fuller,
 57202	more joyful. Still more and more joyful!â And from an unknown depth rose
 57203	increasingly triumphant sounds. âNow voices join in!â ordered PÃ©tya. And
 57204	at first from afar he heard menâs voices and then womenâs. The voices
 57205	grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and PÃ©tya listened to their
 57206	surpassing beauty in awe and joy.
 57207	
 57208	With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the
 57209	trees, and the hissing of the saber, âOzheg-zheg-zheg...â and again the
 57210	horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the choir but
 57211	joining in it.
 57212	
 57213	PÃ©tya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the
 57214	time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to
 57215	share it. He was awakened by LikhachÃ«vâs kindly voice.
 57216	
 57217	âItâs ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!â
 57218	
 57219	PÃ©tya woke up.
 57220	
 57221	âItâs getting light, itâs really getting light!â he exclaimed.
 57222	
 57223	The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their
 57224	very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches.
 57225	PÃ©tya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it
 57226	to LikhachÃ«v; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed
 57227	it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle
 57228	girths.
 57229	
 57230	âAnd hereâs the commander,â said LikhachÃ«v.
 57231	
 57232	DenÃ­sov came out of the watchmanâs hut and, having called PÃ©tya, gave
 57233	orders to get ready.
 57234	
 57235	
 57236	
 57237	
 57238	
 57239	CHAPTER XI
 57240	
 57241	The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, tightened
 57242	their saddle girths, and formed companies. DenÃ­sov stood by the
 57243	watchmanâs hut giving final orders. The infantry of the detachment
 57244	passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist
 57245	of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the mud. The esaul
 57246	gave some orders to his men. PÃ©tya held his horse by the bridle,
 57247	impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face, having been bathed
 57248	in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant.
 57249	Cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.
 57250	
 57251	âWell, is evâwything weady?â asked DenÃ­sov. âBwing the horses.â
 57252	
 57253	The horses were brought. DenÃ­sov was angry with the Cossack because the
 57254	saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. PÃ©tya put his
 57255	foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but
 57256	PÃ©tya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and,
 57257	turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode
 57258	up to DenÃ­sov.
 57259	
 57260	âVasÃ­li DmÃ­trich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for Godâs
 57261	sake...!â said he.
 57262	
 57263	DenÃ­sov seemed to have forgotten PÃ©tyaâs very existence. He turned to
 57264	glance at him.
 57265	
 57266	âI ask one thing of you,â he said sternly, âto obey me and not shove
 57267	yourself forward anywhere.â
 57268	
 57269	He did not say another word to PÃ©tya but rode in silence all the way.
 57270	When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing
 57271	light over the field. DenÃ­sov talked in whispers with the esaul and
 57272	the Cossacks rode past PÃ©tya and DenÃ­sov. When they had all ridden by,
 57273	DenÃ­sov touched his horse and rode down the hill. Slipping onto their
 57274	haunches and sliding, the horses descended with their riders into the
 57275	ravine. PÃ©tya rode beside DenÃ­sov, the pulsation of his body constantly
 57276	increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid
 57277	distant objects. Having reached the valley, DenÃ­sov looked back and
 57278	nodded to a Cossack beside him.
 57279	
 57280	âThe signal!â said he.
 57281	
 57282	The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp
 57283	of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides,
 57284	and then more shots.
 57285	
 57286	At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, PÃ©tya lashed his
 57287	horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding DenÃ­sov who
 57288	shouted at him. It seemed to PÃ©tya that at the moment the shot was
 57289	fired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.
 57290	Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge
 57291	he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on.
 57292	In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were running from right
 57293	to left across the road. One of them fell in the mud under his horseâs
 57294	feet.
 57295	
 57296	Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the midst
 57297	of that crowd terrible screams arose. PÃ©tya galloped up, and the
 57298	first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman,
 57299	clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.
 57300	
 57301	âHurrah!... Lads!... ours!â shouted PÃ©tya, and giving rein to his
 57302	excited horse he galloped forward along the village street.
 57303	
 57304	He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged
 57305	Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,
 57306	were shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking
 57307	Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face,
 57308	had been defending himself against the hussars. When PÃ©tya galloped
 57309	up the Frenchman had already fallen. âToo late again!â flashed through
 57310	PÃ©tyaâs mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing
 57311	could be heard. The shots came from the yard of the landownerâs house
 57312	he had visited the night before with DÃ³lokhov. The French were making
 57313	a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with
 57314	bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the gateway.
 57315	Through the smoke, as he approached the gate, PÃ©tya saw DÃ³lokhov, whose
 57316	face was of a pale-greenish tint, shouting to his men. âGo round! Wait
 57317	for the infantry!â he exclaimed as PÃ©tya rode up to him.
 57318	
 57319	âWait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!â shouted PÃ©tya, and without pausing a moment
 57320	galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
 57321	smoke was thickest.
 57322	
 57323	A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed
 57324	against something. The Cossacks and DÃ³lokhov galloped after PÃ©tya into
 57325	the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the
 57326	French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the
 57327	Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the pond. PÃ©tya was
 57328	galloping along the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved
 57329	both his arms about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther
 57330	to one side in his saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire
 57331	that was smoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and PÃ©tya
 57332	fell heavily on to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and
 57333	legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had
 57334	pierced his skull.
 57335	
 57336	After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house
 57337	with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that
 57338	they surrendered, DÃ³lokhov dismounted and went up to PÃ©tya, who lay
 57339	motionless with outstretched arms.
 57340	
 57341	âDone for!â he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet DenÃ­sov
 57342	who was riding toward him.
 57343	
 57344	âKilled?â cried DenÃ­sov, recognizing from a distance the unmistakably
 57345	lifeless attitudeâvery familiar to himâin which PÃ©tyaâs body was lying.
 57346	
 57347	âDone for!â repeated DÃ³lokhov as if the utterance of these words
 57348	afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who
 57349	were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. âWe wonât take them!â he
 57350	called out to DenÃ­sov.
 57351	
 57352	DenÃ­sov did not reply; he rode up to PÃ©tya, dismounted, and with
 57353	trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered
 57354	face which had already gone white.
 57355	
 57356	âI am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!â he
 57357	recalled PÃ©tyaâs words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the
 57358	sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which DenÃ­sov turned away, walked to
 57359	the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.
 57360	
 57361	Among the Russian prisoners rescued by DenÃ­sov and DÃ³lokhov was Pierre
 57362	BezÃºkhov.
 57363

 57366	
 57367	
 57368	CHAPTER XII
 57369	
 57370	During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been
 57371	issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners
 57372	among whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party was
 57373	no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left
 57374	Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first
 57375	stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other half had gone
 57376	on ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in
 57377	front of the prisoners was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery
 57378	the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was
 57379	now replaced by Marshal Junotâs enormous baggage train, convoyed by
 57380	Westphalians. Behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.
 57381	
 57382	From VyÃ¡zma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in three
 57383	columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder that Pierre
 57384	had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now
 57385	reached the utmost limit.
 57386	
 57387	The road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead
 57388	horses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments
 57389	continually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again
 57390	lagging behind it.
 57391	
 57392	Several times during the march false alarms had been given and the
 57393	soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run
 57394	headlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and
 57395	abused each other for their causeless panic.
 57396	
 57397	These three groups traveling togetherâthe cavalry stores, the convoy of
 57398	prisoners, and Junotâs baggage trainâstill constituted a separate and
 57399	united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.
 57400	
 57401	Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and
 57402	twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been
 57403	captured or left behind. Some of Junotâs wagons also had been captured
 57404	or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers
 57405	from Davoutâs corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that
 57406	a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the
 57407	prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had been
 57408	shot by the marshalâs own order because a silver spoon belonging to the
 57409	marshal had been found in his possession.
 57410	
 57411	The group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three hundred
 57412	and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now
 57413	remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the
 57414	cavalry saddles or Junotâs baggage. They understood that the saddles and
 57415	Junotâs spoon might be of some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers
 57416	should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who
 57417	froze and lagged behind on the road (in which case the order was to
 57418	shoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the
 57419	escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in,
 57420	of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering
 57421	their own plight still worse, treated them with particular moroseness
 57422	and severity.
 57423	
 57424	At DorogobÃºzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the
 57425	prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, several
 57426	of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away, but were
 57427	recaptured by the French and shot.
 57428	
 57429	The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners
 57430	should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned.
 57431	All who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had
 57432	rejoined KaratÃ¡ev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen
 57433	KaratÃ¡ev for its master.
 57434	
 57435	On the third day after leaving Moscow KaratÃ¡ev again fell ill with the
 57436	fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew
 57437	gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know why, but
 57438	since KaratÃ¡ev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to
 57439	go near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which
 57440	KaratÃ¡ev generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled
 57441	the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre
 57442	moved farther away and did not think about him.
 57443	
 57444	While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect
 57445	but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is created for
 57446	happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple
 57447	human needs, and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from
 57448	superfluity. And now during these last three weeks of the march he had
 57449	learned still another new, consolatory truthâthat nothing in this world
 57450	is terrible. He had learned that as there is no condition in which man
 57451	can be happy and entirely free, so there is no condition in which he
 57452	need be unhappy and lack freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom
 57453	have their limits and that those limits are very near together; that the
 57454	person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as
 57455	he now, sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled
 57456	while the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing
 57457	shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet
 57458	that were covered with soresâhis footgear having long since fallen to
 57459	pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wifeâof his own free
 57460	will as it had seemed to himâhe had been no more free than now when they
 57461	locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself subsequently
 57462	termed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt, the worst
 57463	was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh
 57464	was appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder
 57465	they used instead of salt was even pleasant; there was no great cold,
 57466	it was always warm walking in the daytime, and at night there were the
 57467	campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing
 57468	that was at first hard to bear was his feet.
 57469	
 57470	After the second dayâs march Pierre, having examined his feet by the
 57471	campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when
 57472	everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,
 57473	walked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more
 57474	terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now,
 57475	but thought of other things.
 57476	
 57477	Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the
 57478	saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing
 57479	to another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows
 57480	superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit.
 57481	
 57482	He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged
 57483	behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did not
 57484	think of KaratÃ¡ev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon
 57485	have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about himself. The
 57486	harder his position became and the more terrible the future, the more
 57487	independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful
 57488	and comforting thoughts, memories, and imaginings that came to him.
 57489	
 57490	
 57491	
 57492	
 57493	
 57494	CHAPTER XIII
 57495	
 57496	At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill along
 57497	the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the roughness of
 57498	the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and
 57499	then again at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar
 57500	and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side
 57501	of the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction
 57502	lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on
 57503	all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The
 57504	dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow. All around lay
 57505	the flesh of different animalsâfrom men to horsesâin various stages of
 57506	decomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the
 57507	dog could eat all it wanted.
 57508	
 57509	It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it
 57510	might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining
 57511	harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed the water,
 57512	which ran along the ruts in streams.
 57513	
 57514	Pierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps in
 57515	threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally addressing the
 57516	rain, he repeated: âNow then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!â
 57517	
 57518	It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and
 57519	deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and
 57520	comforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a
 57521	conversation with KaratÃ¡ev the day before.
 57522	
 57523	At their yesterdayâs halting place, feeling chilly by a dying campfire,
 57524	Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was burning better.
 57525	There PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev was sitting covered upâhead and allâwith his
 57526	greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his
 57527	effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It
 57528	was already past midnight, the hour when KaratÃ¡ev was usually free of
 57529	his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the fire and
 57530	heard PlatÃ³nâs voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face
 57531	brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His
 57532	feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away,
 57533	but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at
 57534	PlatÃ³n.
 57535	
 57536	âWell, how are you?â he asked.
 57537	
 57538	âHow am I? If we grumble at sickness, God wonât grant us death,â replied
 57539	PlatÃ³n, and at once resumed the story he had begun.
 57540	
 57541	âAnd so, brother,â he continued, with a smile on his pale emaciated face
 57542	and a particularly happy light in his eyes, âyou see, brother...â
 57543	
 57544	Pierre had long been familiar with that story. KaratÃ¡ev had told it
 57545	to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful
 57546	emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that tale as to
 57547	something new, and the quiet rapture KaratÃ¡ev evidently felt as he told
 57548	it communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was of an old merchant
 57549	who lived a good and God-fearing life with his family, and who went once
 57550	to the NÃ­zhni fair with a companionâa rich merchant.
 57551	
 57552	Having put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning his
 57553	companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained knife
 57554	was found under the old merchantâs pillow. He was tried, knouted, and
 57555	his nostrils having been torn off, âall in due formâ as KaratÃ¡ev put it,
 57556	he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.
 57557	
 57558	âAnd so, brotherâ (it was at this point that Pierre came up), âten years
 57559	or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as
 57560	he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one
 57561	night the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among
 57562	them. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they
 57563	had sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had
 57564	taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply
 57565	been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: âWhat
 57566	are you being punished for, Daddy?âââI, my dear brothers,â said he, âam
 57567	being punished for my own and other menâs sins. But I have not killed
 57568	anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my
 57569	poorer brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much
 57570	property. âAnd he went on to tell them all about it in due order. âI
 57571	donât grieve for myself,â he says, âGod, it seems, has chastened me.
 57572	Only I am sorry for my old wife and the children,â and the old man began
 57573	to weep. Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had
 57574	killed the other merchant. âWhere did it happen, Daddy?â he said. âWhen,
 57575	and in what month?â He asked all about it and his heart began to ache.
 57576	So he comes up to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet!
 57577	âYou are perishing because of me, Daddy,â he says. âItâs quite true,
 57578	lads, that this man,â he says, âis being tortured innocently and for
 57579	nothing! I,â he says, âdid that deed, and I put the knife under your
 57580	head while you were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,â he says, âfor Christâs
 57581	sake!ââ
 57582	
 57583	KaratÃ¡ev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and he drew
 57584	the logs together.
 57585	
 57586	âAnd the old man said, âGod will forgive you, we are all sinners in His
 57587	sight. I suffer for my own sins,â and he wept bitter tears. Well,
 57588	and what do you think, dear friends?â KaratÃ¡ev continued, his face
 57589	brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had
 57590	to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story:
 57591	âWhat do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the
 57592	authorities. âI have taken six lives,â he says (he was a great sinner),
 57593	âbut what I am most sorry for is this old man. Donât let him suffer
 57594	because of me.â So he confessed and it was all written down and the
 57595	papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while
 57596	they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the
 57597	papers all in due formâthe authorities I meanâtime passed. The affair
 57598	reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsarâs decree came: to set the
 57599	merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The
 57600	paper arrived and they began to look for the old man. âWhere is the old
 57601	man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A paper has come from
 57602	the Tsar!â so they began looking for him,â here KaratÃ¡evâs lower jaw
 57603	trembled, âbut God had already forgiven himâhe was dead! Thatâs how it
 57604	was, dear fellows!â KaratÃ¡ev concluded and sat for a long time silent,
 57605	gazing before him with a smile.
 57606	
 57607	And Pierreâs soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself
 57608	but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up
 57609	KaratÃ¡evâs face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy.
 57610	
 57611	
 57612	
 57613	
 57614	
 57615	CHAPTER XIV
 57616	
 57617	âÃ vos places!â * suddenly cried a voice.
 57618	
 57619	    * âTo your places.â
 57620	
 57621	
 57622	A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something
 57623	joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the
 57624	prisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left came
 57625	smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the prisoners at a
 57626	trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the
 57627	approach of those in authority. The prisoners thronged together and were
 57628	pushed off the road. The convoy formed up.
 57629	
 57630	âThe Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!â and hardly had the
 57631	sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled
 57632	by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a
 57633	tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the
 57634	marshals. His eye fell on Pierreâs large and striking figure, and in
 57635	the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he
 57636	detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.
 57637	
 57638	The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a
 57639	red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several officers
 57640	formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their faces all
 57641	looked excited and worried.
 57642	
 57643	âWhat did he say? What did he say?â Pierre heard them ask.
 57644	
 57645	While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a
 57646	crowd, and Pierre saw KaratÃ¡ev whom he had not yet seen that morning.
 57647	He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face,
 57648	besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling
 57649	the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently, there was now an
 57650	expression of quiet solemnity.
 57651	
 57652	KaratÃ¡ev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with
 57653	tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to
 57654	him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he
 57655	did not notice that look and moved hastily away.
 57656	
 57657	When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. KaratÃ¡ev
 57658	was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two
 57659	Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again
 57660	but went limping up the hill.
 57661	
 57662	From behind, where KaratÃ¡ev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot.
 57663	Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he
 57664	had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to
 57665	SmolÃ©nskâa calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And he
 57666	again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of
 57667	whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and
 57668	in the expression on their facesâone of them glanced timidly at
 57669	Pierreâthere was something resembling what he had seen on the face of
 57670	the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and
 57671	remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while
 57672	drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.
 57673	
 57674	Behind him, where KaratÃ¡ev had been sitting, the dog began to howl.
 57675	âWhat a stupid beast! Why is it howling?â thought Pierre.
 57676	
 57677	His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking
 57678	back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling,
 57679	just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces.
 57680	
 57681	
 57682	
 57683	
 57684	
 57685	CHAPTER XV
 57686	
 57687	The stores, the prisoners, and the marshalâs baggage train stopped at
 57688	the village of ShÃ¡mshevo. The men crowded together round the campfires.
 57689	Pierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his
 57690	back to the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again slept as he had
 57691	done at MozhÃ¡ysk after the battle of BorodinÃ³.
 57692	
 57693	Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or another,
 57694	gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had
 57695	been expressed in his dream at MozhÃ¡ysk.
 57696	
 57697	âLife is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and that
 57698	movement is God. And while there is life there is joy in consciousness
 57699	of the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and more blessed
 57700	than all else is to love this life in oneâs sufferings, in innocent
 57701	sufferings.â
 57702	
 57703	âKaratÃ¡ev!â came to Pierreâs mind.
 57704	
 57705	And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly old man
 57706	who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. âWait a bit,â said
 57707	the old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was aliveâa vibrating
 57708	ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted of drops
 57709	closely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed places,
 57710	sometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one dividing
 57711	into many. Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as
 57712	possible, but others striving to do the same compressed it, sometimes
 57713	destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.
 57714	
 57715	âThat is life,â said the old teacher.
 57716	
 57717	âHow simple and clear it is,â thought Pierre. âHow is it I did not know
 57718	it before?â
 57719	
 57720	âGod is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect
 57721	Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from the
 57722	surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now, KaratÃ¡ev
 57723	has spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?â said the
 57724	teacher.
 57725	
 57726	âDo you understand, damn you?â shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.
 57727	
 57728	He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian
 57729	soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece
 57730	of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy,
 57731	hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod. His
 57732	brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of
 57733	the charcoal.
 57734	
 57735	âItâs all the same to him,â he muttered, turning quickly to a soldier
 57736	who stood behind him. âBrigand! Get away!â
 57737	
 57738	And twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned
 57739	away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier the
 57740	Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something
 57741	with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog,
 57742	sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.
 57743	
 57744	âAh, heâs come?â said Pierre. âAnd Platââ he began, but did not finish.
 57745	
 57746	Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancyâof
 57747	the look PlatÃ³n had given him as he sat under the tree, of the shot
 57748	heard from that spot, of the dogâs howl, of the guilty faces of the two
 57749	Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of
 57750	KaratÃ¡evâs absence at this haltâand he was on the point of realizing
 57751	that KaratÃ¡ev had been killed, but just at that instant, he knew not
 57752	why, the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent
 57753	with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And
 57754	without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion
 57755	from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in
 57756	summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating
 57757	globe, and he sank into water so that it closed over his head.
 57758	
 57759	Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing.
 57760	French soldiers were running past him.
 57761	
 57762	âThe Cossacks!â one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of
 57763	Russians surrounded Pierre.
 57764	
 57765	For a long time he could not understand what was happening to him. All
 57766	around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.
 57767	
 57768	âBrothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!â old soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as
 57769	they embraced Cossacks and hussars.
 57770	
 57771	The hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered them
 57772	clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he sat
 57773	among them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier who
 57774	approached him, and kissed him, weeping.
 57775	
 57776	DÃ³lokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd
 57777	of disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had
 57778	happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed
 57779	DÃ³lokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them
 57780	with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent. On the
 57781	opposite side stood DÃ³lokhovâs Cossack, counting the prisoners and
 57782	marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate.
 57783	
 57784	âHow many?â DÃ³lokhov asked the Cossack.
 57785	
 57786	âThe second hundred,â replied the Cossack.
 57787	
 57788	âFilez, filez!â * DÃ³lokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression
 57789	from the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they
 57790	flashed with a cruel light.
 57791	
 57792	    * âGet along, get along!â
 57793	
 57794	
 57795	DenÃ­sov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks
 57796	who were carrying the body of PÃ©tya RostÃ³v to a hole that had been dug
 57797	in the garden.
 57798	
 57799	
 57800	
 57801	
 57802	
 57803	CHAPTER XVI
 57804	
 57805	After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of
 57806	the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing,
 57807	or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages
 57808	with people dressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the
 57809	property that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but
 57810	the process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on
 57811	essentially as before.
 57812	
 57813	From Moscow to VyÃ¡zma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not
 57814	reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but pillage)
 57815	was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five thousand
 57816	had fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding terms of the
 57817	progression could be determined mathematically. The French army melted
 57818	away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to VyÃ¡zma, from VyÃ¡zma
 57819	to SmolÃ©nsk, from SmolÃ©nsk to the BerÃ«zina, and from the BerÃ«zina to
 57820	VÃ­lnaâindependently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the
 57821	pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions.
 57822	Beyond VyÃ¡zma the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled
 57823	together into one mass, and so went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his
 57824	Emperor (we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge
 57825	from the truth in describing the condition of an army) and this is what
 57826	he said:
 57827	
 57828	
 57829	I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the various
 57830	corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last
 57831	two or three daysâ march. They are almost disbanded. Scarcely a quarter
 57832	of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others
 57833	go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and
 57834	escape discipline. In general they regard SmolÃ©nsk as the place where
 57835	they hope to recover. During the last few days many of the men have been
 57836	seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms. In such a state
 57837	of affairs, whatever your ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your
 57838	Majestyâs service demands that the army should be rallied at SmolÃ©nsk
 57839	and should first of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted
 57840	cavalry, unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no longer
 57841	in proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who are worn out with
 57842	hunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well as a few daysâ rest.
 57843	Many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This
 57844	state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that
 57845	unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under
 57846	control in case of an engagement.
 57847	
 57848	November 9: twenty miles from SmolÃ©nsk.
 57849	
 57850	
 57851	After staggering into SmolÃ©nsk which seemed to them a promised land, the
 57852	French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own stores,
 57853	and when everything had been plundered fled farther.
 57854	
 57855	They all went without knowing whither or why they were going. Still less
 57856	did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to
 57857	him. But still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote
 57858	commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one another
 57859	sire, mon cousin, prince dâEckmÃ¼hl, roi de Naples, and so on. But these
 57860	orders and reports were only on paper, nothing in them was acted upon
 57861	for they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one
 57862	another Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, they all felt that they were
 57863	miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to
 57864	pay. And though they pretended to be concerned about the army, each
 57865	was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save
 57866	himself.
 57867	
 57868	
 57869	
 57870	
 57871	
 57872	CHAPTER XVII
 57873	
 57874	The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign
 57875	from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian
 57876	blindmanâs buff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of
 57877	them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his
 57878	whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into
 57879	a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to
 57880	escape runs straight into his opponentâs arms.
 57881	
 57882	At first while they were still moving along the KalÃºga road, Napoleonâs
 57883	armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the
 57884	SmolÃ©nsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tightâand often
 57885	thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.
 57886	
 57887	Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit
 57888	and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of
 57889	approximately ascertaining the enemyâs positionâby cavalry scoutingâwas
 57890	not available. Besides, as a result of the frequent and rapid change of
 57891	position by each army, even what information was obtained could not be
 57892	delivered in time. If news was received one day that the enemy had been
 57893	in a certain position the day before, by the third day when something
 57894	could have been done, that army was already two daysâ march farther on
 57895	and in quite another position.
 57896	
 57897	One army fled and the other pursued. Beyond SmolÃ©nsk there were several
 57898	different roads available for the French, and one would have thought
 57899	that during their stay of four days they might have learned where
 57900	the enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan and
 57901	undertaken something new. But after a four daysâ halt the mob, with no
 57902	maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither
 57903	to the right nor to the left but along the oldâthe worstâroad, through
 57904	KrÃ¡snoe and OrshÃ¡.
 57905	
 57906	Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated
 57907	in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours. In
 57908	front of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. The
 57909	Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond
 57910	the Dnieperâwhich was the only reasonable thing for him to doâthemselves
 57911	turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at KrÃ¡snoe. And here
 57912	as in a game of blindmanâs buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing
 57913	their enemy unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped
 57914	short from the sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight,
 57915	abandoning their comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days
 57916	separate portions of the French armyâfirst Muratâs (the vice-kingâs),
 57917	then Davoutâs, and then Neyâsâran, as it were, the gauntlet of the
 57918	Russian army. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy
 57919	baggage, their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the
 57920	Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.
 57921	
 57922	Ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of
 57923	SmolÃ©nsk which were in nobodyâs way, because despite the unfortunate
 57924	plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor
 57925	against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of ten
 57926	thousand men, reached Napoleon at OrshÃ¡ with only one thousand men left,
 57927	having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having crossed the
 57928	Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.
 57929	
 57930	From OrshÃ¡ they fled farther along the road to VÃ­lna, still playing
 57931	at blindmanâs buff with the pursuing army. At the BerÃ«zina they again
 57932	became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those
 57933	who got across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a
 57934	fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone,
 57935	abandoning his companions. The others who could do so drove away too,
 57936	leaving those who could not to surrender or die.
 57937	
 57938	
 57939	
 57940	
 57941	
 57942	CHAPTER XVIII
 57943	
 57944	This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did
 57945	all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they turned onto
 57946	the KalÃºga road to the day their leader fled from the army, none of the
 57947	movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might have thought that
 57948	regarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed
 57949	the actions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it
 57950	impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory. But
 57951	no! Mountains of books have been written by the historians about this
 57952	campaign, and everywhere are described Napoleonâs arrangements, the
 57953	maneuvers, and his profound plans which guided the army, as well as the
 57954	military genius shown by his marshals.
 57955	
 57956	The retreat from MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets when he had a free road into a
 57957	well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along
 57958	which KutÃºzov afterwards pursued himâthis unnecessary retreat along
 57959	a devastated roadâis explained to us as being due to profound
 57960	considerations. Similarly profound considerations are given for
 57961	his retreat from SmolÃ©nsk to OrshÃ¡. Then his heroism at KrÃ¡snoe is
 57962	described, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle
 57963	and take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick
 57964	and said:
 57965	
 57966	âJâai assez fait lâempereur; il est temps de faire le gÃ©nÃ©ral,â * but
 57967	nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the
 57968	scattered fragments of the army he left behind.
 57969	
 57970	     * âI have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act
 57971	     the general.â
 57972	
 57973	
 57974	Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, especially
 57975	of Neyâa greatness of soul consisting in this: that he made his way by
 57976	night around through the forest and across the Dnieper and escaped to
 57977	OrshÃ¡, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his men.
 57978	
 57979	And lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic
 57980	army is presented to us by the historians as something great and
 57981	characteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in
 57982	ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child
 57983	is taught to be ashamed ofâeven that act finds justification in the
 57984	historiansâ language.
 57985	
 57986	When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical
 57987	ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly contrary to all
 57988	that humanity calls right or even just, the historians produce a saving
 57989	conception of âgreatness.â âGreatness,â it seems, excludes the standards
 57990	of right and wrong. For the âgreatâ man nothing is wrong, there is no
 57991	atrocity for which a âgreatâ man can be blamed.
 57992	
 57993	âCâest grand!â * say the historians, and there no longer exists either
 57994	good or evil but only âgrandâ and ânot grand.â Grand is good, not
 57995	grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of some
 57996	special animals called âheroes.â And Napoleon, escaping home in a warm
 57997	fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades
 57998	but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que câest
 57999	grand, *(2) and his soul is tranquil.
 58000	
 58001	     * âIt is great.â
 58002	
 58003	     * (2) That it is great.
 58004	
 58005	âDu sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il nây
 58006	a quâun pas,â * said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been
 58007	repeating: âSublime! Grand! NapolÃ©on le Grand!â Du sublime au ridicule
 58008	il nây a quâun pas.
 58009	
 58010	    * âFrom the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.â
 58011	
 58012	
 58013	And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with
 58014	the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit oneâs own nothingness
 58015	and immeasurable meanness.
 58016	
 58017	For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human
 58018	actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity,
 58019	goodness, and truth are absent.
 58020	
 58021	
 58022	
 58023	
 58024	
 58025	CHAPTER XIX
 58026	
 58027	What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign
 58028	of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,
 58029	dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is
 58030	that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies
 58031	surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry
 58032	and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate)
 58033	the aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and
 58034	capture them all?
 58035	
 58036	How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the
 58037	French had given battle at BorodinÃ³, did not achieve its purpose when it
 58038	had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture
 58039	them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had
 58040	surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could
 58041	that happen?
 58042	
 58043	History (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions
 58044	says that this occurred because KutÃºzov and TormÃ¡sov and ChichagÃ³v, and
 58045	this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers....
 58046	
 58047	But why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were
 58048	guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and
 58049	punished? But even if we admitted that KutÃºzov, ChichagÃ³v, and others
 58050	were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehensible
 58051	why, the position of the Russian army being what it was at KrÃ¡snoe and
 58052	at the BerÃ«zina (in both cases we had superior forces), the French army
 58053	with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not captured, if that was what
 58054	the Russians aimed at.
 58055	
 58056	The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military
 58057	historians (to the effect that KutÃºzov hindered an attack) is unfounded,
 58058	for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at
 58059	VyÃ¡zma and TarÃºtino.
 58060	
 58061	Why was the Russian armyâwhich with inferior forces had withstood the
 58062	enemy in full strength at BorodinÃ³âdefeated at KrÃ¡snoe and the BerÃ«zina
 58063	by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically
 58064	superior?
 58065	
 58066	If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing
 58067	Napoleon and his marshalsâand that aim was not merely frustrated but all
 58068	attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffledâthen this last period
 58069	of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a
 58070	series of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian
 58071	historians.
 58072	
 58073	The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims
 58074	of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical
 58075	rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit
 58076	that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for
 58077	Napoleon and defeats for KutÃºzov.
 58078	
 58079	But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
 58080	conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French
 58081	victories brought the French complete destruction, while the series
 58082	of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
 58083	liberation of their country.
 58084	
 58085	The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians
 58086	studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals,
 58087	from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this
 58088	last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of
 58089	cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.
 58090	
 58091	There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been
 58092	senseless and its attainment quite impossible.
 58093	
 58094	It would have been senseless, first because Napoleonâs disorganized
 58095	army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that is to say, was
 58096	doing just what every Russian desired. So what was the use of performing
 58097	various operations on the French who were running away as fast as they
 58098	possibly could?
 58099	
 58100	Secondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose
 58101	whole energy was directed to flight.
 58102	
 58103	Thirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice oneâs own troops in
 58104	order to destroy the French army, which without external interference
 58105	was destroying itself at such a rate that, though its path was not
 58106	blocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually
 58107	did in December, namely a hundredth part of the original army.
 58108	
 58109	Fourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the
 58110	Emperor, kings, and dukesâwhose capture would have been in the highest
 58111	degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit diplomatists of
 58112	the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. Still more senseless
 58113	would have been the wish to capture army corps of the French, when our
 58114	own army had melted away to half before reaching KrÃ¡snoe and a whole
 58115	division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and
 58116	when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners
 58117	already taken were perishing of hunger.
 58118	
 58119	All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his
 58120	army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of
 58121	his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should
 58122	run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said
 58123	in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even
 58124	that could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not
 58125	they who had suffered from the trampled beds.
 58126	
 58127	But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have
 58128	been senseless, it was impossible.
 58129	
 58130	It was impossible first becauseâas experience shows that a three-mile
 58131	movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plansâthe
 58132	probability of ChichagÃ³v, KutÃºzov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction
 58133	on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to
 58134	impossibility, as in fact thought KutÃºzov, who when he received the plan
 58135	remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the
 58136	desired results.
 58137	
 58138	Secondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with which
 58139	Napoleonâs army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the
 58140	Russians possessed would have been required.
 58141	
 58142	Thirdly it was impossible, because the military term âto cut offâ has no
 58143	meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut off
 58144	an armyâto bar its roadâis quite impossible, for there is always plenty
 58145	of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be
 58146	seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the
 58147	example of KrÃ¡snoe and of the BerÃ«zina. It is only possible to capture
 58148	prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible
 58149	to catch a swallow if it settles on oneâs hand. Men can only be taken
 58150	prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and
 58151	tactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops quite rightly did not
 58152	consider that this suited them, since death by hunger and cold awaited
 58153	them in flight or captivity alike.
 58154	
 58155	Fourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world
 58156	began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained
 58157	in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its
 58158	strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying
 58159	itself.
 58160	
 58161	During the movement of the Russian army from TarÃºtino to KrÃ¡snoe it
 58162	lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the
 58163	population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of the army
 58164	without a battle.
 58165	
 58166	And it is of this period of the campaignâwhen the army lacked boots
 58167	and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and
 58168	was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees
 58169	of frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and
 58170	the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be
 58171	maintained, when men were taken into that region of death where
 58172	discipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for
 58173	months, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and
 58174	cold, when half the army perished in a single monthâit is of this period
 58175	of the campaign that the historians tell us how MilorÃ¡dovich should have
 58176	made a flank march to such and such a place, TormÃ¡sov to another place,
 58177	and ChichagÃ³v should have crossed (more than knee-deep in snow) to
 58178	somewhere else, and how so-and-so âroutedâ and âcut offâ the French and
 58179	so on and so on.
 58180	
 58181	The Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been
 58182	done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame
 58183	because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should
 58184	do what was impossible.
 58185	
 58186	All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the
 58187	facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians
 58188	dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words
 58189	and sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.
 58190	
 58191	To them the words of MilorÃ¡dovich seem very interesting, and so do their
 58192	surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question
 58193	of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves
 58194	does not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of
 58195	their investigation.
 58196	
 58197	Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and
 58198	consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a
 58199	direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble
 58200	easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.
 58201	
 58202	The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in
 58203	the imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it was
 58204	senseless and unattainable.
 58205	
 58206	The people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. That aim
 58207	was attained in the first place of itself, as the French ran away,
 58208	and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight. Secondly it was
 58209	attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the French, and
 58210	thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was following the French,
 58211	ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped.
 58212	
 58213	The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the
 58214	experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a
 58215	menace than to strike the running animal on the head.

 58227	CHAPTER I
 58228	
 58229	When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror: substance
 58230	similar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But when it is a
 58231	beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this horror at
 58232	the extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual wound, which
 58233	like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals, but always
 58234	aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.
 58235	
 58236	After Prince Andrewâs death NatÃ¡sha and Princess Mary alike felt this.
 58237	Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of
 58238	death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face. They
 58239	carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact.
 58240	Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to
 58241	dinner, the maidâs inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any
 58242	word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully
 58243	irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary quiet in which
 58244	they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still
 58245	resounded in their imagination, and hindered their gazing into those
 58246	mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before
 58247	them.
 58248	
 58249	Only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain.
 58250	They spoke little even to one another, and when they did it was of very
 58251	unimportant matters.
 58252	
 58253	Both avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of
 58254	a future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did
 58255	they avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them that
 58256	what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in
 58257	words, and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the
 58258	majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before
 58259	their eyes.
 58260	
 58261	Continued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of everything
 58262	that might lead up to the subjectâthis halting on all sides at the
 58263	boundary of what they might not mentionâbrought before their minds with
 58264	still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling.
 58265	
 58266	But pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy.
 58267	Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of
 58268	her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was the first to
 58269	be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt
 58270	for the first fortnight. She received letters from her relations to
 58271	which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put
 58272	was damp and he began to cough; AlpÃ¡tych came to YaroslÃ¡vl with reports
 58273	on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they
 58274	should return to Moscow to the house on the VozdvÃ­zhenka Street, which
 58275	had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs. Life did not
 58276	stand still and it was necessary to live. Hard as it was for Princess
 58277	Mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she
 58278	had lived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave
 58279	NatÃ¡sha alone, yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she
 58280	involuntarily yielded to them. She went through the accounts with
 58281	AlpÃ¡tych, conferred with Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and
 58282	made preparations for the journey to Moscow.
 58283	
 58284	NatÃ¡sha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making
 58285	preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.
 58286	
 58287	Princess Mary asked the countess to let NatÃ¡sha go with her to Moscow,
 58288	and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw their daughter
 58289	losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the
 58290	advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.
 58291	
 58292	âI am not going anywhere,â NatÃ¡sha replied when this was proposed to
 58293	her. âDo please just leave me alone!â And she ran out of the room, with
 58294	difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than
 58295	of sorrow.
 58296	
 58297	After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief,
 58298	NatÃ¡sha spent most of the time in her room by herself, sitting huddled
 58299	up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and twisting
 58300	something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and
 58301	fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This solitude exhausted
 58302	and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as anyone
 58303	entered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and
 58304	picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the
 58305	intruder to go.
 58306	
 58307	She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that
 58308	on whichâwith a terrible questioning too great for her strengthâher
 58309	spiritual gaze was fixed.
 58310	
 58311	One day toward the end of December NatÃ¡sha, pale and thin, dressed in a
 58312	black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was
 58313	crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and
 58314	smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the
 58315	door.
 58316	
 58317	She was gazing in the direction in which he had goneâto the other side
 58318	of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never before
 58319	thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable,
 58320	was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of
 58321	life, where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering
 58322	and indignity.
 58323	
 58324	She was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine him
 58325	otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he had been
 58326	at MytÃ­shchi, at TrÃ³itsa, and at YaroslÃ¡vl.
 58327	
 58328	She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own, and
 58329	sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.
 58330	
 58331	There he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning
 58332	his head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his
 58333	shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and a
 58334	wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs twitches
 58335	just perceptibly, but rapidly. NatÃ¡sha knows that he is struggling with
 58336	terrible pain. âWhat is that pain like? Why does he have that pain? What
 58337	does he feel? How does it hurt him?â thought NatÃ¡sha. He noticed her
 58338	watching him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:
 58339	
 58340	âOne thing would be terrible,â said he: âto bind oneself forever to a
 58341	suffering man. It would be continual torture.â And he looked searchingly
 58342	at her. NatÃ¡sha as usual answered before she had time to think what she
 58343	would say. She said: âThis canât go onâit wonât. You will get wellâquite
 58344	well.â
 58345	
 58346	She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she
 58347	had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words
 58348	and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted
 58349	gaze.
 58350	
 58351	âI agreed,â NatÃ¡sha now said to herself, âthat it would be dreadful if
 58352	he always continued to suffer. I said it then only because it would have
 58353	been dreadful for him, but he understood it differently. He thought it
 58354	would be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live and feared death.
 58355	And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I meant.
 58356	I thought quite differently. Had I said what I thought, I should have
 58357	said: even if he had to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes,
 58358	I should have been happy compared with what I am now. Now there is
 58359	nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not and never will know
 58360	it. And now it will never, never be possible to put it right.â And
 58361	now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her, only in her
 58362	imagination NatÃ¡sha this time gave him a different answer. She stopped
 58363	him and said: âTerrible for you, but not for me! You know that for me
 58364	there is nothing in life but you, and to suffer with you is the greatest
 58365	happiness for me,â and he took her hand and pressed it as he had
 58366	pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death. And in her
 58367	imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have
 58368	said then but only spoke now: âI love thee!... thee! I love, love...â
 58369	she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a
 58370	desperate effort....
 58371	
 58372	She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her
 58373	eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.
 58374	Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a
 58375	strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now
 58376	it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the instant
 58377	when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a
 58378	loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears. DunyÃ¡sha,
 58379	her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look
 58380	on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.
 58381	
 58382	âCome to your Papa at once, please!â said she with a strange, excited
 58383	look. âA misfortune... about Peter IlÃ½nich... a letter,â she finished
 58384	with a sob.
 58385	
 58386	
 58387	
 58388	
 58389	
 58390	CHAPTER II
 58391	
 58392	Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody NatÃ¡sha was feeling a
 58393	special estrangement from the members of her own family. All of
 58394	themâher father, mother, and SÃ³nyaâwere so near to her, so familiar, so
 58395	commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the
 58396	world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not merely
 58397	indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard
 58398	DunyÃ¡shaâs words about Peter IlÃ½nich and a misfortune, but did not grasp
 58399	them.
 58400	
 58401	âWhat misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live
 58402	their own old, quiet, and commonplace life,â thought NatÃ¡sha.
 58403	
 58404	As she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of
 58405	her motherâs room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He
 58406	had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were
 58407	choking him. When he saw NatÃ¡sha he waved his arms despairingly and
 58408	burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face.
 58409	
 58410	âPe... PÃ©tya... Go, go, she... is calling...â and weeping like a child
 58411	and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost fell into
 58412	it, covering his face with his hands.
 58413	
 58414	Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through NatÃ¡shaâs whole being.
 58415	Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache as if
 58416	something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But the pain
 58417	was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive
 58418	constraint that had prevented her taking part in life. The sight of her
 58419	father, the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the
 58420	door, made her immediately forget herself and her own grief.
 58421	
 58422	She ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to her
 58423	motherâs door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came out
 58424	from that room and taking NatÃ¡sha by the arm said something to her.
 58425	NatÃ¡sha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, pausing
 58426	at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself, and then ran
 58427	to her mother.
 58428	
 58429	The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position,
 58430	stretching out and beating her head against the wall. SÃ³nya and the
 58431	maids were holding her arms.
 58432	
 58433	âNatÃ¡sha! NatÃ¡sha!...â cried the countess. âItâs not true... itâs not
 58434	true... Heâs lying... NatÃ¡sha!â she shrieked, pushing those around her
 58435	away. âGo away, all of you; itâs not true! Killed!... ha, ha, ha!...
 58436	Itâs not true!â
 58437	
 58438	NatÃ¡sha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother, embraced
 58439	her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face toward
 58440	herself, and clung to her.
 58441	
 58442	âMummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy,â she kept on
 58443	whispering, not pausing an instant.
 58444	
 58445	She did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her,
 58446	demanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her
 58447	motherâs dress.
 58448	
 58449	âMy dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...â she whispered
 58450	incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her own
 58451	irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.
 58452	
 58453	The countess pressed her daughterâs hand, closed her eyes, and became
 58454	quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness,
 58455	glanced vacantly around her, and seeing NatÃ¡sha began to press her
 58456	daughterâs head with all her strength. Then she turned toward her
 58457	daughterâs face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it.
 58458	
 58459	âNatÃ¡sha, you love me?â she said in a soft trustful whisper. âNatÃ¡sha,
 58460	you would not deceive me? Youâll tell me the whole truth?â
 58461	
 58462	NatÃ¡sha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was
 58463	nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.
 58464	
 58465	âMy darling Mummy!â she repeated, straining all the power of her love to
 58466	find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her
 58467	mother.
 58468	
 58469	And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing to
 58470	believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom
 58471	of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.
 58472	
 58473	NatÃ¡sha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the
 58474	next day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother. Her
 58475	persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess
 58476	every moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling her to life.
 58477	
 58478	During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes,
 58479	and NatÃ¡sha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes,
 58480	but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was
 58481	sitting up in bed and speaking softly.
 58482	
 58483	âHow glad I am you have come. You are tired. Wonât you have some tea?â
 58484	NatÃ¡sha went up to her. âYou have improved in looks and grown more
 58485	manly,â continued the countess, taking her daughterâs hand.
 58486	
 58487	âMamma! What are you saying...â
 58488	
 58489	âNatÃ¡sha, he is no more, no more!â
 58490	
 58491	And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first
 58492	time.
 58493	
 58494	
 58495	
 58496	
 58497	
 58498	CHAPTER III
 58499	
 58500	Princess Mary postponed her departure. SÃ³nya and the count tried to
 58501	replace NatÃ¡sha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to
 58502	restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks NatÃ¡sha
 58503	remained constantly at her motherâs side, sleeping on a lounge chair
 58504	in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly
 58505	because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her
 58506	mother.
 58507	
 58508	The motherâs wounded spirit could not heal. PÃ©tyaâs death had torn from
 58509	her half her life. When the news of PÃ©tyaâs death had come she had been
 58510	a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room
 58511	a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that
 58512	almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored NatÃ¡sha to life.
 58513	
 58514	A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like
 58515	a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may
 58516	heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet
 58517	heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.
 58518	
 58519	NatÃ¡shaâs wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended,
 58520	but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of
 58521	lifeâloveâwas still active within her. Love awoke and so did life.
 58522	
 58523	Prince Andrewâs last days had bound Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha together;
 58524	this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary
 58525	put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after NatÃ¡sha as if
 58526	she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her motherâs bedroom
 58527	had strained NatÃ¡shaâs physical strength.
 58528	
 58529	One afternoon noticing NatÃ¡sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took
 58530	her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. NatÃ¡sha lay down,
 58531	but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she
 58532	called her back.
 58533	
 58534	âI donât want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.â
 58535	
 58536	âYou are tiredâtry to sleep.â
 58537	
 58538	âNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.â
 58539	
 58540	âShe is much better. She spoke so well today,â said Princess Mary.
 58541	
 58542	NatÃ¡sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned
 58543	Princess Maryâs face.
 58544	
 58545	âIs she like him?â thought NatÃ¡sha. âYes, like and yet not like. But she
 58546	is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What
 58547	is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What
 58548	does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!â
 58549	
 58550	âMary,â she said timidly, drawing Princess Maryâs hand to herself,
 58551	âMary, you mustnât think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you!
 58552	Let us be quite, quite friends.â
 58553	
 58554	And NatÃ¡sha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making
 58555	Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings.
 58556	
 58557	From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only
 58558	between women was established between Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha. They
 58559	were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and
 58560	spent most of their time together. When one went out the other became
 58561	restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony
 58562	with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A
 58563	feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive
 58564	feeling of life being possible only in each otherâs presence.
 58565	
 58566	Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already
 58567	in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They spoke most
 58568	of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her
 58569	mother, her father, and her daydreams; and NatÃ¡sha, who with a passive
 58570	lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of
 58571	devotion, submission, and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice, now
 58572	feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her
 58573	past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to
 58574	her. She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her
 58575	own life, for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood
 58576	and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For
 58577	Princess Mary, listening to NatÃ¡shaâs tales of childhood and early
 58578	youth, there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of
 58579	life: belief in life and its enjoyment.
 58580	
 58581	Just as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they
 58582	thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him had
 58583	the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being
 58584	conscious of it.
 58585	
 58586	NatÃ¡sha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all
 58587	talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was
 58588	suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness,
 58589	and loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm
 58590	carefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her
 58591	drawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed to
 58592	her that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.
 58593	
 58594	One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.
 58595	Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and
 58596	then, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.
 58597	
 58598	Another time when she called DunyÃ¡sha her voice trembled, so she called
 58599	againâthough she could hear DunyÃ¡sha comingâcalled her in the deep chest
 58600	tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened attentively to
 58601	herself.
 58602	
 58603	She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer
 58604	of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate
 58605	young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so
 58606	cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that
 58607	it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal
 58608	from within.
 58609	
 58610	At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count
 58611	insisted on NatÃ¡shaâs going with her to consult the doctors.
 58612	
 58613	
 58614	
 58615	
 58616	
 58617	CHAPTER IV
 58618	
 58619	After the encounter at VyÃ¡zma, where KutÃºzov had been unable to hold
 58620	back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and
 58621	so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians
 58622	who pursued them, continued as far as KrÃ¡snoe without a battle. The
 58623	flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could
 58624	not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the
 58625	information received of the movements of the French was never reliable.
 58626	
 58627	The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching
 58628	at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any
 58629	faster.
 58630	
 58631	To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only
 58632	necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not
 58633	losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after TarÃºtino and
 58634	less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a
 58635	hundred thousand strong reached KrÃ¡snoe with only fifty thousand.
 58636	
 58637	The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army
 58638	as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that
 58639	the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction
 58640	as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind
 58641	in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their
 58642	own people. The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleonâs army was
 58643	the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the
 58644	corresponding decrease of the Russian army.
 58645	
 58646	KutÃºzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the
 58647	movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian
 58648	army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at
 58649	TarÃºtino and VyÃ¡zma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our
 58650	army.
 58651	
 58652	But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the
 58653	army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another
 58654	reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to KutÃºzov.
 58655	The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the
 58656	French would take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on
 58657	their heels the greater distance they had to cover. Only by following
 58658	at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All
 58659	the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of
 58660	the army and a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable
 58661	aim was to shorten those marches. To that end KutÃºzovâs activity was
 58662	directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to VÃ­lnaânot casually or
 58663	intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it.
 58664	
 58665	KutÃºzov felt and knewânot by reasoning or science but with the whole of
 58666	his Russian beingâwhat every Russian soldier felt: that the French were
 58667	beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the
 58668	same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march,
 58669	the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.
 58670	
 58671	But to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army,
 58672	who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some
 58673	reason to capture a king or a dukeâit seemed that nowâwhen any battle
 58674	must be horrible and senselessâwas the very time to fight and conquer
 58675	somebody. KutÃºzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after
 58676	another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those
 58677	soldiersâill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starvedâwho within a
 58678	month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number,
 58679	and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater
 58680	distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the
 58681	frontier.
 58682	
 58683	This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and
 58684	to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on
 58685	the French army.
 58686	
 58687	So it was at KrÃ¡snoe, where they expected to find one of the three
 58688	French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen
 58689	thousand men. Despite all KutÃºzovâs efforts to avoid that ruinous
 58690	encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob
 58691	of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at KrÃ¡snoe for three
 58692	days.
 58693	
 58694	Toll wrote a disposition: âThe first column will march to so and so,â
 58695	etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition.
 58696	Prince EugÃ¨ne of WÃ¼rttemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds
 58697	that were running past, and demanded reinforcements which did not
 58698	arrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and hid themselves
 58699	in the forest by night, making their way round as best they could, and
 58700	continued their flight.
 58701	
 58702	MilorÃ¡dovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the
 58703	commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found when
 58704	he was wantedâthat chevalier sans peur et sans reproche * as he styled
 58705	himselfâwho was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys demanding
 58706	their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was ordered to do.
 58707	
 58708	    * Knight without fear and without reproach.
 58709	
 58710	âI give you that column, lads,â he said, riding up to the troops and
 58711	pointing out the French to the cavalry.
 58712	
 58713	And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could
 58714	scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented
 58715	to themâthat is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,
 58716	frost-bitten, and starvingâand the column that had been presented to
 58717	them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to
 58718	do.
 58719	
 58720	At KrÃ¡snoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several hundred
 58721	cannon, and a stick called a âmarshalâs staff,â and disputed as to who
 58722	had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievementâthough
 58723	they much regretted not having taken Napoleon, or at least a marshal or
 58724	a hero of some sort, and reproached one another and especially KutÃºzov
 58725	for having failed to do so.
 58726	
 58727	These men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the
 58728	most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and
 58729	imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable
 58730	deed. They blamed KutÃºzov and said that from the very beginning of the
 58731	campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought of
 58732	nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen
 58733	Factories because he was comfortable there, that at KrÃ¡snoe he checked
 58734	the advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite
 58735	lost his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding
 58736	with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.
 58737	
 58738	Not only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk
 58739	in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand,
 58740	while KutÃºzov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak
 58741	old courtier, and by Russians as something indefiniteâa sort of puppet
 58742	useful only because he had a Russian name.
 58743	
 58744	
 58745	
 58746	
 58747	
 58748	CHAPTER V
 58749	
 58750	In 1812 and 1813 KutÃºzov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor
 58751	was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by order
 58752	of the Highest Authorities it is said that KutÃºzov was a cunning court
 58753	liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at
 58754	KrÃ¡snoe and the BerÃ«zina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of
 58755	complete victory over the French. *
 58756	
 58757	     * History of the year 1812. The character of KutÃºzov and
 58758	     reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at
 58759	     KrÃ¡snoe, by BogdÃ¡novich.
 58760	
 58761	Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind
 58762	does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals
 58763	who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their personal will to
 58764	it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning
 58765	the higher laws.
 58766	
 58767	For Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleonâthat most
 58768	insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed
 58769	human dignityâNapoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he
 58770	is grand. But KutÃºzovâthe man who from the beginning to the end of his
 58771	activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from BorodinÃ³ to
 58772	VÃ­lna, presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice
 58773	and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was
 58774	happeningâKutÃºzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful, and
 58775	when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little
 58776	ashamed.
 58777	
 58778	And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose
 58779	activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be
 58780	difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the
 58781	will of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find
 58782	an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so
 58783	completely accomplished as that to which all KutÃºzovâs efforts were
 58784	directed in 1812.
 58785	
 58786	KutÃºzov never talked of âforty centuries looking down from the
 58787	Pyramids,â of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of
 58788	what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he
 58789	said nothing about himself, adopted no pose, always appeared to be
 58790	the simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most
 58791	ordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de
 58792	StaÃ«l, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with
 58793	generals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who tried
 58794	to prove anything to him. When Count RostopchÃ­n at the YaÃºza bridge
 58795	galloped up to KutÃºzov with personal reproaches for having caused the
 58796	destruction of Moscow, and said: âHow was it you promised not to abandon
 58797	Moscow without a battle?â KutÃºzov replied: âAnd I shall not abandon
 58798	Moscow without a battle,â though Moscow was then already abandoned. When
 58799	ArakchÃ©ev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that ErmÃ³lov ought to
 58800	be appointed chief of the artillery, KutÃºzov replied: âYes, I was
 58801	just saying so myself,â though a moment before he had said quite the
 58802	contrary. What did it matter to himâwho then alone amid a senseless
 58803	crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was
 58804	happeningâwhat did it matter to him whether RostopchÃ­n attributed the
 58805	calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to
 58806	him who was appointed chief of the artillery.
 58807	
 58808	Not merely in these cases but continually did that old manâwho by
 58809	experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the
 58810	words serving as their expression are not what move peopleâuse quite
 58811	meaningless words that happened to enter his head.
 58812	
 58813	But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole
 58814	time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim
 58815	toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of
 58816	himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real
 58817	thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood.
 58818	Beginning with the battle of BorodinÃ³, from which time his disagreement
 58819	with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of BorodinÃ³
 58820	was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches
 58821	and reports up to the time of his death. He alone said that the loss of
 58822	Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to Lauristonâs proposal of
 58823	peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the peopleâs will. He
 58824	alone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are
 58825	useless, everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could
 58826	desire; that the enemy must be offered âa golden bridgeâ; that neither
 58827	the TarÃºtino, the VyÃ¡zma, nor the KrÃ¡snoe battles were necessary; that
 58828	we must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that he would
 58829	not sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.
 58830	
 58831	And this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to ArakchÃ©ev
 58832	to please the Emperor, he aloneâincurring thereby the Emperorâs
 58833	displeasureâsaid in VÃ­lna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is
 58834	useless and harmful.
 58835	
 58836	Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the
 58837	events. His actionsâwithout the smallest deviationâwere all directed
 58838	to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for
 58839	conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out
 58840	of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people
 58841	and of our army.
 58842	
 58843	This procrastinator KutÃºzov, whose motto was âPatience and Time,â
 58844	this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at BorodinÃ³, investing the
 58845	preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This KutÃºzov who before
 58846	the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in
 58847	contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that BorodinÃ³
 58848	was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was
 58849	lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after
 58850	winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat
 58851	insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought,
 58852	and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia
 58853	crossed.
 58854	
 58855	It is easy now to understand the significance of these eventsâif only we
 58856	abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed
 58857	only in the heads of a dozen individualsâfor the events and results now
 58858	lie before us.
 58859	
 58860	But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion,
 58861	so truly discern the importance of the peopleâs view of the events that
 58862	in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?
 58863	
 58864	The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the
 58865	events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in
 58866	full purity and strength.
 58867	
 58868	Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused
 58869	the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsarâs wish, to
 58870	select himâan old man in disfavorâto be their representative in the
 58871	national war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest human
 58872	pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers
 58873	not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on
 58874	them.
 58875	
 58876	That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be
 58877	cast in the false mold of a European heroâthe supposed ruler of menâthat
 58878	history has invented.
 58879	
 58880	To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of
 58881	greatness.
 58882

 58887	CHAPTER VI
 58888	
 58889	The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of
 58890	KrÃ¡snoe. Toward eveningâafter much disputing and many mistakes made by
 58891	generals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had
 58892	been sent about with counterordersâwhen it had become plain that the
 58893	enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no
 58894	battle, KutÃºzov left KrÃ¡snoe and went to DÃ³broe whither his headquarters
 58895	had that day been transferred.
 58896	
 58897	The day was clear and frosty. KutÃºzov rode to DÃ³broe on his plump little
 58898	white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who
 58899	whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the road groups of
 58900	French prisoners captured that day (there were seven thousand of them)
 58901	were crowding to warm themselves at campfires. Near DÃ³broe an immense
 58902	crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged
 58903	in anything they had been able to get hold of, were standing in the road
 58904	beside a long row of unharnessed French guns. At the approach of the
 58905	commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on
 58906	KutÃºzov who, wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat
 58907	that bulged on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his
 58908	white horse. One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and
 58909	prisoners had been captured.
 58910	
 58911	KutÃºzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was
 58912	saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed
 58913	attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially
 58914	wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses
 58915	and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and festering eyes.
 58916	
 58917	One group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them, one of
 58918	whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of raw
 58919	flesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial in
 58920	the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent
 58921	expression with which, after a glance at KutÃºzov, the soldier with the
 58922	sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing.
 58923	
 58924	KutÃºzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He puckered his
 58925	face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another
 58926	spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the
 58927	shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and KutÃºzov with
 58928	the same expression on his face again swayed his head.
 58929	
 58930	âWhat were you saying?â he asked the general, who continuing his report
 58931	directed the commander in chiefâs attention to some standards captured
 58932	from the French and standing in front of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment.
 58933	
 58934	âAh, the standards!â said KutÃºzov, evidently detaching himself with
 58935	difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.
 58936	
 58937	He looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at him from
 58938	all sides awaiting a word from him.
 58939	
 58940	He stopped in front of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment, sighed deeply, and
 58941	closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying
 58942	the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them.
 58943	KutÃºzov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident
 58944	reluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head
 58945	and began to speak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He looked
 58946	attentively around at the circle of officers, recognizing several of
 58947	them.
 58948	
 58949	âI thank you all!â he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the
 58950	officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were
 58951	distinctly heard. âI thank you all for your hard and faithful service.
 58952	The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you
 58953	forever.â
 58954	
 58955	He paused and looked around.
 58956	
 58957	âLower its head, lower it!â he said to a soldier who had accidentally
 58958	lowered the French eagle he was holding before the PreobrazhÃ©nsk
 58959	standards. âLower, lower, thatâs it. Hurrah lads!â he added, addressing
 58960	the men with a rapid movement of his chin.
 58961	
 58962	âHur-r-rah!â roared thousands of voices.
 58963	
 58964	While the soldiers were shouting KutÃºzov leaned forward in his saddle
 58965	and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic
 58966	gleam.
 58967	
 58968	âYou see, brothers...â said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at
 58969	once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no longer
 58970	the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to
 58971	tell his comrades something very important.
 58972	
 58973	There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the
 58974	soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was going to
 58975	say.
 58976	
 58977	âYou see, brothers, I know itâs hard for you, but it canât be helped!
 58978	Bear up; it wonât be for long now! Weâll see our visitors off and then
 58979	weâll rest. The Tsar wonât forget your service. It is hard for you, but
 58980	still you are at home while theyâyou see what they have come to,â said
 58981	he, pointing to the prisoners. âWorse off than our poorest beggars.
 58982	While they were strong we didnât spare ourselves, but now we may even
 58983	pity them. They are human beings too. Isnât it so, lads?â
 58984	
 58985	He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed
 58986	upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew brighter
 58987	and brighter with an old manâs mild smile, which drew the corners of his
 58988	lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed
 58989	his head as if in perplexity.
 58990	
 58991	âBut after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody
 58992	bastards!â he cried, suddenly lifting his head.
 58993	
 58994	And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time
 58995	during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the soldiers
 58996	laughing joyfully and shouting âHurrah!â
 58997	
 58998	KutÃºzovâs words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could have
 58999	repeated the field marshalâs address, begun solemnly and then changing
 59000	into an old manâs simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that
 59001	speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe
 59002	and consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that
 59003	old manâs good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay
 59004	in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and
 59005	long-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one of the generals addressed
 59006	KutÃºzov asking whether he wished his calÃ¨che to be sent for, KutÃºzov in
 59007	answering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved.
 59008	
 59009	
 59010	
 59011	
 59012	
 59013	CHAPTER VII
 59014	
 59015	When the troops reached their nightâs halting place on the eighth of
 59016	November, the last day of the KrÃ¡snoe battles, it was already growing
 59017	dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly
 59018	falling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the falling
 59019	snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew
 59020	keener.
 59021	
 59022	An infantry regiment which had left TarÃºtino three thousand strong but
 59023	now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night
 59024	at its halting placeâa village on the highroad. The quartermasters who
 59025	met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead
 59026	Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff. There was only one hut
 59027	available for the regimental commander.
 59028	
 59029	The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the
 59030	village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.
 59031	
 59032	Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its
 59033	lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep
 59034	through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and
 59035	immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches,
 59036	and merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the
 59037	regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy
 59038	getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third
 59039	section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff
 59040	officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and
 59041	dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the
 59042	campfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter.
 59043	
 59044	Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle
 59045	wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.
 59046	
 59047	âNow then, all togetherâshove!â cried the voices, and the huge surface
 59048	of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen
 59049	swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked more and
 59050	more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had been pushing
 59051	it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.
 59052	
 59053	âNow then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! Thatâs it.... Where
 59054	are you shoving to?â
 59055	
 59056	âNow, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!â
 59057	
 59058	All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to sing. At
 59059	the end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty voices
 59060	roared out at once: âOo-oo-oo-oo! Thatâs it. All together! Heave away,
 59061	boys!...â but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved, and
 59062	in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible.
 59063	
 59064	âHere, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand...
 59065	will you? You may want us one of these days.â
 59066	
 59067	Some twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into the
 59068	village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about
 59069	thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the
 59070	village street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the
 59071	gasping men.
 59072	
 59073	âGet along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....â
 59074	
 59075	Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.
 59076	
 59077	âWhat are you up to?â suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
 59078	sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.
 59079	âThere are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you
 59080	foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, Iâll give it to you!â shouted he,
 59081	hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back.
 59082	âCanât you make less noise?â
 59083	
 59084	The men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped
 59085	his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against
 59086	the wattle.
 59087	
 59088	âThere, how that devil hits out! Heâs made my face all bloody,â said he
 59089	in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.
 59090	
 59091	âDonât you like it?â said a laughing voice, and moderating their tones
 59092	the men moved forward.
 59093	
 59094	When they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as
 59095	before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.
 59096	
 59097	In the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered and
 59098	were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the
 59099	maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a flank march
 59100	to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture him.
 59101	
 59102	By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place
 59103	the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood
 59104	crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers flitted
 59105	to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden
 59106	down.
 59107	
 59108	Axes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without any
 59109	orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night, shelters
 59110	were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being boiled, and muskets
 59111	and accouterments put in order.
 59112	
 59113	The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the
 59114	Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests,
 59115	and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo, called the
 59116	roll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for the nightâsome
 59117	repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some stripping
 59118	themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.
 59119	
 59120	
 59121	
 59122	
 59123	
 59124	CHAPTER VIII
 59125	
 59126	One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched
 59127	conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that timeâlacking warm boots
 59128	and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the snow
 59129	with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations (the
 59130	commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)âthey would have
 59131	presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.
 59132	
 59133	On the contrary, the army had never under the best material conditions
 59134	presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was because all who
 59135	began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army
 59136	day by day. All the physically or morally weak had long since been left
 59137	behind and only the flower of the armyâphysically and mentallyâremained.
 59138	
 59139	More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than
 59140	anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their
 59141	campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by their wattle
 59142	they demanded contributions of fuel.
 59143	
 59144	âEh, MakÃ©ev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you lost or
 59145	have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!â shouted a red-haired
 59146	and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the
 59147	smoke but not moving back from the fire. âAnd you, Jackdaw, go and fetch
 59148	some wood!â said he to another soldier.
 59149	
 59150	This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being
 59151	robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier
 59152	they called âJackdaw,â a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose
 59153	obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into
 59154	the light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier
 59155	carrying a load of wood.
 59156	
 59157	âBring it hereâthatâs fine!â
 59158	
 59159	They split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with
 59160	their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, making
 59161	the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit their pipes.
 59162	The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood, setting his arms
 59163	akimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot
 59164	where he stood.
 59165	
 59166	âMother! The dew is cold but clear.... Itâs well that Iâm a
 59167	musketeer...â he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.
 59168	
 59169	âLook out, your soles will fly off!â shouted the red-haired man,
 59170	noticing that the sole of the dancerâs boot was hanging loose. âWhat a
 59171	fellow you are for dancing!â
 59172	
 59173	The dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw it
 59174	on the fire.
 59175	
 59176	âRight enough, friend,â said he, and, having sat down, took out of his
 59177	knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his foot.
 59178	âItâs the steam that spoils them,â he added, stretching out his feet
 59179	toward the fire.
 59180	
 59181	âTheyâll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when weâve finished
 59182	hammering them, weâre to receive double kits!â
 59183	
 59184	âAnd that son of a bitch PetrÃ³v has lagged behind after all, it seems,â
 59185	said one sergeant major.
 59186	
 59187	âIâve had an eye on him this long while,â said the other.
 59188	
 59189	âWell, heâs a poor sort of soldier....â
 59190	
 59191	âBut in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday.â
 59192	
 59193	âYes, itâs all very well, but when a manâs feet are frozen how can he
 59194	walk?â
 59195	
 59196	âEh? Donât talk nonsense!â said a sergeant major.
 59197	
 59198	âDo you want to be doing the same?â said an old soldier, turning
 59199	reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.
 59200	
 59201	âWell, you know,â said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a
 59202	squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the
 59203	fire, âa plump man gets thin, but for a thin one itâs death. Take
 59204	me, now! Iâve got no strength left,â he added, with sudden resolution
 59205	turning to the sergeant major. âTell them to send me to hospital; Iâm
 59206	aching all over; anyway I shanât be able to keep up.â
 59207	
 59208	âThatâll do, thatâll do!â replied the sergeant major quietly.
 59209	
 59210	The soldier said no more and the talk went on.
 59211	
 59212	âWhat a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is that
 59213	not one of them had what you might call real boots on,â said a soldier,
 59214	starting a new theme. âThey were no more than make-believes.â
 59215	
 59216	âThe Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for the
 59217	colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,â put in
 59218	the dancer. âAs they turned them over one seemed still alive and, would
 59219	you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo.â
 59220	
 59221	âBut theyâre a clean folk, lads,â the first man went on; âhe was
 59222	whiteâas white as birchbarkâand some of them are such fine fellows, you
 59223	might think they were nobles.â
 59224	
 59225	âWell, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there.â
 59226	
 59227	âBut they donât understand our talk at all,â said the dancer with a
 59228	puzzled smile. âI asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in his
 59229	own way. A queer lot!â
 59230	
 59231	âBut itâs strange, friends,â continued the man who had wondered at their
 59232	whiteness, âthe peasants at MozhÃ¡ysk were saying that when they began
 59233	burying the deadâwhere the battle was you knowâwell, those dead had been
 59234	lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, âthey lie as white
 59235	as paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.ââ
 59236	
 59237	âWas it from the cold?â asked someone.
 59238	
 59239	âYouâre a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it
 59240	had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. âBut,â he
 59241	says, âgo up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,â he says,
 59242	âwe tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag
 59243	them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,â he says, âare white as paper
 59244	and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.ââ
 59245	
 59246	All were silent.
 59247	
 59248	âIt must be from their food,â said the sergeant major. âThey used to
 59249	gobble the same food as the gentry.â
 59250	
 59251	No one contradicted him.
 59252	
 59253	âThat peasant near MozhÃ¡ysk where the battle was said the men were all
 59254	called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and
 59255	still didnât finish carting the dead away. And as for the wolves, he
 59256	says...â
 59257	
 59258	âThat was a real battle,â said an old soldier. âItâs the only one worth
 59259	remembering; but since that... itâs only been tormenting folk.â
 59260	
 59261	âAnd do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and,
 59262	my word, they didnât let us get near before they just threw down their
 59263	muskets and went on their knees. âPardon!â they say. Thatâs only one
 59264	case. They say PlÃ¡tov took âPoleon himself twice. But he didnât know
 59265	the right charm. He catches him and catches himâno good! He turns into
 59266	a bird in his hands and flies away. And thereâs no way of killing him
 59267	either.â
 59268	
 59269	âYouâre a first-class liar, KiselÃ«v, when I come to look at you!â
 59270	
 59271	âLiar, indeed! Itâs the real truth.â
 59272	
 59273	âIf he fell into my hands, when Iâd caught him Iâd bury him in the
 59274	ground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men heâs
 59275	ruined!â
 59276	
 59277	âWell, anyhow weâre going to end it. He wonât come here again,â remarked
 59278	the old soldier, yawning.
 59279	
 59280	The conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to sleep.
 59281	
 59282	âLook at the stars. Itâs wonderful how they shine! You would think the
 59283	women had spread out their linen,â said one of the men, gazing with
 59284	admiration at the Milky Way.
 59285	
 59286	âThatâs a sign of a good harvest next year.â
 59287	
 59288	âWe shall want some more wood.â
 59289	
 59290	âYou warm your back and your belly gets frozen. Thatâs queer.â
 59291	
 59292	âO Lord!â
 59293	
 59294	âWhat are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how heâs
 59295	sprawling!â
 59296	
 59297	In the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen asleep
 59298	could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now and again
 59299	exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound
 59300	of general, merry laughter.
 59301	
 59302	âHark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!â said one of the
 59303	soldiers, âand what a lot of them there are!â
 59304	
 59305	One of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.
 59306	
 59307	âTheyâre having such fun,â said he, coming back. âTwo Frenchies have
 59308	turned up. Oneâs quite frozen and the otherâs an awful swaggerer. Heâs
 59309	singing songs....â
 59310	
 59311	âOh, Iâll go across and have a look....â
 59312	
 59313	And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.
 59314	
 59315	
 59316	
 59317	
 59318	
 59319	CHAPTER IX
 59320	
 59321	The Fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest. A huge
 59322	campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the
 59323	branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.
 59324	
 59325	About midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest,
 59326	and the crackling of dry branches.
 59327	
 59328	âA bear, lads,â said one of the men.
 59329	
 59330	They all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into the
 59331	bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to
 59332	one another.
 59333	
 59334	These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They came up
 59335	to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did
 59336	not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officerâs hat
 59337	and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to
 59338	sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl
 59339	tied round his head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said
 59340	something, pointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen,
 59341	spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some
 59342	buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them.
 59343	
 59344	The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head
 59345	wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.
 59346	
 59347	When Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he
 59348	suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the
 59349	soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and
 59350	resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at
 59351	the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted
 59352	a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel, pointing to his
 59353	shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was
 59354	an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer who had come up
 59355	to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French
 59356	officer into his hut to warm him, and when the messenger returned and
 59357	said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him, Ramballe
 59358	was told to go. He rose and tried to walk, but staggered and would have
 59359	fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up.
 59360	
 59361	âYou wonât do it again, eh?â said one of the soldiers, winking and
 59362	turning mockingly to Ramballe.
 59363	
 59364	âOh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you areâa real peasant!â came
 59365	rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.
 59366	
 59367	They surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two
 59368	soldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around their
 59369	necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:
 59370	
 59371	âOh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh, my
 59372	brave, kind friends,â and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one
 59373	of the men like a child.
 59374	
 59375	Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by
 59376	the soldiers.
 59377	
 59378	Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes, was
 59379	wearing a womanâs cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his
 59380	head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a French song
 59381	in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier.
 59382	The soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him.
 59383	
 59384	âNow then, now then, teach us how it goes! Iâll soon pick it up. How is
 59385	it?â said the manâa singer and a wagâwhom Morel was embracing.
 59386	
 59387	âVive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!â sang Morel, winking. âCe
 59388	diable Ã  quatre...â *
 59389	
 59390	     * âLong live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy
 59391	     devil.â
 59392	
 59393	
 59394	âVivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!â repeated the soldier, flourishing
 59395	his arm and really catching the tune.
 59396	
 59397	âBravo! Ha, ha, ha!â rose their rough, joyous laughter from all sides.
 59398	
 59399	Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.
 59400	
 59401	âWell, go on, go on!â
 59402	
 59403	    âQui eut le triple talent,
 59404	    De boire, de battre,
 59405	    Et dâÃªtre un vert galant.â *
 59406	
 59407	      * Who had a triple talent
 59408	      For drinking, for fighting,
 59409	      And for being a gallant old boy...
 59410	
 59411	âIt goes smoothly, too. Well, now, ZaletÃ¡ev!â
 59412	
 59413	âKe...â ZaletÃ¡ev, brought out with effort: âke-e-e-e,â he drawled,
 59414	laboriously pursing his lips, âle-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e
 59415	de-tra-va-ga-laâ he sang.
 59416	
 59417	âFine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?â
 59418	
 59419	âGive him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after
 59420	starving.â
 59421	
 59422	They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on
 59423	his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.
 59424	The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such
 59425	nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one
 59426	would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a
 59427	smile.
 59428	
 59429	âThey are men too,â said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his
 59430	coat. âEven wormwood grows on its own root.â
 59431	
 59432	âO Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard
 59433	frost....â
 59434	
 59435	They all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking
 59436	at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring
 59437	up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something
 59438	gladsome and mysterious to one another.
 59439	
 59440	
 59441	
 59442	
 59443	
 59444	CHAPTER X
 59445	
 59446	The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical
 59447	progression; and that crossing of the BerÃ«zina about which so much has
 59448	been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and
 59449	not at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been
 59450	and still is written about the BerÃ«zina, on the French side this is only
 59451	because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army
 59452	had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment
 59453	into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the
 59454	Russian side merely because in Petersburgâfar from the seat of warâa
 59455	plan (again one of Pfuelâs) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a
 59456	strategic trap at the BerÃ«zina River. Everyone assured himself that all
 59457	would happen according to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just
 59458	the crossing of the BerÃ«zina that destroyed the French army. In reality
 59459	the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the Frenchâin
 59460	guns and men lostâthan KrÃ¡snoe had been, as the figures show.
 59461	
 59462	The sole importance of the crossing of the BerÃ«zina lies in the fact
 59463	that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for
 59464	cutting off the enemyâs retreat and the soundness of the only possible
 59465	line of actionâthe one KutÃºzov and the general mass of the army
 59466	demandedânamely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled
 59467	at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to
 59468	reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible
 59469	to block its path. This was shown not so much by the arrangements it
 59470	made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridges
 59471	broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with
 59472	children who were with the French transport, allâcarried on by vis
 59473	inertiÃ¦âpressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and
 59474	did not surrender.
 59475	
 59476	That impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of pursuers
 59477	was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own people each
 59478	might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held
 59479	among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same
 59480	pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the
 59481	necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fact
 59482	that half the prisonersâwith whom the Russians did not know what to
 59483	doâperished of cold and hunger despite their captorsâ desire to save
 59484	them; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The most compassionate
 59485	Russian commanders, those favorable to the Frenchâand even the Frenchmen
 59486	in the Russian serviceâcould do nothing for the prisoners. The French
 59487	perished from the conditions to which the Russian army was itself
 59488	exposed. It was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and
 59489	indispensable soldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful, or
 59490	hated, or guilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that,
 59491	but they were exceptions.
 59492	
 59493	Certain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope.
 59494	Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective
 59495	flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.
 59496	
 59497	The farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the
 59498	remnant, especially after the BerÃ«zina, on which (in consequence of the
 59499	Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and
 59500	the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed one
 59501	another and KutÃºzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of
 59502	the Petersburg BerÃ«zina plan would be attributed to KutÃºzov led
 59503	to dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly
 59504	expressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a
 59505	respectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was
 59506	to blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or
 59507	asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable
 59508	formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at
 59509	every turn.
 59510	
 59511	Because they could not understand him all these people assumed that
 59512	it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the
 59513	profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which
 59514	they thought were mere phrases) about a âgolden bridge,â about the
 59515	impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions,
 59516	and so forth. They had heard all that before. And all he saidâthat it
 59517	was necessary to await provisions, or that the men had no bootsâwas so
 59518	simple, while what they proposed was so complicated and clever, that
 59519	it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though not in
 59520	power, were commanders of genius.
 59521	
 59522	After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg
 59523	hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their
 59524	maximum. KutÃºzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.
 59525	Only once, after the affair of the BerÃ«zina, did he get angry and write
 59526	to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following
 59527	letter:
 59528	
 59529	âOn account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please
 59530	be so good as to set off for KalÃºga on receipt of this, and there await
 59531	further commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty.â
 59532	
 59533	But after Bennigsenâs departure, the Grand Duke TsarÃ©vich Constantine
 59534	PÃ¡vlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the beginning of the
 59535	campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by KutÃºzov.
 59536	Now having come to the army, he informed KutÃºzov of the Emperorâs
 59537	displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their
 59538	advance. The Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few daysâ
 59539	time.
 59540	
 59541	The old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairsâthis
 59542	same KutÃºzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief
 59543	against the sovereignâs wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and
 59544	heir-apparent from the armyâwho on his own authority and contrary to the
 59545	Emperorâs will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now realized at
 59546	once that his day was over, that his part was played, and that the power
 59547	he was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he understood this not
 59548	merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the
 59549	military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt
 59550	that his mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to
 59551	be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the
 59552	necessity of physical rest.
 59553	
 59554	On the twenty-ninth of November KutÃºzov entered VÃ­lnaâhis âdear VÃ­lnaâ
 59555	as he called it. Twice during his career KutÃºzov had been governor of
 59556	VÃ­lna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old
 59557	friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had
 59558	so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army
 59559	and state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,
 59560	immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been
 59561	accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be
 59562	done in the realm of history did not concern him at all.
 59563	
 59564	ChichagÃ³v, one of the most zealous âcutters-offâ and âbreakers-up,â who
 59565	had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but
 59566	never wished to go where he was sent: ChichagÃ³v, noted for the boldness
 59567	with which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered KutÃºzov to be
 59568	under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace
 59569	with Turkey in 1811 independently of KutÃºzov, and found that peace had
 59570	already been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of
 59571	securing that peace was really KutÃºzovâs; this ChichagÃ³v was the first
 59572	to meet KutÃºzov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress
 59573	naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he handed
 59574	KutÃºzov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The contemptuously
 59575	respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was
 59576	expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of ChichagÃ³v, who knew
 59577	of the accusations that were being directed against KutÃºzov.
 59578	
 59579	When speaking to ChichagÃ³v, KutÃºzov incidentally mentioned that the
 59580	vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at BorÃ­sov
 59581	had been recovered and would be restored to him.
 59582	
 59583	âYou mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the
 59584	contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give
 59585	dinner parties,â warmly replied ChichagÃ³v, who tried by every word he
 59586	spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined KutÃºzov to be
 59587	animated by the same desire.
 59588	
 59589	KutÃºzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating
 59590	smile: âI meant merely to say what I said.â
 59591	
 59592	Contrary to the Emperorâs wish KutÃºzov detained the greater part of the
 59593	army at VÃ­lna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack
 59594	and physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army
 59595	affairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting
 59596	the Emperorâs arrival led a dissipated life.
 59597	
 59598	Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suiteâCount
 59599	TolstÃ³y, Prince VolkÃ³nski, ArakchÃ©ev, and othersâthe Emperor reached
 59600	VÃ­lna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to
 59601	the castle. In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff
 59602	officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle, as well as
 59603	a guard of honor of the SemÃ«nov regiment.
 59604	
 59605	A courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with three
 59606	foam-flecked horses, shouted âComing!â and KonovnÃ­tsyn rushed into the
 59607	vestibule to inform KutÃºzov, who was waiting in the hall porterâs little
 59608	lodge.
 59609	
 59610	A minute later the old manâs large stout figure in full-dress uniform,
 59611	his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach,
 59612	waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its peaks to the
 59613	sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort
 59614	sideways down the steps to the level of the street, took in his hand the
 59615	report he had prepared for the Emperor.
 59616	
 59617	There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew
 59618	furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh
 59619	in which the figures of the Emperor and VolkÃ³nski could already be
 59620	descried.
 59621	
 59622	From the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect
 59623	on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over,
 59624	readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and,
 59625	at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh,
 59626	lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his
 59627	smooth, ingratiating voice.
 59628	
 59629	The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned KutÃºzov from head to foot,
 59630	frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the
 59631	old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too, owing
 59632	to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings, had its
 59633	usual effect on KutÃºzov and he gave a sob.
 59634	
 59635	The Emperor greeted the officers and the SemÃ«nov guard, and again
 59636	pressing the old manâs hand went with him into the castle.
 59637	
 59638	When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his
 59639	dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made
 59640	at KrÃ¡snoe and the BerÃ«zina, and informed him of his intentions for a
 59641	future campaign abroad. KutÃºzov made no rejoinder or remark. The same
 59642	submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the
 59643	Emperorâs commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled
 59644	on his face now.
 59645	
 59646	When KutÃºzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing
 59647	the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someoneâs
 59648	voice saying:
 59649	
 59650	âYour Serene Highness!â
 59651	
 59652	KutÃºzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of
 59653	Count TolstÃ³y, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay
 59654	a small object. KutÃºzov seemed not to understand what was expected of
 59655	him.
 59656	
 59657	Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed
 59658	across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the
 59659	object that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the
 59660	First Class.
 59661	
 59662	
 59663	
 59664	
 59665	
 59666	CHAPTER XI
 59667	
 59668	Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor
 59669	honored by his presence. KutÃºzov had received the Order of St. George
 59670	of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors, but
 59671	everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties
 59672	were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example,
 59673	but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and
 59674	good-for-nothing. When KutÃºzov, conforming to a custom of Catherineâs
 59675	day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the
 59676	Emperorâs feet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face
 59677	and muttered something in which some people caught the words, âthe old
 59678	comedian.â
 59679	
 59680	The Emperorâs displeasure with KutÃºzov was specially increased at VÃ­lna
 59681	by the fact that KutÃºzov evidently could not or would not understand the
 59682	importance of the coming campaign.
 59683	
 59684	When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled
 59685	about him: âYou have not only saved Russia, you have saved Europe!â they
 59686	all understood that the war was not ended.
 59687	
 59688	KutÃºzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that
 59689	no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia,
 59690	but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had
 59691	gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying
 59692	fresh troops, spoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of
 59693	the possibility of failure and so forth.
 59694	
 59695	This being the field marshalâs frame of mind he was naturally regarded
 59696	as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.
 59697	
 59698	To avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural method was
 59699	to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at
 59700	the beginning of the Russian campaignâto transfer the authority to the
 59701	Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the commander in
 59702	chiefâs feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the
 59703	change.
 59704	
 59705	With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real
 59706	strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, KonovnÃ­tsyn, and
 59707	ErmÃ³lov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field
 59708	marshalâs great weakness and failing health.
 59709	
 59710	His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to
 59711	another. And in fact his health was poor.
 59712	
 59713	So naturally, simply, and graduallyâjust as he had come from Turkey to
 59714	the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to the army
 59715	when he was needed thereânow when his part was played out, KutÃºzovâs
 59716	place was taken by a new and necessary performer.
 59717	
 59718	The war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every Russian
 59719	heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.
 59720	
 59721	The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a
 59722	movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another
 59723	leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from
 59724	KutÃºzovâs and animated by different motives.
 59725	
 59726	Alexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east
 59727	to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as KutÃºzov had been
 59728	for the salvation and glory of Russia.
 59729	
 59730	KutÃºzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or
 59731	Napoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of
 59732	the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had
 59733	been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing
 59734	left to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of the
 59735	national war but to die, and KutÃºzov died.
 59736	
 59737	
 59738	
 59739	
 59740	
 59741	CHAPTER XII
 59742	
 59743	As generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the
 59744	physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after
 59745	they were over. After his liberation he reached OrÃ«l, and on the third
 59746	day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up
 59747	for three months. He had what the doctors termed âbilious fever.â But
 59748	despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him
 59749	medicines to drink, he recovered.
 59750	
 59751	Scarcely any impression was left on Pierreâs mind by all that happened
 59752	to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered
 59753	only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical
 59754	distress, and pains in his feet and side. He remembered a general
 59755	impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being
 59756	worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him, he
 59757	also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses, and
 59758	above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time.
 59759	On the day of his rescue he had seen the body of PÃ©tya RostÃ³v. That same
 59760	day he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of
 59761	BorodinÃ³ for more than a month had recently died in the RostÃ³vsâ house
 59762	at YaroslÃ¡vl, and DenÃ­sov who told him this news also mentioned HÃ©lÃ¨neâs
 59763	death, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at
 59764	the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its
 59765	significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as
 59766	possible from places where people were killing one another, to some
 59767	peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over
 59768	all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching OrÃ«l he
 59769	immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw
 59770	in attendance on him two of his servants, TerÃ©nty and VÃ¡ska, who had
 59771	come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been
 59772	living on his estate at ElÃ©ts and hearing of his rescue and illness had
 59773	come to look after him.
 59774	
 59775	It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the
 59776	impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months
 59777	and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere
 59778	tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he
 59779	would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in
 59780	his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the
 59781	same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been
 59782	told after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of
 59783	his wife, and the destruction of the French.
 59784	
 59785	A joyous feeling of freedomâthat complete inalienable freedom natural
 59786	to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside
 59787	Moscowâfilled Pierreâs soul during his convalescence. He was surprised
 59788	to find that this inner freedom, which was independent of external
 59789	conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of external
 59790	liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances. No one
 59791	demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere. He had all he wanted:
 59792	the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no
 59793	longer there, since she was no more.
 59794	
 59795	âOh, how good! How splendid!â said he to himself when a cleanly laid
 59796	table was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down for
 59797	the night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the French had
 59798	gone and that his wife was no more. âOh, how good, how splendid!â
 59799	
 59800	And by old habit he asked himself the question: âWell, and what then?
 59801	What am I going to do?â And he immediately gave himself the answer:
 59802	âWell, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!â
 59803	
 59804	The very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he had
 59805	continually sought to findâthe aim of lifeâno longer existed for
 59806	him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared
 59807	temporarilyâhe felt that it no longer existed for him and could not
 59808	present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the
 59809	complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at
 59810	this time.
 59811	
 59812	He could not see an aim, for he now had faithânot faith in any kind of
 59813	rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever-manifest
 59814	God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for
 59815	an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity
 59816	he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his
 59817	nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere. In his
 59818	captivity he had learned that in KaratÃ¡ev God was greater, more infinite
 59819	and unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the
 59820	Freemasons. He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into
 59821	the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet. All his life
 59822	he had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should have
 59823	merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.
 59824	
 59825	In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable
 59826	infinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and
 59827	had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had seen
 59828	only what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had
 59829	equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space,
 59830	where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to
 59831	him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen. And such
 59832	had European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and philanthropy
 59833	seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted
 59834	them, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen
 59835	the same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, however, he
 59836	had learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and
 59837	thereforeâto see it and enjoy its contemplationâhe naturally threw away
 59838	the telescope through which he had till now gazed over menâs heads, and
 59839	gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and
 59840	infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and
 59841	happy he became. That dreadful question, âWhat for?â which had formerly
 59842	destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that
 59843	question, âWhat for?â a simple answer was now always ready in his soul:
 59844	âBecause there is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls
 59845	from a manâs head.â
 59846	
 59847	
 59848	
 59849	
 59850	
 59851	CHAPTER XIII
 59852	
 59853	In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he
 59854	was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed
 59855	occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special
 59856	of his own. The difference between his former and present self was that
 59857	formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to
 59858	him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to
 59859	distinguish something at a distance. At present he still forgot what was
 59860	said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes, but he now
 59861	looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what
 59862	was before him and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing
 59863	and hearing something quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be
 59864	a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid
 59865	him. Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and
 59866	sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to
 59867	whether they were as contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his
 59868	presence.
 59869	
 59870	Previously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and
 59871	seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and
 59872	knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate
 59873	secrets.
 59874	
 59875	The princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly
 59876	hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after
 59877	the old countâs death, now after staying a short time in OrÃ«lâwhere she
 59878	had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she
 59879	considered it her duty to nurse himâfelt to her surprise and vexation
 59880	that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her
 59881	approval, he merely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt
 59882	that he regarded her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into
 59883	herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side
 59884	of her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most
 59885	intimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards
 59886	gratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.
 59887	
 59888	The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more
 59889	successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and
 59890	showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierreâs cunning consisted simply in
 59891	finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,
 59892	hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.
 59893	
 59894	âYes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of
 59895	bad people but of people such as myself,â thought she.
 59896	
 59897	His servants tooâTerÃ©nty and VÃ¡skaâin their own way noticed the change
 59898	that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had become much
 59899	âsimpler.â TerÃ©nty, when he had helped him undress and wished him good
 59900	night, often lingered with his masterâs boots in his hands and clothes
 59901	over his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. And Pierre,
 59902	noticing that TerÃ©nty wanted a chat, generally kept him there.
 59903	
 59904	âWell, tell me... now, how did you get food?â he would ask.
 59905	
 59906	And TerÃ©nty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of
 59907	the old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and
 59908	talking, or sometimes listening to Pierreâs stories, and then would go
 59909	out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and
 59910	affection for him.
 59911	
 59912	The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he
 59913	considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment
 59914	was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre
 59915	telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the
 59916	characters of his patients in general, and especially of the ladies.
 59917	
 59918	âItâs a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our
 59919	provincials,â he would say.
 59920	
 59921	There were several prisoners from the French army in OrÃ«l, and the
 59922	doctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.
 59923	
 59924	This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of
 59925	the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.
 59926	
 59927	The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk
 59928	with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love,
 59929	and pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially
 59930	against Napoleon.
 59931	
 59932	âIf all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight
 59933	such a nation,â he said to Pierre. âYou, who have suffered so from the
 59934	French, do not even feel animosity toward them.â
 59935	
 59936	Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by
 59937	evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.
 59938	
 59939	During the last days of Pierreâs stay in OrÃ«l his old Masonic
 59940	acquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in
 59941	1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who
 59942	had a large estate in OrÃ«l province, and he occupied a temporary post in
 59943	the commissariat department in that town.
 59944	
 59945	Hearing that BezÃºkhov was in OrÃ«l, Willarski, though they had never been
 59946	intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy
 59947	that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.
 59948	Willarski felt dull in OrÃ«l and was pleased to meet a man of his own
 59949	circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.
 59950	
 59951	But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much
 59952	behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into
 59953	apathy and egotism.
 59954	
 59955	âYou are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,â he said.
 59956	
 59957	But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been
 59958	formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as
 59959	he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that
 59960	he had been like that himself but a short time before.
 59961	
 59962	Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,
 59963	his wifeâs affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these
 59964	occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all
 59965	contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his
 59966	family. Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests
 59967	continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre, without trying to
 59968	change the otherâs views and without condemning him, but with the quiet,
 59969	joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this
 59970	strange though very familiar phenomenon.
 59971	
 59972	There was a new feature in Pierreâs relations with Willarski, with the
 59973	princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which
 59974	gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of
 59975	the impossibility of changing a manâs convictions by words, and his
 59976	recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing
 59977	things each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of
 59978	each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a
 59979	basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other
 59980	people. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between
 59981	menâs opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased
 59982	him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.
 59983	
 59984	In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center
 59985	of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions,
 59986	especially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man,
 59987	he was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and
 59988	perplexity. âTo give or not to give?â he had asked himself. âI have
 59989	it and he needs it. But someone else needs it still more. Who needs it
 59990	most? And perhaps they are both impostors?â In the old days he had been
 59991	unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all
 59992	who asked as long as he had anything to give. Formerly he had been in a
 59993	similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his
 59994	property, when one person advised one thing and another something else.
 59995	
 59996	Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or
 59997	perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a judge who
 59998	by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.
 59999	
 60000	He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt
 60001	certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first time he
 60002	had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel,
 60003	came to him and, after talking a great deal about his exploits,
 60004	concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give
 60005	him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children. Pierre
 60006	refused without the least difficulty or effort, and was afterwards
 60007	surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so
 60008	insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused the colonelâs
 60009	demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when
 60010	leaving OrÃ«l, to induce the Italian officer to accept some money of
 60011	which he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own
 60012	more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision
 60013	with regard to his wifeâs debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in
 60014	and near Moscow.
 60015	
 60016	His head steward came to him at OrÃ«l and Pierre reckoned up with him his
 60017	diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the
 60018	head stewardâs calculation, about two million rubles.
 60019	
 60020	To console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate
 60021	showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but
 60022	would even be increased if he refused to pay his wifeâs debts which he
 60023	was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Moscow house
 60024	and the country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty
 60025	thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.
 60026	
 60027	âYes, of course thatâs true,â said Pierre with a cheerful smile. âI
 60028	donât need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much richer.â
 60029	
 60030	But in January SavÃ©lich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the
 60031	state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made
 60032	of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this
 60033	as of a settled matter. About the same time he received letters from
 60034	Prince VasÃ­li and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wifeâs
 60035	debts. And Pierre decided that the stewardâs proposals which had so
 60036	pleased him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his
 60037	wifeâs affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he
 60038	did not know, but he knew for certain that it was necessary. His income
 60039	would be reduced by three fourths, but he felt it must be done.
 60040	
 60041	Willarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.
 60042	
 60043	During the whole time of his convalescence in OrÃ«l Pierre had
 60044	experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his
 60045	journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
 60046	faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like
 60047	a schoolboy on holiday. Everyoneâthe stagecoach driver, the post-house
 60048	overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villagesâhad a new
 60049	significance for him. The presence and remarks of Willarski who
 60050	continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its
 60051	backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierreâs pleasure.
 60052	Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary strength and
 60053	vitalityâthe strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained
 60054	the life of this original, peculiar, and unique people. He did not
 60055	contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with himâan apparent
 60056	agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to
 60057	nothingâand he smiled joyfully as he listened to him.
 60058	
 60059	
 60060	
 60061	
 60062	
 60063	CHAPTER XIV
 60064	
 60065	It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap
 60066	has been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of
 60067	rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they
 60068	jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally
 60069	difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the
 60070	French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But when
 60071	we watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and
 60072	immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction
 60073	of the heap, something indestructible, which though intangible is the
 60074	real strength of the colony, still exists; and similarly, though in
 60075	Moscow in the month of October there was no government and no churches,
 60076	shrines, riches, or housesâit was still the Moscow it had been in
 60077	August. All was destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and
 60078	indestructible.
 60079	
 60080	The motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after it had
 60081	been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first
 60082	for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in
 60083	common: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to
 60084	apply their activities there.
 60085	
 60086	Within a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a
 60087	fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the
 60088	number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in
 60089	1812.
 60090	
 60091	The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerodeâs
 60092	detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents who had
 60093	fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who
 60094	entered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered it in their turn. They
 60095	continued what the French had begun. Trains of peasant carts came to
 60096	Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the
 60097	ruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried off what they could
 60098	to their camps, and the householders seized all they could find in other
 60099	houses and moved it to their own, pretending that it was their property.
 60100	
 60101	But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third
 60102	contingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more
 60103	difficult and assumed more definite forms.
 60104	
 60105	The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of
 60106	regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with
 60107	luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were
 60108	lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses,
 60109	market stalls, granariesâfor the most part still stocked with goodsâand
 60110	there were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses filled
 60111	with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices, churches, and
 60112	cathedrals. The longer the French remained the more these forms of town
 60113	life perished, until finally all was merged into one confused, lifeless
 60114	scene of plunder.
 60115	
 60116	The more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the
 60117	wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But
 60118	plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city
 60119	began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater
 60120	the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth
 60121	of the city and its regular life restored.
 60122	
 60123	Besides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by curiosity,
 60124	some by official duties, some by self-interestâhouse owners, clergy,
 60125	officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and peasantsâstreamed into
 60126	Moscow as blood flows to the heart.
 60127	
 60128	Within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off
 60129	plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses
 60130	out of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comradesâ
 60131	discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down
 60132	one anotherâs prices to below what they had been in former days. Gangs
 60133	of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and on
 60134	all sides logs were being hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ones
 60135	repaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns were
 60136	opened in partially burned houses. The clergy resumed the services
 60137	in many churches that had not been burned. Donors contributed
 60138	Church property that had been stolen. Government clerks set up their
 60139	baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms.
 60140	The higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of
 60141	goods left behind by the French. The owners of houses in which much
 60142	property had been left, brought there from other houses, complained of
 60143	the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the KrÃ©mlin;
 60144	others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different
 60145	houses into this or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to
 60146	keep all that was found there. They abused the police and bribed them,
 60147	made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that
 60148	had perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count RostopchÃ­n
 60149	wrote proclamations.
 60150	
 60151	
 60152	
 60153	
 60154	
 60155	CHAPTER XV
 60156	
 60157	At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of
 60158	his house which had not been burned. He called on Count RostopchÃ­n and
 60159	on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he intended to leave
 60160	for Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celebrating the victory,
 60161	everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city.
 60162	Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and
 60163	everyone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly
 60164	well disposed toward them all, but was now instinctively on his
 60165	guard for fear of binding himself in any way. To all questions put to
 60166	himâwhether important or quite triflingâsuch as: Where would he live?
 60167	Was he going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he
 60168	mind taking a parcel for someone?âhe replied: âYes, perhaps,â or, âI
 60169	think so,â and so on.
 60170	
 60171	He had heard that the RostÃ³vs were at KostromÃ¡ but the thought of
 60172	NatÃ¡sha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant
 60173	memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from social
 60174	obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had
 60175	aroused in himself.
 60176	
 60177	On the third day after his arrival he heard from the DrubetskÃ³ys that
 60178	Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of
 60179	Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierreâs thoughts and now recurred to
 60180	him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary
 60181	was in Moscow and living in her houseâwhich had not been burnedâin
 60182	VozdvÃ­zhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.
 60183	
 60184	On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their
 60185	friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last
 60186	one at BorodinÃ³.
 60187	
 60188	âIs it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?
 60189	Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him
 60190	before he died?â thought Pierre. He recalled KaratÃ¡ev and his death and
 60191	involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so
 60192	similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he
 60193	felt for both of them.
 60194	
 60195	Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood.
 60196	The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its
 60197	general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a
 60198	stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence
 60199	of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house,
 60200	informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments, and that
 60201	she received on Sundays.
 60202	
 60203	âAnnounce me. Perhaps she will see me,â said Pierre.
 60204	
 60205	âYes, sir,â said the man. âPlease step into the portrait gallery.â
 60206	
 60207	A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought
 60208	word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he
 60209	would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.
 60210	
 60211	In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her
 60212	another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess
 60213	always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were like
 60214	he never knew or remembered. âThis must be one of her companions,â he
 60215	thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.
 60216	
 60217	The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.
 60218	
 60219	âYes,â she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her
 60220	hand, âso this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very
 60221	last,â she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a
 60222	shyness that surprised him for an instant.
 60223	
 60224	âI was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good
 60225	news we had received for a long time.â
 60226	
 60227	Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more
 60228	uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre
 60229	interrupted her.
 60230	
 60231	âJust imagineâI knew nothing about him!â said he. âI thought he had been
 60232	killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know that
 60233	he fell in with the RostÃ³vs.... What a strange coincidence!â
 60234	
 60235	Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the
 60236	companionâs face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,
 60237	as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion
 60238	in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not
 60239	hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.
 60240	
 60241	But when he mentioned the RostÃ³vs, Princess Maryâs face expressed still
 60242	greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierreâs face to
 60243	that of the lady in the black dress and said:
 60244	
 60245	âDo you really not recognize her?â
 60246	
 60247	Pierre looked again at the companionâs pale, delicate face with its
 60248	black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten
 60249	and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes.
 60250	
 60251	âBut no, it canât be!â he thought. âThis stern, thin, pale face that
 60252	looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.â
 60253	But at that moment Princess Mary said, âNatÃ¡sha!â And with difficulty,
 60254	effort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its
 60255	hinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from
 60256	that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with
 60257	a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been
 60258	thinkingâespecially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and
 60259	enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible,
 60260	it was NatÃ¡sha and he loved her.
 60261	
 60262	At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,
 60263	and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware.
 60264	He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his
 60265	agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clearlyâclearer
 60266	than any words could have doneâdid he betray to himself, to her, and to
 60267	Princess Mary that he loved her.
 60268	
 60269	âNo, itâs only the unexpectedness of it,â thought Pierre. But as soon as
 60270	he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he
 60271	again glanced at NatÃ¡sha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and
 60272	a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He
 60273	became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was
 60274	saying.
 60275	
 60276	Pierre had failed to notice NatÃ¡sha because he did not at all expect to
 60277	see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in
 60278	her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but
 60279	that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the
 60280	moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with
 60281	a suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and
 60282	glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes
 60283	were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.
 60284	
 60285	Pierreâs confusion was not reflected by any confusion on NatÃ¡shaâs part,
 60286	but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.
 60287	
 60288	
 60289	
 60290	
 60291	
 60292	CHAPTER XVI
 60293	
 60294	âShe has come to stay with me,â said Princess Mary. âThe count and
 60295	countess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful
 60296	state; but it was necessary for NatÃ¡sha herself to see a doctor. They
 60297	insisted on her coming with me.â
 60298	
 60299	âYes, is there a family free from sorrow now?â said Pierre, addressing
 60300	NatÃ¡sha. âYou know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him.
 60301	What a delightful boy he was!â
 60302	
 60303	NatÃ¡sha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes
 60304	widened and lit up.
 60305	
 60306	âWhat can one say or think of as a consolation?â said Pierre. âNothing!
 60307	Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?â
 60308	
 60309	âYes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...â remarked
 60310	Princess Mary.
 60311	
 60312	âYes, yes, that is really true,â Pierre hastily interrupted her.
 60313	
 60314	âWhy is it true?â NatÃ¡sha asked, looking attentively into Pierreâs eyes.
 60315	
 60316	âHow can you ask why?â said Princess Mary. âThe thought alone of what
 60317	awaits...â
 60318	
 60319	NatÃ¡sha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked
 60320	inquiringly at Pierre.
 60321	
 60322	âAnd because,â Pierre continued, âonly one who believes that there is a
 60323	God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours.â
 60324	
 60325	NatÃ¡sha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped.
 60326	Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary,
 60327	asking about his friendâs last days.
 60328	
 60329	Pierreâs confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt
 60330	that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a
 60331	judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to
 60332	him than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was
 60333	considering what impression his words would make on NatÃ¡sha. He did
 60334	not purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he
 60335	regarded from her standpoint.
 60336	
 60337	Princess Maryâreluctantly as is usual in such casesâbegan telling of
 60338	the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But Pierreâs face
 60339	quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager restless expression,
 60340	gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall
 60341	for her own sake.
 60342	
 60343	âYes, yes, and so...?â Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with
 60344	his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. âYes, yes... so he
 60345	grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought
 60346	one thingâto be perfectly goodâso he could not be afraid of death. The
 60347	faults he hadâif he had anyâwere not of his making. So he did soften?...
 60348	What a happy thing that he saw you again,â he added, suddenly turning to
 60349	NatÃ¡sha and looking at her with eyes full of tears.
 60350	
 60351	NatÃ¡shaâs face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment.
 60352	She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.
 60353	
 60354	âYes, that was happiness,â she then said in her quiet voice with its
 60355	deep chest notes. âFor me it certainly was happiness.â She paused. âAnd
 60356	he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered
 60357	the room....â
 60358	
 60359	NatÃ¡shaâs voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her
 60360	knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her
 60361	head and began to speak rapidly.
 60362	
 60363	âWe knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to
 60364	ask about him. Then suddenly SÃ³nya told me he was traveling with us. I
 60365	had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was
 60366	to see him and be with him,â she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.
 60367	
 60368	And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had
 60369	never yet mentioned to anyoneâall she had lived through during those
 60370	three weeks of their journey and life at YaroslÃ¡vl.
 60371	
 60372	Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of
 60373	tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,
 60374	nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only pity for
 60375	her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.
 60376	
 60377	Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside
 60378	NatÃ¡sha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of
 60379	her brotherâs and NatÃ¡shaâs love.
 60380	
 60381	Evidently NatÃ¡sha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.
 60382	
 60383	She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of
 60384	her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she
 60385	repeated the same thing twice.
 60386	
 60387	Dessallesâ voice was heard outside the door asking whether little
 60388	Nicholas might come in to say good night.
 60389	
 60390	âWell, thatâs allâeverything,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 60391	
 60392	She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door
 60393	which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed
 60394	from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.
 60395	
 60396	Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not
 60397	understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.
 60398	
 60399	Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention
 60400	to her nephew who had entered the room.
 60401	
 60402	At that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholasâ face, which
 60403	resembled his fatherâs, affected Pierre so much that when he had kissed
 60404	the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and went to the
 60405	window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she would not let
 60406	him go.
 60407	
 60408	âNo, NatÃ¡sha and I sometimes donât go to sleep till after two, so please
 60409	donât go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately.â
 60410	
 60411	Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: âThis is the first
 60412	time she has talked of him like that.â
 60413	
 60414	
 60415	
 60416	
 60417	
 60418	CHAPTER XVII
 60419	
 60420	Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few minutes
 60421	later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with NatÃ¡sha. NatÃ¡sha
 60422	was calm, though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her
 60423	face. They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness
 60424	which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is
 60425	impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is
 60426	awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like
 60427	affectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the
 60428	chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin
 60429	and, resolving to break the silence, looked at NatÃ¡sha and at Princess
 60430	Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of
 60431	both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life
 60432	also has joy.
 60433	
 60434	âDo you take vodka, Count?â asked Princess Mary, and those words
 60435	suddenly banished the shadows of the past. âNow tell us about yourself,â
 60436	said she. âOne hears such improbable wonders about you.â
 60437	
 60438	âYes,â replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him.
 60439	âThey even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary AbrÃ¡movna
 60440	invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought
 60441	to have happened, to me. StepÃ¡n StepÃ¡nych also instructed me how I ought
 60442	to tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very
 60443	easy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people
 60444	invite me out and tell me all about myself.â
 60445	
 60446	NatÃ¡sha smiled and was on the point of speaking.
 60447	
 60448	âWe have been told,â Princess Mary interrupted her, âthat you lost two
 60449	millions in Moscow. Is that true?â
 60450	
 60451	âBut I am three times as rich as before,â returned Pierre.
 60452	
 60453	Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifeâs
 60454	debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had
 60455	become three times as rich as before.
 60456	
 60457	âWhat I have certainly gained is freedom,â he began seriously, but did
 60458	not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.
 60459	
 60460	âAnd are you building?â
 60461	
 60462	âYes. SavÃ©lich says I must!â
 60463	
 60464	âTell me, you did not know of the countessâ death when you decided to
 60465	remain in Moscow?â asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing
 60466	that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his
 60467	words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.
 60468	
 60469	âNo,â answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning
 60470	Princess Mary had given to his words. âI heard of it in OrÃ«l and you
 60471	cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,â he
 60472	added quickly, glancing at NatÃ¡sha and noticing on her face curiosity as
 60473	to how he would speak of his wife, âbut her death shocked me terribly.
 60474	When two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and oneâs own
 60475	guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer
 60476	alive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation!
 60477	I am very, very sorry for her,â he concluded, and was pleased to notice
 60478	a look of glad approval on NatÃ¡shaâs face.
 60479	
 60480	âYes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,â said Princess
 60481	Mary.
 60482	
 60483	Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look
 60484	at NatÃ¡sha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold,
 60485	stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.
 60486	
 60487	âAnd did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?â
 60488	said Princess Mary.
 60489	
 60490	Pierre laughed.
 60491	
 60492	âNo, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner
 60493	means being Napoleonâs guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard
 60494	nothing about himâI was in much lower company!â
 60495	
 60496	Supper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his
 60497	captivity was gradually led on to do so.
 60498	
 60499	âBut itâs true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?â NatÃ¡sha
 60500	asked with a slight smile. âI guessed it then when we met at the
 60501	SÃºkharev tower, do you remember?â
 60502	
 60503	Pierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by
 60504	Princess Maryâs questions and especially by NatÃ¡shaâs into giving a
 60505	detailed account of his adventures.
 60506	
 60507	At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with
 60508	him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came
 60509	to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was
 60510	unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed
 60511	emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he
 60512	has lived through.
 60513	
 60514	Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at
 60515	NatÃ¡sha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness.
 60516	NatÃ¡sha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly
 60517	changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never
 60518	wanderedâevidently herself experiencing all that he described. Not only
 60519	her look, but her exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed
 60520	Pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear
 60521	that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to,
 60522	but could not, express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident
 60523	with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was
 60524	this: âIt was an awful sightâchildren abandoned, some in the flames...
 60525	One was snatched out before my eyes... and there were women who had
 60526	their things snatched off and their earrings torn out...â he flushed and
 60527	grew confused. âThen a patrol arrived and all the menâall those who were
 60528	not looting, that isâwere arrested, and I among them.â
 60529	
 60530	âI am sure youâre not telling us everything; I am sure you did
 60531	something...â said NatÃ¡sha and pausing added, âsomething fine?â
 60532	
 60533	Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass
 60534	over the horrible details, but NatÃ¡sha insisted that he should not omit
 60535	anything.
 60536	
 60537	Pierre began to tell about KaratÃ¡ev, but paused. By this time he had
 60538	risen from the table and was pacing the room, NatÃ¡sha following him with
 60539	her eyes. Then he added:
 60540	
 60541	âNo, you canât understand what I learned from that illiterate manâthat
 60542	simple fellow.â
 60543	
 60544	âYes, yes, go on!â said NatÃ¡sha. âWhere is he?â
 60545	
 60546	âThey killed him almost before my eyes.â
 60547	
 60548	And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last
 60549	days of their retreat, of KaratÃ¡evâs illness and his death.
 60550	
 60551	He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as
 60552	it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was
 60553	telling it all to NatÃ¡sha he experienced that pleasure which a man has
 60554	when women listen to himânot clever women who when listening either try
 60555	to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity
 60556	offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their
 60557	own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their
 60558	little mental workshopâbut the pleasure given by real women gifted with
 60559	a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself.
 60560	NatÃ¡sha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word,
 60561	no single quiver in Pierreâs voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in
 60562	his face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its
 60563	flight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret
 60564	meaning of all Pierreâs mental travail.
 60565	
 60566	Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she
 60567	now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the
 60568	possibility of love and happiness between NatÃ¡sha and Pierre, and the
 60569	first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.
 60570	
 60571	It was three oâclock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and
 60572	stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.
 60573	
 60574	Pierre finished his story. NatÃ¡sha continued to look at him intently
 60575	with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand
 60576	something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced
 60577	and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what
 60578	to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It
 60579	occurred to none of them that it was three oâclock and time to go to
 60580	bed.
 60581	
 60582	âPeople speak of misfortunes and sufferings,â remarked Pierre, âbut if
 60583	at this moment I were asked: âWould you rather be what you were before
 60584	you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?â then for
 60585	heavenâs sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine
 60586	that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is
 60587	only then that what is new and good begins. While there is life there is
 60588	happiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you,â he added,
 60589	turning to NatÃ¡sha.
 60590	
 60591	âYes, yes,â she said, answering something quite different. âI too should
 60592	wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.â
 60593	
 60594	Pierre looked intently at her.
 60595	
 60596	âYes, and nothing more,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 60597	
 60598	âItâs not true, not true!â cried Pierre. âI am not to blame for being
 60599	alive and wishing to liveânor you either.â
 60600	
 60601	Suddenly NatÃ¡sha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and
 60602	began to cry.
 60603	
 60604	âWhat is it, NatÃ¡sha?â said Princess Mary.
 60605	
 60606	âNothing, nothing.â She smiled at Pierre through her tears. âGood night!
 60607	It is time for bed.â
 60608	
 60609	Pierre rose and took his leave.
 60610	
 60611	
 60612	Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of
 60613	what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of
 60614	Pierre nor did NatÃ¡sha speak of him.
 60615	
 60616	âWell, good night, Mary!â said NatÃ¡sha. âDo you know, I am often afraid
 60617	that by not speaking of himâ (she meant Prince Andrew) âfor fear of not
 60618	doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.â
 60619	
 60620	Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of
 60621	NatÃ¡shaâs remark, but she did not express agreement in words.
 60622	
 60623	âIs it possible to forget?â said she.
 60624	
 60625	âIt did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and
 60626	painful, but good, very good!â said NatÃ¡sha. âI am sure he really loved
 60627	him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?â she added, suddenly
 60628	blushing.
 60629	
 60630	âTo tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!â said Princess
 60631	Mary.
 60632	
 60633	âDo you know, Mary...â NatÃ¡sha suddenly said with a mischievous smile
 60634	such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, âhe has
 60635	somehow grown so clean, smooth, and freshâas if he had just come out of
 60636	a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isnât it true?â
 60637	
 60638	âYes,â replied Princess Mary. âHe has greatly improved.â
 60639	
 60640	âWith a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he
 60641	had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...â
 60642	
 60643	âI understand why heâ (Prince Andrew) âliked no one so much as him,â
 60644	said Princess Mary.
 60645	
 60646	âYes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they
 60647	are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike himâin
 60648	everything.â
 60649	
 60650	âYes, but heâs wonderful.â
 60651	
 60652	âWell, good night,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 60653	
 60654	And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as
 60655	if it had been forgotten there.
 60656	
 60657	
 60658	
 60659	
 60660	
 60661	CHAPTER XVIII
 60662	
 60663	It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced
 60664	up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem
 60665	and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now
 60666	smiling happily.
 60667	
 60668	He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of NatÃ¡sha, and of their love, at one
 60669	moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling.
 60670	It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the
 60671	room.
 60672	
 60673	âWell, whatâs to be done if it cannot be avoided? Whatâs to be done?
 60674	Evidently it has to be so,â said he to himself, and hastily undressing
 60675	he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or
 60676	indecision.
 60677	
 60678	âStrange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything
 60679	that she and I may be man and wife,â he told himself.
 60680	
 60681	A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the
 60682	Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, SavÃ©lich came to ask him about
 60683	packing for the journey.
 60684	
 60685	âWhat, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?â
 60686	he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. âOh, yes, long ago
 60687	before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,â
 60688	he reflected. âWhy? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and
 60689	how attentive, and how he remembers everything,â he thought, looking at
 60690	SavÃ©lichâs old face, âand what a pleasant smile he has!â
 60691	
 60692	âWell, SavÃ©lich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?â Pierre
 60693	asked him.
 60694	
 60695	âWhatâs the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the
 60696	late countâthe kingdom of heaven be his!âand we have lived under you
 60697	too, without ever being wronged.â
 60698	
 60699	âAnd your children?â
 60700	
 60701	âThe children will live just the same. With such masters one can live.â
 60702	
 60703	âBut what about my heirs?â said Pierre. âSupposing I suddenly marry...
 60704	it might happen,â he added with an involuntary smile.
 60705	
 60706	âIf I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.â
 60707	
 60708	âHow easy he thinks it,â thought Pierre. âHe doesnât know how terrible
 60709	it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!â
 60710	
 60711	âSo what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?â asked SavÃ©lich.
 60712	
 60713	âNo, Iâll put it off for a bit. Iâll tell you later. You must forgive
 60714	the trouble I have put you to,â said Pierre, and seeing SavÃ©lich smile,
 60715	he thought: âBut how strange it is that he should not know that now
 60716	there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of
 60717	all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall
 60718	I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?â Pierre reflected. âNo,
 60719	another time.â
 60720	
 60721	At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to
 60722	see Princess Mary the day before and had there metââWhom do you think?
 60723	NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va!â
 60724	
 60725	The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he
 60726	had seen Anna SemÃ«novna.
 60727	
 60728	âDo you know her?â asked Pierre.
 60729	
 60730	âI have seen the princess,â she replied. âI heard that they were
 60731	arranging a match for her with young RostÃ³v. It would be a very good
 60732	thing for the RostÃ³vs, they are said to be utterly ruined.â
 60733	
 60734	âNo; I mean do you know NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va?â
 60735	
 60736	âI heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.â
 60737	
 60738	âNo, she either doesnât understand or is pretending,â thought Pierre.
 60739	âBetter not say anything to her either.â
 60740	
 60741	The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierreâs journey.
 60742	
 60743	âHow kind they all are,â thought Pierre. âWhat is surprising is that
 60744	they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of
 60745	interest to them. And all for me!â
 60746	
 60747	On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send
 60748	a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be
 60749	returned to their owners that day.
 60750	
 60751	âAnd this man too,â thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief
 60752	of Police. âWhat a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy
 60753	bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest
 60754	and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldnât he take bribes?
 60755	Thatâs the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a
 60756	kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me.â
 60757	
 60758	Pierre went to Princess Maryâs to dinner.
 60759	
 60760	As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned
 60761	down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness
 60762	of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters
 60763	of the town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of
 60764	the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers,
 60765	the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women
 60766	hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming
 60767	eyes that seemed to say: âAh, there he is! Letâs see what will come of
 60768	it!â
 60769	
 60770	At the entrance to Princess Maryâs house Pierre felt doubtful whether
 60771	he had really been there the night before and really seen NatÃ¡sha and
 60772	talked to her. âPerhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find
 60773	no one there.â But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her
 60774	presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom. She
 60775	was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the
 60776	same way as the day before, yet she was quite different. Had she been
 60777	like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have
 60778	failed to recognize her.
 60779	
 60780	She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince
 60781	Andrewâs fiancÃ©e. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on
 60782	her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.
 60783	
 60784	Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but
 60785	Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.
 60786	
 60787	Next day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though
 60788	Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha were evidently glad to see their visitor and
 60789	though all Pierreâs interest was now centered in that house, by the
 60790	evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from
 60791	one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long
 60792	that Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha exchanged glances, evidently wondering
 60793	when he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy
 60794	and embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take
 60795	his leave.
 60796	
 60797	Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of
 60798	a headache began to say good night.
 60799	
 60800	âSo you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?â she asked.
 60801	
 60802	âNo, I am not going,â Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as
 60803	though offended. âYes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrowâbut I wonât say
 60804	good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,â
 60805	said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking
 60806	his departure.
 60807	
 60808	NatÃ¡sha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand
 60809	instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and
 60810	intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she
 60811	had plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and
 60812	long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.
 60813	
 60814	When NatÃ¡sha left the room Pierreâs confusion and awkwardness
 60815	immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly
 60816	moved an armchair toward Princess Mary.
 60817	
 60818	âYes, I wanted to tell you,â said he, answering her look as if she had
 60819	spoken. âPrincess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my
 60820	dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I
 60821	know itâs impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to
 60822	her. No, not that, I donât, I canât...â
 60823	
 60824	He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.
 60825	
 60826	âWell,â he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence.
 60827	âI donât know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her
 60828	alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without
 60829	her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that
 60830	perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that
 60831	possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?
 60832	Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!â he added after a pause, and
 60833	touched her hand as she did not reply.
 60834	
 60835	âI am thinking of what you have told me,â answered Princess Mary.
 60836	âThis is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at
 60837	present...â
 60838	
 60839	Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was
 60840	impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change
 60841	in NatÃ¡sha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre
 60842	spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.
 60843	
 60844	âTo speak to her now wouldnât do,â said the princess all the same.
 60845	
 60846	âBut what am I to do?â
 60847	
 60848	âLeave it to me,â said Princess Mary. âI know...â
 60849	
 60850	Pierre was looking into Princess Maryâs eyes.
 60851	
 60852	âWell?... Well?...â he said.
 60853	
 60854	âI know that she loves... will love you,â Princess Mary corrected
 60855	herself.
 60856	
 60857	Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened
 60858	expression seized Princess Maryâs hand.
 60859	
 60860	âWhat makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?â
 60861	
 60862	âYes, I think so,â said Princess Mary with a smile. âWrite to her
 60863	parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to
 60864	happen and my heart tells me it will.â
 60865	
 60866	âNo, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it canât be.... How happy I am!
 60867	No, it canât be!â Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Maryâs hands.
 60868	
 60869	âGo to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,â she
 60870	said.
 60871	
 60872	âTo Petersburg? Go there? Very well, Iâll go. But I may come again
 60873	tomorrow?â
 60874	
 60875	Next day Pierre came to say good-by. NatÃ¡sha was less animated than
 60876	she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre
 60877	sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she
 60878	existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. âIs it possible?
 60879	No, it canât be,â he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that
 60880	filled his soul with joy.
 60881	
 60882	When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help
 60883	holding it a little longer in his own.
 60884	
 60885	âIs it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure
 60886	of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one
 60887	day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, thatâs
 60888	impossible!...â
 60889	
 60890	âGood-by, Count,â she said aloud. âI shall look forward very much to
 60891	your return,â she added in a whisper.
 60892	
 60893	And these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which
 60894	accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible
 60895	memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre. ââI shall
 60896	look forward very much to your return....â Yes, yes, how did she say it?
 60897	Yes, âI shall look forward very much to your return.â Oh, how happy I
 60898	am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!â said Pierre to himself.
 60899	
 60900	
 60901	
 60902	
 60903	
 60904	CHAPTER XIX
 60905	
 60906	There was nothing in Pierreâs soul now at all like what had troubled it
 60907	during his courtship of HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
 60908	
 60909	He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words
 60910	he had spoken, or say: âOh, why did I not say that?â and, âWhatever made
 60911	me say âJe vous aimeâ?â On the contrary, he now repeated in imagination
 60912	every word that he or NatÃ¡sha had spoken and pictured every detail of
 60913	her face and smile, and did not wish to diminish or add anything, but
 60914	only to repeat it again and again. There was now not a shadow of doubt
 60915	in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong.
 60916	Only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: âWasnât it all
 60917	a dream? Isnât Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and
 60918	self-confident? I believe all thisâand suddenly Princess Mary will tell
 60919	her, and she will be sure to smile and say: âHow strange! He must be
 60920	deluding himself. Doesnât he know that he is a man, just a man, while
 60921	I...? I am something altogether different and higher.ââ
 60922	
 60923	That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any
 60924	plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only
 60925	he could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended
 60926	with that.
 60927	
 60928	A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable,
 60929	possessed him. The whole meaning of lifeânot for him alone but for the
 60930	whole worldâseemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of
 60931	being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with
 60932	one thing onlyâhis future happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that
 60933	other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to
 60934	hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In
 60935	every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He often
 60936	surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which
 60937	seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And when
 60938	he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied
 60939	them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them
 60940	that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of
 60941	attention.
 60942	
 60943	When it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service,
 60944	or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the
 60945	assumption that everybodyâs welfare depended on this or that issue
 60946	of events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise
 60947	people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everybodyâboth
 60948	those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that
 60949	is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not
 60950	understand itâin the bright light of the emotion that shone within
 60951	himself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met
 60952	everything that was good and worthy of being loved.
 60953	
 60954	When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory
 60955	aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he
 60956	now knew. Prince VasÃ­li, who having obtained a new post and some
 60957	fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed to him a
 60958	pathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.
 60959	
 60960	Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity. All
 60961	the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true
 60962	for him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently, but when
 60963	he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the views he had
 60964	held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct.
 60965	
 60966	âI may have appeared strange and queer then,â he thought, âbut I was
 60967	not so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had
 60968	more insight than at any other time, and understood all that is worth
 60969	understanding in life, because... because I was happy.â
 60970	
 60971	Pierreâs insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to
 60972	discover personal attributes which he termed âgood qualitiesâ in people
 60973	before loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by
 60974	loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving
 60975	them.
 60976	
 60977	
 60978	
 60979	
 60980	
 60981	CHAPTER XX
 60982	
 60983	After Pierreâs departure that first evening, when NatÃ¡sha had said to
 60984	Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: âHe looks just, yes, just as
 60985	if he had come out of a Russian bathâin a short coat and with his hair
 60986	cropped,â something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepressible,
 60987	awoke in NatÃ¡shaâs soul.
 60988	
 60989	Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.
 60990	To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the
 60991	surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to have
 60992	forgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer complained of her
 60993	position, did not say a word about the past, and no longer feared to
 60994	make happy plans for the future. She spoke little of Pierre, but when
 60995	Princess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled
 60996	in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile.
 60997	
 60998	The change that took place in NatÃ¡sha at first surprised Princess Mary;
 60999	but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. âCan she have loved
 61000	my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?â she thought
 61001	when she reflected on the change. But when she was with NatÃ¡sha she was
 61002	not vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power
 61003	of life that had seized NatÃ¡sha was so evidently irrepressible and
 61004	unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had
 61005	no right to reproach her even in her heart.
 61006	
 61007	NatÃ¡sha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that
 61008	she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright
 61009	and cheerful.
 61010	
 61011	When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with
 61012	Pierre, NatÃ¡sha met her on the threshold.
 61013	
 61014	âHe has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?â she repeated.
 61015	
 61016	And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for
 61017	her joy settled on NatÃ¡shaâs face.
 61018	
 61019	âI wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.â
 61020	
 61021	Understandable and touching as the look with which NatÃ¡sha gazed at
 61022	her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation,
 61023	these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his
 61024	love.
 61025	
 61026	âBut whatâs to be done? She canât help it,â thought the princess.
 61027	
 61028	And with a sad and rather stern look she told NatÃ¡sha all that Pierre
 61029	had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg NatÃ¡sha was
 61030	astounded.
 61031	
 61032	âTo Petersburg!â she repeated as if unable to understand.
 61033	
 61034	But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Maryâs face she guessed
 61035	the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.
 61036	
 61037	âMary,â said she, âtell me what I should do! I am afraid of being bad.
 61038	Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me....â
 61039	
 61040	âYou love him?â
 61041	
 61042	âYes,â whispered NatÃ¡sha.
 61043	
 61044	âThen why are you crying? I am happy for your sake,â said Princess Mary,
 61045	who because of those tears quite forgave NatÃ¡shaâs joy.
 61046	
 61047	âIt wonât be just yetâsomeday. Think what fun it will be when I am his
 61048	wife and you marry Nicholas!â
 61049	
 61050	âNatÃ¡sha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about you.â
 61051	
 61052	They were silent awhile.
 61053	
 61054	âBut why go to Petersburg?â NatÃ¡sha suddenly asked, and hastily replied
 61055	to her own question. âBut no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He must....â

 61067	CHAPTER I
 61068	
 61069	Seven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had
 61070	subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the
 61071	mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of
 61072	their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.
 61073	
 61074	Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the movement
 61075	of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups
 61076	of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of
 61077	kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation.
 61078	
 61079	The sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as
 61080	previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not
 61081	borne by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed
 61082	to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies,
 61083	who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars,
 61084	campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political
 61085	and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.
 61086	
 61087	The historians call this activity of the historical figures âthe
 61088	reaction.â
 61089	
 61090	In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical
 61091	personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the
 61092	reaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and
 61093	Napoleon to Madame de StaÃ«l, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand,
 61094	and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or
 61095	condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction.
 61096	
 61097	According to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia
 61098	also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according
 61099	to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement
 61100	of his reign, being the savior of Russia.
 61101	
 61102	There is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to
 61103	learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for
 61104	things he did wrong at this period of his reign.
 61105	
 61106	âHe ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he did
 61107	well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of
 61108	his reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution
 61109	to Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to ArakchÃ©ev,
 61110	favoring GolÃ­tsyn and mysticism, and afterwards ShishkÃ³v and Photius.
 61111	He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and
 61112	disbanding the SemÃ«nov regiment.â
 61113	
 61114	It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the
 61115	historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for
 61116	humanity.
 61117	
 61118	What do these reproaches mean?
 61119	
 61120	Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I
 61121	(the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with
 61122	Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)
 61123	flow from the same sourcesâthe circumstances of his birth, education,
 61124	and lifeâthat made his personality what it was and from which the
 61125	actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of
 61126	Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed?
 61127	
 61128	In what does the substance of those reproaches lie?
 61129	
 61130	It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,
 61131	standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the
 61132	blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those
 61133	strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception
 61134	inseparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life
 61135	felt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not
 61136	a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal
 61137	habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truthâthat
 61138	this characterâthough not lacking in virtue (the historians do not
 61139	accuse him of that)âhad not the same conception of the welfare of
 61140	humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his
 61141	youth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is, with books and
 61142	lectures and with taking notes from them.
 61143	
 61144	But even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in
 61145	his view of what was good for the people, we must inevitably assume that
 61146	the historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some
 61147	time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity.
 61148	This assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because, watching
 61149	the movement of history, we see that every year and with each new
 61150	writer, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what
 61151	once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is
 61152	more, we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to
 61153	what is bad and what is good in history: some people regard giving a
 61154	constitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in
 61155	Alexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.
 61156	
 61157	The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or
 61158	harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful.
 61159	If that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does
 61160	not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the
 61161	preservation of my fatherâs house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian
 61162	arms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the
 61163	freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in
 61164	Europe, or a certain kind of European culture called âprogressâ appear
 61165	to me to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the
 61166	action of every historic character has other more general purposes
 61167	inaccessible to me.
 61168	
 61169	But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all
 61170	contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by
 61171	which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander
 61172	could have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance
 61173	from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the
 61174	movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to
 61175	the program his present accusers would have given himâof nationality,
 61176	freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Let
 61177	us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated,
 61178	and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of the
 61179	activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in
 61180	the governmentâan activity that in the opinion of the historians was
 61181	good and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would
 61182	have been no life, there would have been nothing.
 61183	
 61184	If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of
 61185	life is destroyed.
 61186	
 61187	
 61188	
 61189	
 61190	
 61191	CHAPTER II
 61192	
 61193	If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the
 61194	attainment of certain endsâthe greatness of Russia or of France,
 61195	the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of the
 61196	Revolution, general progress, or anything elseâthen it is impossible
 61197	to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of
 61198	chance and genius.
 61199	
 61200	If the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth
 61201	century had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might have been
 61202	accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion. If
 61203	the aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have been attained
 61204	without the Revolution and without the Empire. If the aim was the
 61205	dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have accomplished that
 61206	much better than warfare. If the aim was the progress of civilization,
 61207	it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization
 61208	more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.
 61209	
 61210	Why did it happen in this and not in some other way?
 61211	
 61212	Because it happened so! âChance created the situation; genius utilized
 61213	it,â says history.
 61214	
 61215	But what is chance? What is genius?
 61216	
 61217	The words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and
 61218	therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of
 61219	understanding of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I
 61220	think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about
 61221	chance. I see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary
 61222	human agencies; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of
 61223	genius.
 61224	
 61225	To a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a
 61226	special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others
 61227	must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction
 61228	of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram,
 61229	who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a
 61230	special enclosure where there are oatsâthat this very ram, swelling with
 61231	fat, is killed for meat.
 61232	
 61233	But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them
 61234	happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only
 61235	admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken,
 61236	and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened
 61237	to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not know for what purpose
 61238	they are fattened, they will at least know that all that happened to the
 61239	ram did not happen accidentally, and will no longer need the conceptions
 61240	of chance or genius.
 61241	
 61242	Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately
 61243	intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our
 61244	ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of
 61245	historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce
 61246	(incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then the words
 61247	chance and genius become superfluous.
 61248	
 61249	We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European
 61250	convulsions and that we know only the factsâthat is, the murders, first
 61251	in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain,
 61252	and in Russiaâand that the movements from the west to the east and from
 61253	the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and
 61254	not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in
 61255	Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to
 61256	be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have
 61257	recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made
 61258	these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small
 61259	events were inevitable.
 61260	
 61261	By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall
 61262	clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for
 61263	any single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is
 61264	impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the
 61265	smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than Napoleon and
 61266	Alexander with all their antecedents.
 61267	
 61268	
 61269	
 61270	
 61271	
 61272	CHAPTER III
 61273	
 61274	The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the
 61275	beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of
 61276	the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west.
 61277	The commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east.
 61278	For the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement
 61279	to Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into
 61280	a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike
 61281	military group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established
 61282	traditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movement they
 61283	should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them
 61284	the deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to be committed
 61285	during that movement.
 61286	
 61287	And beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately large
 61288	group was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, and step
 61289	by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and
 61290	traditions, and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the
 61291	coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done.
 61292	
 61293	A man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without
 61294	a name, and not even a Frenchman, emergesâby what seem the strangest
 61295	chancesâfrom among all the seething French parties, and without joining
 61296	any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position.
 61297	
 61298	The ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of
 61299	his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and
 61300	self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the
 61301	army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy,
 61302	his opponentsâ reluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and
 61303	self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable so-called chances
 61304	accompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he falls with the
 61305	rulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to avoid his
 61306	predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian
 61307	service, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During
 61308	the war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and
 61309	each time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic
 61310	considerations the Russian armiesâjust those which might have destroyed
 61311	his prestigeâdo not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.
 61312	
 61313	On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process
 61314	of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped
 61315	out and destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous position
 61316	presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition
 61317	to Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies him. Impregnable Malta
 61318	surrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with
 61319	success. The enemyâs fleet, which subsequently did not let a single boat
 61320	pass, allows his entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole series of
 61321	outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. And the
 61322	men who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure themselves
 61323	that this is admirable, this is gloryâit resembles Caesar and Alexander
 61324	the Great and is therefore good.
 61325	
 61326	This ideal of glory and grandeurâwhich consists not merely in
 61327	considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every
 61328	crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural
 61329	significanceâthat ideal, destined to guide this man and his associates,
 61330	had scope for its development in Africa. Whatever he does succeeds. The
 61331	plague does not touch him. The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not
 61332	imputed to him as a fault. His childishly rash, uncalled-for, and
 61333	ignoble departure from Africa, leaving his comrades in distress, is
 61334	set down to his credit, and again the enemyâs fleet twice lets him slip
 61335	past. When, intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully,
 61336	he reaches Paris, the dissolution of the republican government, which a
 61337	year earlier might have ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and
 61338	his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can
 61339	only serve to exalt himâand though he himself has no plan, he is quite
 61340	ready for his new rÃ´le.
 61341	
 61342	He had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at
 61343	him and demanded his participation.
 61344	
 61345	He aloneâwith his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and
 61346	Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and frankness in
 61347	lyingâhe alone could justify what had to be done.
 61348	
 61349	He is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from
 61350	his will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his
 61351	mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and
 61352	the conspiracy is crowned with success.
 61353	
 61354	He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes to
 61355	flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon and
 61356	says senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once proud
 61357	and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are
 61358	even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have
 61359	said to destroy him and retain their power.
 61360	
 61361	Chance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by
 61362	agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the characters
 61363	of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character
 61364	of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives
 61365	a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his
 61366	power. Chance puts the Duc dâEnghien in his hands and unexpectedly
 61367	causes him to kill himâthereby convincing the mob more forcibly than
 61368	in any other way that he had the right, since he had the might.
 61369	Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an
 61370	expedition against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he
 61371	never carries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and
 61372	the Austrians, who surrender without a battle. Chance and genius give
 61373	him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the
 61374	French but all Europeâexcept England which does not take part in the
 61375	events about to happenâdespite their former horror and detestation of
 61376	his crimes, now recognize his authority, the title he has given
 61377	himself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and
 61378	reasonable to them all.
 61379	
 61380	As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the
 61381	western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807,
 61382	and 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of people that
 61383	had formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central
 61384	Europe. The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the
 61385	head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group. During
 61386	the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all
 61387	the crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the world can
 61388	oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of
 61389	glory and grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their
 61390	insignificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek
 61391	the great manâs mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that
 61392	this man receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the
 61393	guardian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the
 61394	aggrandizement of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself
 61395	for the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who
 61396	prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is
 61397	happening and has to happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud
 61398	he commits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once
 61399	represented as a great deed. The most suitable fÃªte the Germans can
 61400	devise for him is a celebration of Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt. Not only is he
 61401	great, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his
 61402	brothers-in-law. Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his
 61403	reason and to prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so
 61404	too are the forces.
 61405	
 61406	The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goalâMoscow. That
 61407	city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing
 61408	armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram. But
 61409	suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had
 61410	so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the
 61411	predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occurâfrom
 61412	the cold in his head at BorodinÃ³ to the sparks which set Moscow on
 61413	fire, and the frostsâand instead of genius, stupidity and immeasurable
 61414	baseness become evident.
 61415	
 61416	The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now
 61417	not for Napoleon but always against him.
 61418	
 61419	A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
 61420	remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.
 61421	Attempted drives from east to westâsimilar to the contrary movements of
 61422	1805, 1807, and 1809âprecede the great westward movement; there is the
 61423	same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion
 61424	of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation
 61425	midway, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.
 61426	
 61427	Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army
 61428	are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his
 61429	actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance
 61430	occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of
 61431	their sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his
 61432	craft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten
 61433	years previously and one year laterâan outlawed brigand. But by some
 61434	strange chance no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man
 61435	who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand
 61436	is sent to an island two daysâ sail from France, which for some reason
 61437	is presented to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and
 61438	millions of money are paid him.
 61439	
 61440	
 61441	
 61442	
 61443	
 61444	CHAPTER IV
 61445	
 61446	The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The
 61447	waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are
 61448	formed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have
 61449	caused the floods to abate.
 61450	
 61451	But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists
 61452	think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure
 61453	of natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the
 61454	position seems to them insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising
 61455	does not come from the quarter they expect. It rises again from the same
 61456	point as beforeâParis. The last backwash of the movement from the west
 61457	occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable
 61458	diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of
 61459	history.
 61460	
 61461	The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any
 61462	conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by
 61463	strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they
 61464	cursed the day before and will curse again a month later.
 61465	
 61466	This man is still needed to justify the final collective act.
 61467	
 61468	That act is performed.
 61469	
 61470	The last rÃ´le is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his
 61471	powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.
 61472	
 61473	And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself
 61474	in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies
 61475	when the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole
 61476	world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an
 61477	unseen hand directed his actions.
 61478	
 61479	The manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor
 61480	shows him to us.
 61481	
 61482	âSee what you believed in! This is he! Do you now see that it was not he
 61483	but I who moved you?â
 61484	
 61485	But dazed by the force of the movement, it was long before people
 61486	understood this.
 61487	
 61488	Still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of
 61489	Alexander I, the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from
 61490	east to west.
 61491	
 61492	What was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head of
 61493	that movement from east to west?
 61494	
 61495	What was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with European
 61496	affairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; a moral
 61497	superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him;
 61498	a mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance against
 61499	Napoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been
 61500	prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education,
 61501	his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by
 61502	Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.
 61503	
 61504	During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. But
 61505	as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he
 61506	appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of
 61507	Europe, led them to the goal.
 61508	
 61509	The goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all
 61510	possible power. How does he use it?
 61511	
 61512	Alexander Iâthe pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early years
 61513	had striven only for his peopleâs welfare, the originator of the liberal
 61514	innovations in his fatherlandânow that he seemed to possess the utmost
 61515	power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the
 61516	welfare of his peoplesâat the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing
 61517	up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy
 61518	had he retained powerâAlexander I, having fulfilled his mission and
 61519	feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance
 61520	of that supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands
 61521	of contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:
 61522	
 61523	âNot unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too am a man like the
 61524	rest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God.â
 61525	
 61526	As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and
 61527	yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to
 61528	comprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet
 61529	has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.
 61530	
 61531	A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid
 61532	of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the
 61533	bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the
 61534	fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from
 61535	flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey.
 61536	Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely
 61537	says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear
 61538	a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices
 61539	that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil
 61540	fertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the beeâs
 61541	existence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the
 61542	bee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the
 61543	bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first,
 61544	the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The
 61545	higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes,
 61546	the more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond our
 61547	comprehension.
 61548	
 61549	All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to
 61550	other manifestations of life. And so it is with the purpose of historic
 61551	characters and nations.

 61557	CHAPTER V
 61558	
 61559	NatÃ¡shaâs wedding to BezÃºkhov, which took place in 1813, was the last
 61560	happy event in the family of the old RostÃ³vs. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v died
 61561	that same year and, as always happens, after the fatherâs death the
 61562	family group broke up.
 61563	
 61564	The events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the flight
 61565	from it, the death of Prince Andrew, NatÃ¡shaâs despair, PÃ©tyaâs death,
 61566	and the old countessâ grief fell blow after blow on the old countâs
 61567	head. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these
 61568	events, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and
 61569	inviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightened
 61570	and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.
 61571	
 61572	The arrangements for NatÃ¡shaâs marriage occupied him for a while. He
 61573	ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but
 61574	his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it
 61575	evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.
 61576	
 61577	When Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to
 61578	complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his
 61579	bed. He realized from the first that he would not get up again, despite
 61580	the doctorâs encouragement. The countess passed a fortnight in an
 61581	armchair by his pillow without undressing. Every time she gave him
 61582	his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand. On his last day,
 61583	sobbing, he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having
 61584	dissipated their propertyâthat being the chief fault of which he was
 61585	conscious. After receiving communion and unction he quietly died; and
 61586	next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects
 61587	to the deceased filled the house rented by the RostÃ³vs. All these
 61588	acquaintances, who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so
 61589	often laughed at him, now said, with a common feeling of self-reproach
 61590	and emotion, as if justifying themselves: âWell, whatever he may have
 61591	been he was a most worthy man. You donât meet such men nowadays.... And
 61592	which of us has not weaknesses of his own?â
 61593	
 61594	It was just when the countâs affairs had become so involved that it was
 61595	impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he
 61596	unexpectedly died.
 61597	
 61598	Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his
 61599	fatherâs death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and
 61600	without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to
 61601	Moscow. The state of the countâs affairs became quite obvious a month
 61602	after his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of small
 61603	debts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amounted to
 61604	double the value of the property.
 61605	
 61606	Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But
 61607	he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his fatherâs memory, which he
 61608	held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the
 61609	inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.
 61610	
 61611	The creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague
 61612	but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the countâs
 61613	careless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once. As
 61614	always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get
 61615	paid first, and those who like MÃ­tenka held promissory notes given them
 61616	as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was
 61617	allowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed to pity
 61618	the old manâthe cause of their losses (if they were losses)ânow
 61619	remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the
 61620	debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them.
 61621	
 61622	Not one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold by
 61623	auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained
 61624	unpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his
 61625	brother-in-law BezÃºkhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due
 61626	for value received. And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as
 61627	the creditors threatened, he re-entered the government service.
 61628	
 61629	He could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at
 61630	the next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on
 61631	life; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who
 61632	had known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service,
 61633	he accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of
 61634	which he was so fond, and moved with his mother and SÃ³nya to a small
 61635	house on the SÃ­vtsev VrazhÃ³k.
 61636	
 61637	NatÃ¡sha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no
 61638	clear idea of Nicholasâ circumstances. Having borrowed money from his
 61639	brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him.
 61640	His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve
 61641	hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and SÃ³nya,
 61642	but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. The
 61643	countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she
 61644	had been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was
 61645	for her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to
 61646	send for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, or
 61647	wine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for NatÃ¡sha or
 61648	SÃ³nya, or for Nicholas himself.
 61649	
 61650	SÃ³nya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her
 61651	whims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty
 61652	from the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted
 61653	to SÃ³nya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her
 61654	patience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.
 61655	
 61656	He seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and
 61657	because there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that people
 61658	are valued for, but little that could have made him love her. He felt
 61659	that the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had taken her at
 61660	her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all
 61661	that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in
 61662	any case be renewed.
 61663	
 61664	Nicholasâ position became worse and worse. The idea of putting something
 61665	aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he not save
 61666	anything, but to comply with his motherâs demands he even incurred some
 61667	small debts. He could see no way out of this situation. The idea of
 61668	marrying some rich woman, which was suggested to him by his female
 61669	relations, was repugnant to him. The other way outâhis motherâs
 61670	deathânever entered his head. He wished for nothing and hoped
 61671	for nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern
 61672	satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position. He tried
 61673	to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive
 61674	offers of assistance; he avoided all distraction and recreation, and
 61675	even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother, pace silently
 61676	up and down the room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seemed
 61677	carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled
 61678	him to endure his position.
 61679	
 61680	
 61681	
 61682	
 61683	
 61684	CHAPTER VI
 61685	
 61686	At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports
 61687	current in town she learned how the RostÃ³vs were situated, and how âthe
 61688	son has sacrificed himself for his mother,â as people were saying.
 61689	
 61690	âI never expected anything else of him,â said Princess Mary to herself,
 61691	feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her friendly
 61692	relations with all the RostÃ³vs which had made her almost a member of the
 61693	family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But remembering her
 61694	relations with Nicholas in VorÃ³nezh she was shy about doing so. Making
 61695	a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her
 61696	arrival in Moscow.
 61697	
 61698	Nicholas was the first to meet her, as the countessâ room could only be
 61699	reached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she
 61700	had expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff,
 61701	proud expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her
 61702	health, led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes
 61703	left the room.
 61704	
 61705	When the princess came out of the countessâ room Nicholas met her again,
 61706	and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom.
 61707	To her remarks about his motherâs health he made no reply. âWhatâs that
 61708	to you? Leave me in peace,â his looks seemed to say.
 61709	
 61710	âWhy does she come prowling here? What does she want? I canât bear these
 61711	ladies and all these civilities!â said he aloud in SÃ³nyaâs presence,
 61712	evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princessâ carriage
 61713	had disappeared.
 61714	
 61715	âOh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?â cried SÃ³nya, hardly able to
 61716	conceal her delight. âShe is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!â
 61717	
 61718	Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any
 61719	more. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a
 61720	day.
 61721	
 61722	She sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, expressed
 61723	a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored when she
 61724	began to talk about her.
 61725	
 61726	Nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess,
 61727	but his silence irritated her.
 61728	
 61729	âShe is a very admirable and excellent young woman,â said she, âand you
 61730	must go and call on her. You would at least be seeing somebody, and I
 61731	think it must be dull for you only seeing us.â
 61732	
 61733	âBut I donât in the least want to, Mamma.â
 61734	
 61735	âYou used to want to, and now you donât. Really I donât understand you,
 61736	my dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see anyone.â
 61737	
 61738	âBut I never said I was dull.â
 61739	
 61740	âWhy, you said yourself you donât want even to see her. She is a very
 61741	admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you
 61742	have got some notion or other in your head. You hide everything from
 61743	me.â
 61744	
 61745	âNot at all, Mamma.â
 61746	
 61747	âIf I were asking you to do something disagreeable nowâbut I only ask
 61748	you to return a call. One would think mere politeness required it....
 61749	Well, I have asked you, and now I wonât interfere any more since you
 61750	have secrets from your mother.â
 61751	
 61752	âWell, then, Iâll go if you wish it.â
 61753	
 61754	âIt doesnât matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.â
 61755	
 61756	Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a
 61757	patience, trying to divert his motherâs attention to another topic.
 61758	
 61759	The same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the
 61760	day after that.
 61761	
 61762	After her visit to the RostÃ³vs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by
 61763	Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been right in
 61764	not wishing to be the first to call.
 61765	
 61766	âI expected nothing else,â she told herself, calling her pride to her
 61767	aid. âI have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the
 61768	old lady, who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many
 61769	obligations.â
 61770	
 61771	But she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin
 61772	to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she had
 61773	firmly resolved not to call on the RostÃ³vs again and to forget the whole
 61774	matter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position. And when
 61775	she asked herself what distressed her, she had to admit that it was her
 61776	relation to RostÃ³v. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling
 61777	for her (she knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could
 61778	discover what that something was, she felt that she could not be at
 61779	ease.
 61780	
 61781	One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her
 61782	nephewâs lessons, she was informed that RostÃ³v had called. With a firm
 61783	resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent
 61784	for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.
 61785	
 61786	Her first glance at Nicholasâ face told her that he had only come to
 61787	fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain
 61788	the tone in which he addressed her.
 61789	
 61790	They spoke of the countessâ health, of their mutual friends, of the
 61791	latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had
 61792	elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.
 61793	
 61794	With Mademoiselle Bourienneâs help the princess had maintained the
 61795	conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose,
 61796	she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her
 61797	mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little
 61798	happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her
 61799	luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had risen.
 61800	
 61801	Nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her
 61802	abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then
 61803	again looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of
 61804	suffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was
 61805	vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face
 61806	expressed. He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could
 61807	think of nothing to say.
 61808	
 61809	âGood-by, Princess!â said he.
 61810	
 61811	She started, flushed, and sighed deeply.
 61812	
 61813	âOh, I beg your pardon,â she said as if waking up. âAre you going
 61814	already, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the
 61815	countess!â
 61816	
 61817	âWait a moment, Iâll fetch it,â said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she
 61818	left the room.
 61819	
 61820	They both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.
 61821	
 61822	âYes, Princess,â said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, âit doesnât
 61823	seem long ago since we first met at BoguchÃ¡rovo, but how much water
 61824	has flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet
 61825	I would give much to bring back that time... but thereâs no bringing it
 61826	back.â
 61827	
 61828	Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones
 61829	as he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of
 61830	his words which would explain his feeling for her.
 61831	
 61832	âYes, yes,â said she, âbut you have no reason to regret the past, Count.
 61833	As I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it
 61834	with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now...â
 61835	
 61836	âI cannot accept your praise,â he interrupted her hurriedly. âOn the
 61837	contrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an
 61838	interesting or cheerful subject.â
 61839	
 61840	His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the
 61841	princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it
 61842	was to him that she now spoke.
 61843	
 61844	âI thought you would allow me to tell you this,â she said. âI had come
 61845	so near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not
 61846	consider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,â and suddenly her
 61847	voice trembled. âI donât know why,â she continued, recovering herself,
 61848	âbut you used to be different, and...â
 61849	
 61850	âThere are a thousand reasons why,â laying special emphasis on the why.
 61851	âThank you, Princess,â he added softly. âSometimes it is hard.â
 61852	
 61853	âSo thatâs why! Thatâs why!â a voice whispered in Princess Maryâs soul.
 61854	âNo, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that
 61855	handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble, resolute,
 61856	self-sacrificing spirit too,â she said to herself. âYes, he is poor now
 61857	and I am rich.... Yes, thatâs the only reason.... Yes, were it not for
 61858	that...â And remembering his former tenderness, and looking now at his
 61859	kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness.
 61860	
 61861	âBut why, Count, why?â she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer to
 61862	him. âWhy? Tell me. You must tell me!â
 61863	
 61864	He was silent.
 61865	
 61866	âI donât understand your why, Count,â she continued, âbut itâs hard for
 61867	me... I confess it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of our former
 61868	friendship. And that hurts me.â There were tears in her eyes and in her
 61869	voice. âI have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard
 61870	for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!â and suddenly she began to cry
 61871	and was hurrying from the room.
 61872	
 61873	âPrincess, for Godâs sake!â he exclaimed, trying to stop her.
 61874	âPrincess!â
 61875	
 61876	She turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one
 61877	anotherâs eyesâand what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became
 61878	possible, inevitable, and very near.
 61879	
 61880	
 61881	
 61882	
 61883	
 61884	CHAPTER VII
 61885	
 61886	In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald
 61887	Hills with his wife, his mother, and SÃ³nya.
 61888	
 61889	Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without
 61890	selling any of his wifeâs property, and having received a small
 61891	inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well.
 61892	
 61893	In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he
 61894	was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating
 61895	to buy back OtrÃ¡dnoeâthat being his pet dream.
 61896	
 61897	Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it
 61898	that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was
 61899	a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones
 61900	then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate
 61901	management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products,
 61902	and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any
 61903	particular part of the work on his estate. He always had before his
 61904	mindâs eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The
 61905	chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen
 61906	in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important
 61907	agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made
 61908	effectiveâthe peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming
 61909	and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who
 61910	especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely
 61911	a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first
 61912	he watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they
 61913	considered good and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give
 61914	orders while in reality learning from them their methods, their manner
 61915	of speech, and their judgment of what was good and bad. Only when he
 61916	had understood the peasantsâ tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk
 61917	their language, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt
 61918	akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to
 61919	perform toward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholasâ management
 61920	produced very brilliant results.
 61921	
 61922	Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the
 61923	estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and
 61924	delegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they
 61925	had the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before
 61926	analyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and
 61927	credit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the
 61928	peasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He kept the
 61929	peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not allowing
 61930	the family groups to divide into separate households. He was hard alike
 61931	on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled
 61932	from the commune.
 61933	
 61934	He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasantsâ hay
 61935	and corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown
 61936	and harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did
 61937	Nicholas.
 61938	
 61939	He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfsâthe âdronesâ
 61940	as he called themâand everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When
 61941	a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one
 61942	had to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in
 61943	the house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted
 61944	instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He
 61945	never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his
 61946	every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.
 61947	
 61948	He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to
 61949	make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined
 61950	to do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he
 61951	should or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in
 61952	his own mind.
 61953	
 61954	Often, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would
 61955	say: âWhat can one do with our Russian peasants?â and imagined that he
 61956	could not bear them.
 61957	
 61958	Yet he loved âour Russian peasantsâ and their way of life with his whole
 61959	soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one
 61960	way and manner of farming which produced good results.
 61961	
 61962	Countess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husbandâs and regretted
 61963	that she could not share it; but she could not understand the joys and
 61964	vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote and alien. She
 61965	could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy
 61966	when, after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the
 61967	fields or on the threshing floor, he returned from the sowing or mowing
 61968	or reaping to have tea with her. She did not understand why he spoke
 61969	with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and
 61970	well-to-do peasant Matthew ErmÃ­shin, who with his family had carted
 61971	corn all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholasâ) sheaves were already
 61972	stacked before anyone else had his harvest in. She did not understand
 61973	why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his
 61974	mustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall
 61975	on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind
 61976	carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return
 61977	from the barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of
 61978	wormwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would
 61979	say: âWell, one more day and my grain and the peasantsâ will all be
 61980	under cover.â
 61981	
 61982	Still less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to
 61983	anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought
 61984	him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her
 61985	to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately
 61986	refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her
 61987	business. She felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and
 61988	which had laws she had not fathomed.
 61989	
 61990	Sometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he
 61991	was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: âNot in the least;
 61992	it never entered my head and I wouldnât do that for their good! Thatâs
 61993	all poetry and old wivesâ talkâall that doing good to oneâs neighbor!
 61994	What I want is that our children should not have to go begging. I must
 61995	put our affairs in order while I am alive, thatâs all. And to do that,
 61996	order and strictness are essential.... Thatâs all about it!â said he,
 61997	clenching his vigorous fist. âAnd fairness, of course,â he added, âfor
 61998	if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he
 61999	can do no good either for himself or for me.â
 62000	
 62001	And all Nicholas did was fruitfulâprobably just because he refused to
 62002	allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtueâs
 62003	sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came
 62004	to beg him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his
 62005	administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs. âHe was a
 62006	master... the peasantsâ affairs first and then his own. Of course he was
 62007	not to be trifled with eitherâin a word, he was a real master!â
 62008	
 62009	
 62010	
 62011	
 62012	
 62013	CHAPTER VIII
 62014	
 62015	One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas, and
 62016	that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making
 62017	free use of his fists. At first he saw nothing reprehensible in
 62018	this, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of
 62019	punishment suddenly changed.
 62020	
 62021	Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from BoguchÃ¡rovo, a
 62022	man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of
 62023	dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch
 62024	to question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies
 62025	the sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas
 62026	went up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery
 62027	frame, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that
 62028	morning. Among other things he spoke of the BoguchÃ¡rovo elder. Countess
 62029	Mary turned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and
 62030	lips compressed and gave her husband no reply.
 62031	
 62032	âSuch an insolent scoundrel!â he cried, growing hot again at the mere
 62033	recollection of him. âIf he had told me he was drunk and did not see...
 62034	But what is the matter with you, Mary?â he suddenly asked.
 62035	
 62036	Countess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked
 62037	down again and her lips puckered.
 62038	
 62039	âWhy, whatever is the matter, my dearest?â
 62040	
 62041	The looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in
 62042	tears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow or
 62043	pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm.
 62044	
 62045	The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself
 62046	and began to cry.
 62047	
 62048	âNicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!â and
 62049	she covered her face with her hands.
 62050	
 62051	Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up
 62052	and down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could
 62053	not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded
 62054	from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong. âIs it just
 62055	sentimentality, old wivesâ tales, or is she right?â he asked himself.
 62056	Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with
 62057	love and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he
 62058	had long been sinning against himself.
 62059	
 62060	âMary,â he said softly, going up to her, âit will never happen again;
 62061	I give you my word. Never,â he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy
 62062	asking for forgiveness.
 62063	
 62064	The tears flowed faster still from the countessâ eyes. She took his hand
 62065	and kissed it.
 62066	
 62067	âNicholas, when did you break your cameo?â she asked to change the
 62068	subject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of
 62069	LaocoÃ¶nâs head.
 62070	
 62071	âTodayâit was the same affair. Oh, Mary, donât remind me of it!â and
 62072	again he flushed. âI give you my word of honor it shanât occur again,
 62073	and let this always be a reminder to me,â and he pointed to the broken
 62074	ring.
 62075	
 62076	After that, when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the
 62077	blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would
 62078	turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the
 62079	man who was making him angry. But he did forget himself once or twice
 62080	within a twelvemonth, and then he would go and confess to his wife, and
 62081	would again promise that this should really be the very last time.
 62082	
 62083	âMary, you must despise me!â he would say. âI deserve it.â
 62084	
 62085	âYou should go, go away at once, if you donât feel strong enough to
 62086	control yourself,â she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.
 62087	
 62088	Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked.
 62089	He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and
 62090	consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The
 62091	whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work
 62092	on his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same
 62093	business-like seriousnessâleaving home for a month, or even two, with
 62094	his hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time
 62095	reading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he
 62096	spent a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious
 62097	library, and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought.
 62098	He would sit in his study with a grave air, readingâa task he first
 62099	imposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwards became a habit
 62100	affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of
 62101	being occupied with serious matters. In winter, except for business
 62102	excursions, he spent most of his time at home making himself one with
 62103	his family and entering into all the details of his childrenâs relations
 62104	with their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and
 62105	closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her.
 62106	
 62107	From the time of his marriage SÃ³nya had lived in his house. Before
 62108	that, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and
 62109	SÃ³nya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess Mary to
 62110	be gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrong he
 62111	had done SÃ³nya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her
 62112	wealth had influenced Nicholasâ choice. She could not find fault with
 62113	SÃ³nya in any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will
 62114	toward her which she could not overcome.
 62115	
 62116	Once she had a talk with her friend NatÃ¡sha about SÃ³nya and about her
 62117	own injustice toward her.
 62118	
 62119	âYou know,â said NatÃ¡sha, âyou have read the Gospels a great dealâthere
 62120	is a passage in them that just fits SÃ³nya.â
 62121	
 62122	âWhat?â asked Countess Mary, surprised.
 62123	
 62124	ââTo him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be
 62125	taken away.â You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I donât know.
 62126	Perhaps she lacks egotism, I donât know, but from her is taken away, and
 62127	everything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her.
 62128	Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had
 62129	a sort of presentiment that it would not come off. She is a sterile
 62130	flower, you knowâlike some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for
 62131	her, and sometimes I think she doesnât feel it as you or I would.â
 62132	
 62133	Though Countess Mary told NatÃ¡sha that those words in the Gospel must be
 62134	understood differently, yet looking at SÃ³nya she agreed with NatÃ¡shaâs
 62135	explanation. It really seemed that SÃ³nya did not feel her position
 62136	trying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower.
 62137	She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a
 62138	whole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the people but to the
 62139	home. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children,
 62140	was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift,
 62141	and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient
 62142	gratitude.
 62143	
 62144	The country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the same
 62145	scale as under the old prince.
 62146	
 62147	The buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than
 62148	simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,
 62149	plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with
 62150	very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own
 62151	serf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious
 62152	and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole
 62153	families of the RostÃ³vsâ and BolkÃ³nskisâ relations sometimes came to
 62154	Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for
 62155	months. Besides that, four times a year, on the name days and birthdays
 62156	of the hosts, as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day
 62157	or two. The rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its
 62158	ordinary occupations, and its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers,
 62159	provided out of the produce of the estate.
 62160	
 62161	
 62162	
 62163	
 62164	
 62165	CHAPTER IX
 62166	
 62167	It was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. NatÃ¡sha had
 62168	been staying at her brotherâs with her husband and children since early
 62169	autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three
 62170	weeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was
 62171	expected back every minute.
 62172	
 62173	Besides the BezÃºkhov family, Nicholasâ old friend the retired General
 62174	VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich DenÃ­sov was staying with the RostÃ³vs this fifth of
 62175	December.
 62176	
 62177	On the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of
 62178	visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for
 62179	a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to
 62180	the new church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to
 62181	congratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections
 62182	of the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve
 62183	of that day in his usual way. He examined the bailiffâs accounts of
 62184	the village in RyazÃ¡n which belonged to his wifeâs nephew, wrote two
 62185	business letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and
 62186	stables before dinner. Having taken precautions against the general
 62187	drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saintâs
 62188	day, he returned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk
 62189	with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at
 62190	which the whole household had assembled. At that table were his mother,
 62191	his motherâs old lady companion BelÃ³va, his wife, their three children
 62192	with their governess and tutor, his wifeâs nephew with his tutor, SÃ³nya,
 62193	DenÃ­sov, NatÃ¡sha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael
 62194	IvÃ¡novich, the late princeâs architect, who was living on in retirement
 62195	at Bald Hills.
 62196	
 62197	Countess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband took
 62198	his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking
 62199	up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing
 62200	before him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when
 62201	he came in to dinner straight from the farmâespecially before the soup.
 62202	Countess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in
 62203	a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then
 62204	began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his
 62205	ill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should
 62206	be angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked
 62207	him where he had been. He replied. She again inquired whether
 62208	everything was going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince
 62209	unpleasantly and he replied hastily.
 62210	
 62211	âThen Iâm not mistaken,â thought Countess Mary. âWhy is he cross with
 62212	me?â She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished
 62213	to end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but
 62214	could not refrain from asking some more questions.
 62215	
 62216	Thanks to DenÃ­sov the conversation at table soon became general and
 62217	lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table
 62218	and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her
 62219	hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.
 62220	
 62221	âYou always have such strange fancies! I didnât even think of being
 62222	angry,â he replied.
 62223	
 62224	But the word always seemed to her to imply: âYes, I am angry but I wonât
 62225	tell you why.â
 62226	
 62227	Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even SÃ³nya and the
 62228	old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree,
 62229	could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their
 62230	moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they
 62231	had been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement
 62232	and hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Maryâs
 62233	pregnancies, and this was such a time.
 62234	
 62235	âWell, messieurs et mesdames,â said Nicholas loudly and with apparent
 62236	cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to
 62237	vex her), âI have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I
 62238	shall have to suffer, so today Iâll go and rest.â
 62239	
 62240	And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and
 62241	lay down on the sofa.
 62242	
 62243	âThatâs always the way,â thought Countess Mary. âHe talks to everyone
 62244	except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I
 62245	am in this condition.â She looked down at her expanded figure and in the
 62246	glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked
 62247	larger than ever.
 62248	
 62249	And everything annoyed herâDenÃ­sovâs shouting and laughter, NatÃ¡shaâs
 62250	talk, and especially a quick glance SÃ³nya gave her.
 62251	
 62252	SÃ³nya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling
 62253	irritated.
 62254	
 62255	Having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of
 62256	what they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.
 62257	
 62258	The children were playing at âgoing to Moscowâ in a carriage made of
 62259	chairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with
 62260	them a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable
 62261	crossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with
 62262	difficulty, went to the small sitting room.
 62263	
 62264	âPerhaps he is not asleep; Iâll have an explanation with him,â she
 62265	said to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,
 62266	followed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him.
 62267	
 62268	âMary, dear, I think he is asleepâhe was so tired,â said SÃ³nya, meeting
 62269	her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she
 62270	crossed her path everywhere). âAndrew may wake him.â
 62271	
 62272	Countess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that
 62273	SÃ³nya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident
 62274	difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but
 62275	to avoid obeying SÃ³nya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went
 62276	to the door. SÃ³nya went away by another door. From the room in which
 62277	Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every
 62278	slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it
 62279	she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his
 62280	whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night
 62281	when he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at
 62282	that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: âPapa! Mammaâs
 62283	standing here!â Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs
 62284	to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to
 62285	Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through
 62286	the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and
 62287	his voice said crossly:
 62288	
 62289	âI canât get a momentâs peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring
 62290	him here?â
 62291	
 62292	âI only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....â
 62293	
 62294	Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the
 62295	door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little
 62296	black-eyed three-year-old NatÃ¡sha, her fatherâs pet, having learned from
 62297	her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran
 62298	to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly
 62299	opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of
 62300	her sturdy little legs, and having examined the position of her father,
 62301	who was asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand
 62302	which lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his
 62303	face.
 62304	
 62305	âNatÃ¡sha, NatÃ¡sha!â came Countess Maryâs frightened whisper from the
 62306	door. âPapa wants to sleep.â
 62307	
 62308	âNo, Mamma, he doesnât want to sleep,â said little NatÃ¡sha with
 62309	conviction. âHeâs laughing.â
 62310	
 62311	Nicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.
 62312	
 62313	âCome in, Mary,â he said to his wife.
 62314	
 62315	She went in and sat down by her husband.
 62316	
 62317	âI did not notice him following me,â she said timidly. âI just looked
 62318	in.â
 62319	
 62320	Holding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife and,
 62321	seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and kissed
 62322	her hair.
 62323	
 62324	âMay I kiss Mamma?â he asked NatÃ¡sha.
 62325	
 62326	NatÃ¡sha smiled bashfully.
 62327	
 62328	âAgain!â she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot
 62329	where Nicholas had placed the kiss.
 62330	
 62331	âI donât know why you think I am cross,â said Nicholas, replying to the
 62332	question he knew was in his wifeâs mind.
 62333	
 62334	âYou have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are like
 62335	that. It always seems to me...â
 62336	
 62337	âMary, donât talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!â he
 62338	said gaily.
 62339	
 62340	âIt seems to be that you canât love me, that I am so plain... always...
 62341	and now... in this cond...â
 62342	
 62343	âOh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, itâs love that
 62344	makes us see beauty. It is only MalvÃ­nas and women of that kind who are
 62345	loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I donât love her, but...
 62346	I donât know how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between
 62347	us like this, I seem lost and canât do anything. Now do I love my
 62348	finger? I donât love it, but just try to cut it off!â
 62349	
 62350	âIâm not like that myself, but I understand. So youâre not angry with
 62351	me?â
 62352	
 62353	âAwfully angry!â he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing his hair
 62354	he began to pace the room.
 62355	
 62356	âDo you know, Mary, what Iâve been thinking?â he began, immediately
 62357	thinking aloud in his wifeâs presence now that they had made it up.
 62358	
 62359	He did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A
 62360	thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he told
 62361	her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.
 62362	
 62363	Countess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in
 62364	her turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the children.
 62365	
 62366	âYou can see the woman in her already,â she said in French, pointing to
 62367	little NatÃ¡sha. âYou reproach us women with being illogical. Here is our
 62368	logic. I say: âPapa wants to sleep!â but she says, âNo, heâs laughing.â
 62369	And she was right,â said Countess Mary with a happy smile.
 62370	
 62371	âYes, yes.â And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong hand,
 62372	lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the legs, and
 62373	paced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree happiness
 62374	on the faces of both father and daughter.
 62375	
 62376	âBut you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,â his wife
 62377	whispered in French.
 62378	
 62379	âYes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...â
 62380	
 62381	At that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in
 62382	the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.
 62383	
 62384	âSomebody has come.â
 62385	
 62386	âI am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,â said Countess Mary and left
 62387	the room.
 62388	
 62389	In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a
 62390	gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly
 62391	from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded
 62392	him of dancing, and looking at the childâs round happy little face he
 62393	thought of what she would be like when he was an old man, taking her
 62394	into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had
 62395	danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.
 62396	
 62397	âIt is he, it is he, Nicholas!â said Countess Mary, re-entering the room
 62398	a few minutes later. âNow our NatÃ¡sha has come to life. You should have
 62399	seen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long.
 62400	Well, come along now, quick, quick! Itâs time you two were parted,â she
 62401	added, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.
 62402	
 62403	Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand.
 62404	
 62405	Countess Mary remained in the sitting room.
 62406	
 62407	âI should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,â she
 62408	whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time she
 62409	sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she
 62410	felt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of happiness
 62411	unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that
 62412	instant.
 62413	
 62414	
 62415	
 62416	
 62417	
 62418	CHAPTER X
 62419	
 62420	NatÃ¡sha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had
 62421	three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was
 62422	now nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was difficult
 62423	to recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively NatÃ¡sha of
 62424	former days. Her features were more defined and had a calm, soft,
 62425	and serene expression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing
 62426	animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm.
 62427	Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was
 62428	not visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and
 62429	fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That
 62430	happened only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home,
 62431	or a sick child was convalescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke of
 62432	Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband, who she imagined
 62433	was jealous of Prince Andrewâs memory), or on the rare occasions when
 62434	something happened to induce her to sing, a practice she had quite
 62435	abandoned since her marriage. At the rare moments when the old fire
 62436	did kindle in her handsome, fully developed body she was even more
 62437	attractive than in former days.
 62438	
 62439	Since their marriage NatÃ¡sha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in
 62440	Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to
 62441	say, in Nicholasâ house. The young Countess BezÃºkhova was not often seen
 62442	in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her
 62443	and found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that NatÃ¡sha liked
 62444	solitudeâshe did not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought
 62445	that she did notâbut with her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing
 62446	of her children, and sharing every moment of her husbandâs life, she had
 62447	demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society.
 62448	All who had known NatÃ¡sha before her marriage wondered at the change
 62449	in her as at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with her
 62450	maternal instinct had realized that all NatÃ¡shaâs outbursts had been due
 62451	to her need of children and a husbandâas she herself had once exclaimed
 62452	at OtrÃ¡dnoe not so much in fun as in earnestâand her mother was now
 62453	surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood
 62454	NatÃ¡sha, and she kept saying that she had always known that NatÃ¡sha
 62455	would make an exemplary wife and mother.
 62456	
 62457	âOnly she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all
 62458	bounds,â said the countess, âso that it even becomes absurd.â
 62459	
 62460	NatÃ¡sha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,
 62461	especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself
 62462	go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be
 62463	even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and
 62464	should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her
 62465	husband. NatÃ¡sha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery,
 62466	of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up
 62467	just because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with
 62468	her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show
 62469	herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid
 62470	inconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradiction
 62471	to all those rules. She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly
 62472	taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of
 62473	her husband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up
 62474	entirelyâthat is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden
 62475	from him. She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained
 62476	by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something
 62477	elseâindefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul.
 62478	
 62479	To fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic
 62480	songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn
 62481	herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps
 62482	have been agreeableâshe did not knowâbut she had no time at all for it.
 62483	The chief reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress, or
 62484	to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these
 62485	things.
 62486	
 62487	We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in
 62488	a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so
 62489	trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if oneâs entire
 62490	attention is devoted to it.
 62491	
 62492	The subject which wholly engrossed NatÃ¡shaâs attention was her family:
 62493	that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong
 62494	entirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she had to bear,
 62495	bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.
 62496	
 62497	And the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole
 62498	soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger
 62499	did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers
 62500	appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet
 62501	was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.
 62502	
 62503	There were then as now conversations and discussions about womenâs
 62504	rights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights,
 62505	though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but
 62506	these topics were not merely uninteresting to NatÃ¡sha, she positively
 62507	did not understand them.
 62508	
 62509	These questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing in
 62510	marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that is,
 62511	only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance, which
 62512	lies in the family.
 62513	
 62514	Discussions and questions of that kind, which are like the question of
 62515	how to get the greatest gratification from oneâs dinner, did not then
 62516	and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the
 62517	nourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is the family.
 62518	
 62519	If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two
 62520	dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his
 62521	purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.
 62522	
 62523	If the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have
 62524	many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that
 62525	case will not have a family.
 62526	
 62527	If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the
 62528	family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one
 62529	can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for
 62530	the familyâthat is, one wife or one husband. NatÃ¡sha needed a husband. A
 62531	husband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw no
 62532	need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul
 62533	were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine
 62534	and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were
 62535	different.
 62536	
 62537	NatÃ¡sha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the
 62538	society of her relativesâCountess Mary, and her brother, her mother, and
 62539	SÃ³nya. She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding
 62540	disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with joyful face
 62541	show a yellow instead of a green stain on babyâs napkin, and from whom
 62542	she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better.
 62543	
 62544	To such an extent had NatÃ¡sha let herself go that the way she dressed
 62545	and did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousyâshe was jealous
 62546	of SÃ³nya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plainâwere
 62547	habitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general opinion was
 62548	that Pierre was under his wifeâs thumb, which was really true. From the
 62549	very first days of their married life NatÃ¡sha had announced her demands.
 62550	Pierre was greatly surprised by his wifeâs view, to him a perfectly
 62551	novel one, that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the
 62552	family. His wifeâs demands astonished him, but they also flattered him,
 62553	and he submitted to them.
 62554	
 62555	Pierreâs subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not
 62556	flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did
 62557	not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a
 62558	whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on
 62559	businessâin which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which
 62560	she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great
 62561	importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the right to
 62562	regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose. At
 62563	home NatÃ¡sha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband,
 62564	and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupiedâthat is, was
 62565	reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiality for
 62566	anything to get just what he liked done always. He had only to express a
 62567	wish and NatÃ¡sha would jump up and run to fulfill it.
 62568	
 62569	The entire household was governed according to Pierreâs supposed orders,
 62570	that is, by his wishes which NatÃ¡sha tried to guess. Their way of
 62571	life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, NatÃ¡shaâs
 62572	occupations, the childrenâs upbringing, were all selected not merely
 62573	with regard to Pierreâs expressed wishes, but to what NatÃ¡sha from the
 62574	thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she
 62575	deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once
 62576	arrived at them clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to
 62577	change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons.
 62578	
 62579	Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their
 62580	first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse
 62581	three times and NatÃ¡sha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her
 62582	of Rousseauâs view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet
 62583	nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite
 62584	the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband
 62585	himselfâwho were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself,
 62586	a thing then unheard of and considered injuriousâshe insisted on having
 62587	her own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.
 62588	
 62589	It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife
 62590	would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and
 62591	delight would find in his wifeâs ideas and actions the very thought
 62592	against which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous
 62593	that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his
 62594	opinion.
 62595	
 62596	After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm
 62597	consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw
 62598	himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself
 62599	inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in
 62600	him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected.
 62601	And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and
 62602	mysterious reflection.
 62603	
 62604	
 62605	
 62606	
 62607	
 62608	CHAPTER XI
 62609	
 62610	Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the RostÃ³vs
 62611	he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come
 62612	to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being
 62613	discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal
 62614	founders.
 62615	
 62616	On reading that letter (she always read her husbandâs letters) NatÃ¡sha
 62617	herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel
 62618	his absence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all
 62619	her husbandâs intellectual and abstract interests though she did not
 62620	understand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such
 62621	matters. To Pierreâs timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she
 62622	replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return.
 62623	He was given four weeksâ leave of absence.
 62624	
 62625	Ever since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight
 62626	before, NatÃ¡sha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and
 62627	irritability.
 62628	
 62629	DenÃ­sov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with
 62630	the present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He
 62631	looked at NatÃ¡sha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a
 62632	person once dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about
 62633	the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress.
 62634	
 62635	NatÃ¡sha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her mother,
 62636	her brother, SÃ³nya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her
 62637	tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning.
 62638	
 62639	âItâs all nonsense, all rubbishâthose discussions which lead to nothing
 62640	and all those idiotic societies!â NatÃ¡sha declared of the very affairs
 62641	in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.
 62642	
 62643	And she would go to the nursery to nurse PÃ©tya, her only boy. No one
 62644	else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this
 62645	little three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she was
 62646	conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little
 62647	nose. That creature said: âYou are angry, you are jealous, you would
 62648	like to pay him out, you are afraidâbut here am I! And I am he...â and
 62649	that was unanswerable. It was more than true.
 62650	
 62651	During that fortnight of anxiety NatÃ¡sha resorted to the baby for
 62652	comfort so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him and
 62653	he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was just
 62654	what she needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her
 62655	husband more easily.
 62656	
 62657	She was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierreâs sleigh was heard
 62658	at the front door, and the old nurseâknowing how to please her
 62659	mistressâentered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming
 62660	face.
 62661	
 62662	âHas he come?â NatÃ¡sha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest
 62663	she should rouse the dozing baby.
 62664	
 62665	âHeâs come, maâam,â whispered the nurse.
 62666	
 62667	The blood rushed to NatÃ¡shaâs face and her feet involuntarily moved, but
 62668	she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his eyes and
 62669	looked at her. âYouâre here?â he seemed to be saying, and again lazily
 62670	smacked his lips.
 62671	
 62672	Cautiously withdrawing her breast, NatÃ¡sha rocked him a little, handed
 62673	him to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door. But at the
 62674	door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in
 62675	her joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round. The nurse with
 62676	raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot.
 62677	
 62678	âGo, maâam! Donât worry, go!â she whispered, smiling, with the kind of
 62679	familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.
 62680	
 62681	NatÃ¡sha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.
 62682	
 62683	DenÃ­sov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his
 62684	pipe, now for the first time recognized the old NatÃ¡sha. A flood of
 62685	brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.
 62686	
 62687	âHeâs come!â she exclaimed as she ran past, and DenÃ­sov felt that he too
 62688	was delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had returned.
 62689	
 62690	On reaching the vestibule NatÃ¡sha saw a tall figure in a fur coat
 62691	unwinding his scarf. âItâs he! Itâs really he! He has come!â she said
 62692	to herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head to her
 62693	breast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face,
 62694	covered with hoarfrost. âYes, it is he, happy and contented....â
 62695	
 62696	Then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had
 62697	experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her
 62698	face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of
 62699	reproaches and angry words.
 62700	
 62701	âYes, itâs all very well for you. You are pleased, youâve had a good
 62702	time.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration
 62703	for the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... PÃ©tya was at
 62704	deathâs door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, enjoying...â
 62705	
 62706	Pierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come sooner; he
 62707	knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two;
 62708	above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy. He wanted
 62709	to smile but dared not even think of doing so. He made a piteous,
 62710	frightened face and bent down.
 62711	
 62712	âI could not, on my honor. But how is PÃ©tya?â
 62713	
 62714	âAll right now. Come along! I wonder youâre not ashamed! If only you
 62715	could see what I was like without you, how I suffered!â
 62716	
 62717	âYou are well?â
 62718	
 62719	âCome, come!â she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went to
 62720	their rooms.
 62721	
 62722	When Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the nursery
 62723	holding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right palm and
 62724	dandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the babyâs broad face
 62725	with its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since over and there
 62726	was bright, joyous sunshine on NatÃ¡shaâs face as she gazed tenderly at
 62727	her husband and child.
 62728	
 62729	âAnd have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?â she
 62730	asked.
 62731	
 62732	âYes, capitally.â
 62733	
 62734	âYou see, he holds it up.â (She meant the babyâs head.) âBut how he did
 62735	frighten me... Youâve seen the princess? Is it true sheâs in love with
 62736	that...â
 62737	
 62738	âYes, just fancy...â
 62739	
 62740	At that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the baby
 62741	on his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries. But
 62742	in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby
 62743	with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his
 62744	attention.
 62745	
 62746	âHow sweet!â said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the baby.
 62747	âNow, Nicholas,â she added, turning to her husband, âI canât understand
 62748	how it is you donât see the charm of these delicious marvels.â
 62749	
 62750	âI donât and canât,â replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby. âA
 62751	lump of flesh. Come along, Pierre!â
 62752	
 62753	âAnd yet heâs such an affectionate father,â said Countess Mary,
 62754	vindicating her husband, âbut only after they are a year old or so...â
 62755	
 62756	âNow, Pierre nurses them splendidly,â said NatÃ¡sha. âHe says his hand is
 62757	just made for a babyâs seat. Just look!â
 62758	
 62759	âOnly not for this...â Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and
 62760	shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.
 62761	
 62762	
 62763	
 62764	
 62765	
 62766	CHAPTER XII
 62767	
 62768	As in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several perfectly
 62769	distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole, though each
 62770	retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others. Every
 62771	event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all
 62772	these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve
 62773	over that occurrence independently of the others.
 62774	
 62775	For instance, Pierreâs return was a joyful and important event and they
 62776	all felt it to be so.
 62777	
 62778	The servantsâthe most reliable judges of their masters because they
 62779	judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their
 62780	acts and way of lifeâwere glad of Pierreâs return because they knew that
 62781	when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend
 62782	to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also
 62783	because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays.
 62784	
 62785	The children and their governesses were glad of Pierreâs return because
 62786	no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did.
 62787	He alone could play on the clavichord that Ã©cossaise (his only piece)
 62788	to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt
 62789	sure he had brought presents for them all.
 62790	
 62791	Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent,
 62792	with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because
 62793	Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and
 62794	passionate affection. No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre
 62795	whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up
 62796	had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and
 62797	little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of
 62798	contempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or
 62799	a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned,
 62800	wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierreâs presence his face always shone
 62801	with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to
 62802	him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards,
 62803	with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of
 62804	everything Pierre had said. Pierreâs past life and his unhappiness prior
 62805	to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from
 62806	some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity,
 62807	PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for NatÃ¡sha
 62808	(of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierreâs
 62809	friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not rememberâall this
 62810	made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.
 62811	
 62812	From broken remarks about NatÃ¡sha and his father, from the emotion with
 62813	which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent
 62814	tenderness with which NatÃ¡sha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just
 62815	beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had
 62816	loved NatÃ¡sha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father
 62817	whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not
 62818	be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and
 62819	tears of sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had
 62820	arrived.
 62821	
 62822	The guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite
 62823	any company he was in.
 62824	
 62825	The grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were
 62826	pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly
 62827	and peacefully.
 62828	
 62829	The old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and
 62830	especially that NatÃ¡sha would now be herself again.
 62831	
 62832	Pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made
 62833	haste to satisfy all their expectations.
 62834	
 62835	Though the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid
 62836	of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting
 62837	his motherâand brother-in-lawâs commissions, nor the dress material for
 62838	a present to BelÃ³va, nor toys for his wifeâs nephews. In the early days
 62839	of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect
 62840	him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he
 62841	had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he
 62842	forgot everything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that
 62843	NatÃ¡sha asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others
 62844	only when he himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an
 62845	unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for
 62846	everyone in the house, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred
 62847	NatÃ¡shaâs censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive
 62848	things. To her other defects (as most people thought them, but which
 62849	to Pierre were qualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now
 62850	added stinginess.
 62851	
 62852	From the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing
 62853	entailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he
 62854	spent only half as much as before, and that his affairsâwhich had been
 62855	in disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wifeâs debtsâhad begun
 62856	to improve.
 62857	
 62858	Life was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive
 62859	luxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no
 62860	longer his nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had now
 62861	been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in
 62862	his power, and so that way of life proved economical.
 62863	
 62864	With a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.
 62865	
 62866	âWhat do you think of this?â said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a
 62867	shopman.
 62868	
 62869	NatÃ¡sha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her
 62870	lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he
 62871	showed her.
 62872	
 62873	âThatâs for BelÃ³va? Excellent!â She felt the quality of the material.
 62874	âIt was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?â
 62875	
 62876	Pierre told her the price.
 62877	
 62878	âToo dear!â NatÃ¡sha remarked. âHow pleased the children will be and
 62879	Mamma too! Only you need not have bought me this,â she added, unable to
 62880	suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls,
 62881	of a kind then just coming into fashion.
 62882	
 62883	âAdÃ¨le tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it,â returned Pierre.
 62884	
 62885	âWhen am I to wear it?â and NatÃ¡sha stuck it in her coil of hair. âWhen
 62886	I take little MÃ¡sha into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable again
 62887	by then. Well, letâs go now.â
 62888	
 62889	And collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to
 62890	the old countessâ rooms.
 62891	
 62892	The countess was sitting with her companion BelÃ³va, playing
 62893	grand-patience as usual, when Pierre and NatÃ¡sha came into the drawing
 62894	room with parcels under their arms.
 62895	
 62896	The countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a
 62897	frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip
 62898	had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.
 62899	
 62900	After the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she
 62901	felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
 62902	without aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept
 62903	awake, but did not live. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted
 62904	nothing from life but tranquillity, and that tranquillity only death
 62905	could give her. But until death came she had to go on living, that is,
 62906	to use her vital forces. A peculiarity one sees in very young children
 62907	and very old people was particularly evident in her. Her life had
 62908	no external aimsâonly a need to exercise her various functions and
 62909	inclinations was apparent. She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep,
 62910	work, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely because she had a
 62911	stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a liver. She did these things not
 62912	under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do,
 62913	when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their
 62914	functions remains unnoticed. She talked only because she physically
 62915	needed to exercise her tongue and lungs. She cried as a child does,
 62916	because her nose had to be cleared, and so on. What for people in their
 62917	full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext.
 62918	
 62919	Thus in the morningâespecially if she had eaten anything rich the day
 62920	beforeâshe felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest
 62921	pretext BelÃ³vaâs deafness.
 62922	
 62923	She would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end
 62924	of the room.
 62925	
 62926	âIt seems a little warmer today, my dear,â she would murmur.
 62927	
 62928	And when BelÃ³va replied: âOh yes, theyâve come,â she would mutter
 62929	angrily: âO Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!â
 62930	
 62931	Another pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp
 62932	or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face
 62933	would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when BelÃ³va
 62934	would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countessâ face yellow. Just
 62935	as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise
 62936	her still-existing faculty of thinkingâand the pretext for that was a
 62937	game of patience. When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be
 62938	the pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health
 62939	would be the pretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the
 62940	pretext would be Countess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise,
 62941	which was usually toward seven oâclock when she had had an after-dinner
 62942	rest in a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same
 62943	stories over and over again to the same audience.
 62944	
 62945	The old ladyâs condition was understood by the whole household though no
 62946	one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible effort to satisfy
 62947	her needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile
 62948	between Nicholas, Pierre, NatÃ¡sha, and Countess Mary was the common
 62949	understanding of her condition expressed.
 62950	
 62951	But those glances expressed something more: they said that she had
 62952	played her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self,
 62953	that we must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to
 62954	her, to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as
 62955	full of life as themselves, but now so much to be pitied. âMemento
 62956	mori,â said these glances.
 62957	
 62958	Only the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the
 62959	little children failed to understand this and avoided her.

 62965	CHAPTER XIII
 62966	
 62967	When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in
 62968	one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of
 62969	playing patience, and soâthough by force of habit she greeted him with
 62970	the words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an
 62971	absence: âHigh time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting
 62972	for you. Well, thank God!â and received her presents with another
 62973	customary remark: âItâs not the gift thatâs precious, my dear, but that
 62974	you give it to me, an old woman...ââyet it was evident that she was
 62975	not pleased by Pierreâs arrival at that moment when it diverted her
 62976	attention from the unfinished game.
 62977	
 62978	She finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents.
 62979	They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a
 62980	bright-blue SÃ¨vres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with
 62981	a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the countâs portrait on the lid which
 62982	Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had
 62983	long wished for such a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she
 62984	glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to
 62985	the box for cards.
 62986	
 62987	âThank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,â said she as she always
 62988	did. âBut best of all you have brought yourself backâfor I never saw
 62989	anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we
 62990	to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away. Doesnât see
 62991	anything, doesnât remember anything,â she went on, repeating her usual
 62992	phrases. âLook, Anna TimofÃ©evna,â she added to her companion, âsee what
 62993	a box for cards my son has brought us!â
 62994	
 62995	BelÃ³va admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.
 62996	
 62997	Though Pierre, NatÃ¡sha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and DenÃ­sov had much to
 62998	talk about that they could not discuss before the old countessânot
 62999	that anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so
 63000	far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her
 63001	presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to
 63002	repeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was
 63003	dead and so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to
 63004	rememberâyet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from
 63005	habit, and Pierre answered the countessâ questions as to whether Prince
 63006	VasÃ­li had aged and whether Countess Mary AlexÃ©evna had sent greetings
 63007	and still thought of them, and other matters that interested no one and
 63008	to which she herself was indifferent.
 63009	
 63010	Conversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,
 63011	continued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the family
 63012	were assembled near the round tea table at which SÃ³nya presided beside
 63013	the samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had had
 63014	tea and their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all sat
 63015	in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table
 63016	where his tea was handed to him; MÃ­lka, the old gray borzoi bitch
 63017	(daughter of the first MÃ­lka), with a quite gray face and large black
 63018	eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside
 63019	him; DenÃ­sov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half
 63020	gray, sat beside countess Mary with his generalâs tunic unbuttoned;
 63021	Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess. He spoke of what he
 63022	knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand. He
 63023	told her of external social events and of the people who had formed
 63024	the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real, living, and
 63025	distinct group, but who were now for the most part scattered about the
 63026	world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they
 63027	had sown in earlier years. But to the old countess those contemporaries
 63028	of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society. NatÃ¡sha saw by
 63029	Pierreâs animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had
 63030	much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess. DenÃ­sov,
 63031	not being a member of the family, did not understand Pierreâs caution
 63032	and being, as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in
 63033	Petersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in
 63034	the SemÃ«novsk regiment, then about ArakchÃ©ev, and then about the Bible
 63035	Society. Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of
 63036	these things, but Nicholas and NatÃ¡sha always brought him back to the
 63037	health of Prince IvÃ¡n and Countess Mary AlexÃ©evna.
 63038	
 63039	âWell, and all this idiocyâGossner and TatÃ¡winova?â DenÃ­sov asked. âIs
 63040	that weally still going on?â
 63041	
 63042	âGoing on?â Pierre exclaimed. âWhy more than ever! The Bible Society is
 63043	the whole government now!â
 63044	
 63045	âWhat is that, mon cher ami?â asked the countess, who had finished her
 63046	tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal. âWhat
 63047	are you saying about the government? I donât understand.â
 63048	
 63049	âWell, you know, Maman,â Nicholas interposed, knowing how to translate
 63050	things into his motherâs language, âPrince Alexander GolÃ­tsyn has
 63051	founded a society and in consequence has great influence, they say.â
 63052	
 63053	âArakchÃ©ev and GolÃ­tsyn,â incautiously remarked Pierre, âare now the
 63054	whole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere and
 63055	are afraid of everything.â
 63056	
 63057	âWell, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most estimable
 63058	man. I used to meet him at Mary AntÃ³novnaâs,â said the countess in an
 63059	offended tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent,
 63060	she went on: âNowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and
 63061	what harm is there in that?â and she rose (everybody else got up too)
 63062	and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting
 63063	room.
 63064	
 63065	The melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the
 63066	childrenâs voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly
 63067	excitement was going on there.
 63068	
 63069	âFinished, finished!â little NatÃ¡shaâs gleeful yell rose above them all.
 63070	
 63071	Pierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (NatÃ¡sha he
 63072	never lost sight of) and smiled happily.
 63073	
 63074	âThatâs delightful music!â said he.
 63075	
 63076	âIt means that Anna MakÃ¡rovna has finished her stocking,â said Countess
 63077	Mary.
 63078	
 63079	âOh, Iâll go and see,â said Pierre, jumping up. âYou know,â he added,
 63080	stopping at the door, âwhy Iâm especially fond of that music? It is
 63081	always the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was driving
 63082	here today, the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I
 63083	entered the anteroom I heard AndrÃºshaâs peals of laughter and that meant
 63084	that all was well.â
 63085	
 63086	âI know! I know that feeling,â said Nicholas. âBut I mustnât go
 63087	thereâthose stockings are to be a surprise for me.â
 63088	
 63089	Pierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still
 63090	louder.
 63091	
 63092	âCome, Anna MakÃ¡rovna,â Pierreâs voice was heard saying, âcome here into
 63093	the middle of the room and at the word of command, âOne, two,â and
 63094	when I say âthreeâ... You stand here, and you in my armsâwell now! One,
 63095	two!...â said Pierre, and a silence followed: âthree!â and a rapturously
 63096	breathless cry of childrenâs voices filled the room. âTwo, two!â they
 63097	shouted.
 63098	
 63099	This meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to
 63100	herself Anna MakÃ¡rovna used to knit at the same time on the same
 63101	needles, and which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly drew,
 63102	one out of the other, in the childrenâs presence.
 63103	
 63104	
 63105	
 63106	
 63107	
 63108	CHAPTER XIV
 63109	
 63110	Soon after this the children came in to say good night. They kissed
 63111	everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out.
 63112	Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the
 63113	boy to come downstairs.
 63114	
 63115	âNo, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,â replied
 63116	Nicholas BolkÃ³nski also in a whisper.
 63117	
 63118	âMa tante, please let me stay,â said he, going up to his aunt.
 63119	
 63120	His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary
 63121	glanced at him and turned to Pierre.
 63122	
 63123	âWhen you are here he canât tear himself away,â she said.
 63124	
 63125	âI will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good night!â
 63126	said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young
 63127	Nicholas with a smile. âYou and I havenât seen anything of one another
 63128	yet.... How like he is growing, Mary!â he added, addressing Countess
 63129	Mary.
 63130	
 63131	âLike my father?â asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up at
 63132	Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.
 63133	
 63134	Pierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the
 63135	children had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork; NatÃ¡sha
 63136	did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and DenÃ­sov rose, asked
 63137	for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from SÃ³nyaâwho sat weary
 63138	but resolute at the samovarâand questioned Pierre. The curly-headed,
 63139	delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner, starting
 63140	every now and then and muttering something to himself, and evidently
 63141	experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head,
 63142	with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, toward the place
 63143	where Pierre sat.
 63144	
 63145	The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power,
 63146	in which most people see the chief interest of home politics. DenÃ­sov,
 63147	dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments
 63148	in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg
 63149	which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what
 63150	Pierre told them.
 63151	
 63152	âOne used to have to be a Germanânow one must dance with TatÃ¡winova
 63153	and Madame KwÃ¼dener, and wead Eckaâtshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they
 63154	should let that fine fellow Bonaparte looseâheâd knock all this nonsense
 63155	out of them! Fancy giving the command of the SemÃ«nov wegiment to a
 63156	fellow like that Schwaâtz!â he cried.
 63157	
 63158	Nicholas, though free from DenÃ­sovâs readiness to find fault with
 63159	everything, also thought that discussion of the government was a very
 63160	serious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been appointed
 63161	Minister of This and B Governor General of That, and that the Emperor
 63162	had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very
 63163	important. And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these
 63164	things and to question Pierre. The questions put by these two kept the
 63165	conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the
 63166	higher government circles.
 63167	
 63168	But NatÃ¡sha, knowing all her husbandâs ways and ideas, saw that he had
 63169	long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to
 63170	another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of
 63171	which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince
 63172	Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince
 63173	Theodore had gone.
 63174	
 63175	âWhat was it about?â asked Nicholas.
 63176	
 63177	âAlways the same thing,â said Pierre, looking round at his listeners.
 63178	âEverybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be
 63179	allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to
 63180	counteract it as far as they can.â
 63181	
 63182	âWhat can decent men do?â Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. âWhat
 63183	can be done?â
 63184	
 63185	âWhy, this...â
 63186	
 63187	âCome into my study,â said Nicholas.
 63188	
 63189	NatÃ¡sha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now
 63190	heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary
 63191	followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas BolkÃ³nski
 63192	followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table
 63193	in a shady corner by the window.
 63194	
 63195	âWell, what would you do?â asked DenÃ­sov.
 63196	
 63197	âAlways some fantastic schemes,â said Nicholas.
 63198	
 63199	âWhy this,â began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,
 63200	sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: âthe position
 63201	in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He
 63202	has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticismâ (Pierre could not
 63203	tolerate mysticism in anyone now). âHe seeks only for peace, and only
 63204	these people sans foi ni loi * can give it himâpeople who recklessly
 63205	hack at and strangle everythingâMagnÃ­tski, ArakchÃ©ev, and tutti
 63206	quanti.... You will agree that if you did not look after your estates
 63207	yourself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your steward was the
 63208	more readily your object might be attained,â he said to Nicholas.
 63209	
 63210	    * Without faith or law.
 63211	
 63212	âWell, what does that lead up to?â said Nicholas.
 63213	
 63214	âWell, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in the
 63215	army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the
 63216	people are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and
 63217	honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is
 63218	strained to such a degree that it will certainly break,â said Pierre (as
 63219	those who examine the actions of any government have always said since
 63220	governments began). âI told them just one thing in Petersburg.â
 63221	
 63222	âTold whom?â
 63223	
 63224	âWell, you know whom,â said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under
 63225	his brows. âPrince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and
 63226	philanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the
 63227	present circumstances something else is needed.â
 63228	
 63229	At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face
 63230	darkened and he went up to the boy.
 63231	
 63232	âWhy are you here?â
 63233	
 63234	âWhy? Let him be,â said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and
 63235	continuing. âThat is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed.
 63236	When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment,
 63237	when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as
 63238	possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general
 63239	calamity. Everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and
 63240	depraved. One is lured by women, another by honors, a third by ambition
 63241	or money, and they go over to that camp. No independent men, such as you
 63242	or I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the
 63243	mot dâordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well!â
 63244	
 63245	Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat
 63246	down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning
 63247	more and more.
 63248	
 63249	âBut action with what aim?â he cried. âAnd what position will you adopt
 63250	toward the government?â
 63251	
 63252	âWhy, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the
 63253	government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but
 63254	it is a society of true conservativesâa society of gentlemen in the full
 63255	meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some PugachÃ«v or other from
 63256	killing my children and yours, and ArakchÃ©ev from sending me off to some
 63257	Military Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the
 63258	general safety.â
 63259	
 63260	âYes, but itâs a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one
 63261	which can only cause harm.â
 63262	
 63263	âWhy? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europeâ (they did not then venture
 63264	to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) âdo any harm? The Tugendbund
 63265	is an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ
 63266	preached on the Cross.â
 63267	
 63268	NatÃ¡sha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at
 63269	her husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased herâthat did not
 63270	even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple
 63271	and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she
 63272	knew that it sprang from Pierreâs whole soul), but it was his animated
 63273	and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.
 63274	
 63275	The boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down collarâwhom
 63276	everyone had forgottenâgazed at Pierre with even greater and more
 63277	rapturous joy. Every word of Pierreâs burned into his heart, and with a
 63278	nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax
 63279	and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncleâs table.
 63280	
 63281	âIt is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German
 63282	Tugendbund was, and what I am proposing.â
 63283	
 63284	âNo, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters,
 63285	but I donât understand it and canât even pwonounce it,â interposed
 63286	DenÃ­sov in a loud and resolute voice. âI agwee that evewything here is
 63287	wotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund I donât understand. If weâre
 63288	not satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own. Thatâs all wight. Je suis
 63289	votâe homme!â *
 63290	
 63291	    * âIâm your man.â
 63292	
 63293	
 63294	Pierre smiled, NatÃ¡sha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his brows
 63295	still more and began proving to Pierre that there was no prospect of
 63296	any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his
 63297	imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties
 63298	were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This
 63299	made him still angrier, for he was fully convinced, not by reasoning
 63300	but by something within him stronger than reason, of the justice of his
 63301	opinion.
 63302	
 63303	âI will tell you this,â he said, rising and trying with nervously
 63304	twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally
 63305	abandoning the attempt. âI canât prove it to you. You say that
 63306	everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I donât
 63307	see it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional
 63308	matter, and to that I reply: âYou are my best friend, as you know,
 63309	but if you formed a secret society and began working against the
 63310	governmentâbe it what it mayâI know it is my duty to obey the
 63311	government. And if ArakchÃ©ev ordered me to lead a squadron against you
 63312	and cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.â
 63313	And you may argue about that as you like!â
 63314	
 63315	An awkward silence followed these words. NatÃ¡sha was the first to speak,
 63316	defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense was weak
 63317	and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was resumed, and
 63318	no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholasâ last remark.
 63319	
 63320	When they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas BolkÃ³nski went
 63321	up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.
 63322	
 63323	âUncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree with
 63324	you?â he asked.
 63325	
 63326	And Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex, and
 63327	powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in
 63328	this boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said he
 63329	regretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to give
 63330	him an answer.
 63331	
 63332	âYes, I think so,â he said reluctantly, and left the study.
 63333	
 63334	The lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he
 63335	had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to Nicholas.
 63336	
 63337	âUncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,â he said, pointing to
 63338	the broken sealing wax and pens.
 63339	
 63340	Nicholas started angrily.
 63341	
 63342	âAll right, all right,â he said, throwing the bits under the table.
 63343	
 63344	And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned away
 63345	from the boy.
 63346	
 63347	âYou ought not to have been here at all,â he said.
 63348	
 63349	
 63350	
 63351	
 63352	
 63353	CHAPTER XV
 63354	
 63355	The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, but
 63356	turned on the subject Nicholas liked bestârecollections of 1812. DenÃ­sov
 63357	started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about
 63358	them. The family separated on the most friendly terms.
 63359	
 63360	After supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given
 63361	instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to the
 63362	bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her
 63363	table, writing.
 63364	
 63365	âWhat are you writing, Mary?â Nicholas asked.
 63366	
 63367	Countess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing would
 63368	not be understood or approved by her husband.
 63369	
 63370	She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at the same
 63371	time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to
 63372	tell him.
 63373	
 63374	âA diary, Nicholas,â she replied, handing him a blue exercise book
 63375	filled with her firm, bold writing.
 63376	
 63377	âA diary?â Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up the
 63378	book.
 63379	
 63380	It was in French.
 63381	
 63382	
 63383	December 4. Today when AndrÃºsha (her eldest boy) woke up he did not
 63384	wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty and
 63385	obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. Then I took the
 63386	matter in hand: I left him alone and began with nurseâs help to get the
 63387	other children up, telling him that I did not love him. For a long time
 63388	he was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in
 63389	his shirt, and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time.
 63390	It was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me.
 63391	Afterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began
 63392	crying piteously and kissing me. One can do anything with him by
 63393	tenderness.
 63394	
 63395	
 63396	âWhat is a âticketâ?â Nicholas inquired.
 63397	
 63398	âI have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how
 63399	they have behaved.â
 63400	
 63401	Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and
 63402	continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down
 63403	everything in the childrenâs lives that seemed noteworthy to their
 63404	mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections
 63405	on educational methods. They were for the most part quite insignificant
 63406	trifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either, now
 63407	that he read this diary about his children for the first time.
 63408	
 63409	Under the date â5â was entered:
 63410	
 63411	
 63412	MÃ­tya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding. He had
 63413	none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were
 63414	eating! I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only
 63415	develops their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this.
 63416	
 63417	Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant eyes
 63418	gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her
 63419	diary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his
 63420	admiration for his wife.
 63421	
 63422	Perhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even
 63423	done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the
 63424	sole aim was the childrenâs moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas
 63425	been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady,
 63426	tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at
 63427	her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach,
 63428	in which she had her being.
 63429	
 63430	He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own
 63431	insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the
 63432	more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of
 63433	himself.
 63434	
 63435	âI quite, quite approve, my dearest!â said he with a significant look,
 63436	and after a short pause he added: âAnd I behaved badly today. You
 63437	werenât in the study. We began disputingâPierre and Iâand I lost my
 63438	temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I donât know what would
 63439	become of him if NatÃ¡sha didnât keep him in hand.... Have you any idea
 63440	why he went to Petersburg? They have formed...â
 63441	
 63442	âYes, I know,â said Countess Mary. âNatÃ¡sha told me.â
 63443	
 63444	âWell, then, you know,â Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere
 63445	recollection of their discussion, âhe wanted to convince me that it is
 63446	every honest manâs duty to go against the government, and that the oath
 63447	of allegiance and duty... I am sorry you werenât there. They all fell on
 63448	meâDenÃ­sov and NatÃ¡sha... NatÃ¡sha is absurd. How she rules over him! And
 63449	yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own
 63450	but only repeats his sayings...â added Nicholas, yielding to that
 63451	irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and
 63452	dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying about NatÃ¡sha could
 63453	have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife.
 63454	
 63455	âYes, I have noticed that,â said Countess Mary.
 63456	
 63457	âWhen I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he
 63458	started proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not thereâwhat
 63459	would you have said?â
 63460	
 63461	âAs I see it you were quite right, and I told NatÃ¡sha so. Pierre says
 63462	everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that it
 63463	is our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there,â said
 63464	Countess Mary, âbut he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us,
 63465	duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose
 63466	ourselves to risks we must not risk our children.â
 63467	
 63468	âYes, thatâs it! Thatâs just what I said to him,â put in Nicholas, who
 63469	fancied he really had said it. âBut they insisted on their own view:
 63470	love of oneâs neighbor and Christianityâand all this in the presence of
 63471	young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.â
 63472	
 63473	âAh, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,â
 63474	said Countess Mary. âHe is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I
 63475	neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while
 63476	he has no one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts.â
 63477	
 63478	âWell, I donât think you need reproach yourself on his account. All that
 63479	the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for
 63480	him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This
 63481	evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancyâas we were
 63482	going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to
 63483	bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an
 63484	untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!â repeated Nicholas, who at heart was
 63485	not fond of Nicholas BolkÃ³nski but was always anxious to recognize that
 63486	he was a fine lad.
 63487	
 63488	âStill, I am not the same as his own mother,â said Countess Mary. âI
 63489	feel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am
 63490	dreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions.â
 63491	
 63492	âWell it wonât be for long. Next summer Iâll take him to Petersburg,â
 63493	said Nicholas. âYes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,â
 63494	he continued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently
 63495	disturbed him. âWell, what business is it of mine what goes on
 63496	thereâwhether ArakchÃ©ev is bad, and all that? What business was it of
 63497	mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with
 63498	prison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it? And
 63499	then there are you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own
 63500	pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?
 63501	No, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, and not
 63502	to leave the children such beggars as I was.â
 63503	
 63504	Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone
 63505	and that he attached too much importance to these matters. But she knew
 63506	she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only
 63507	took his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of approval and
 63508	a confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few minutesâ reflection
 63509	continued to think aloud.
 63510	
 63511	âYou know, Mary, today Elias MitrofÃ¡nychâ (this was his overseer) âcame
 63512	back from the TambÃ³v estate and told me they are already offering eighty
 63513	thousand rubles for the forest.â
 63514	
 63515	And with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of
 63516	repurchasing OtrÃ¡dnoe before long, and added: âAnother ten years of life
 63517	and I shall leave the children... in an excellent position.â
 63518	
 63519	Countess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told
 63520	her. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes
 63521	ask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he noticed that she
 63522	had been thinking about something else. But she had to force herself to
 63523	attend, for what he was saying did not interest her at all. She looked
 63524	at him and did not think, but felt, about something different. She felt
 63525	a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all
 63526	that she understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still
 63527	stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this
 63528	feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following
 63529	the details of her husbandâs plans, thoughts that had no connection with
 63530	what he was saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew.
 63531	Her husbandâs account of the boyâs agitation while Pierre was speaking
 63532	struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive
 63533	character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she
 63534	thought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but
 63535	compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt
 63536	with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young
 63537	Nicholas.
 63538	
 63539	Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the
 63540	difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and
 63541	promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossibleâin
 63542	this life to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all
 63543	her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Maryâs soul always
 63544	strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could
 63545	therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret
 63546	suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas
 63547	gazed at her. âO God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always
 63548	fear when her face is like that?â thought he, and placing himself before
 63549	the icon he began to say his evening prayers.
 63550	
 63551	
 63552	
 63553	
 63554	
 63555	CHAPTER XVI
 63556	
 63557	NatÃ¡sha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband
 63558	and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity,
 63559	understanding and expressing each otherâs thoughts in ways contrary to
 63560	all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in
 63561	a quite peculiar way. NatÃ¡sha was so used to this kind of talk with her
 63562	husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong
 63563	between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning. When he
 63564	began proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly and she,
 63565	led on by his example, began to do the same, she knew that they were on
 63566	the verge of a quarrel.
 63567	
 63568	From the moment they were alone and NatÃ¡sha came up to him with
 63569	wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her
 63570	bosom, saying: âNow you are all mine, mine! You wonât escape!ââfrom that
 63571	moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and
 63572	contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at
 63573	one and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics did
 63574	not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest
 63575	sign that they fully understood one another.
 63576	
 63577	Just as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and
 63578	contradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this
 63579	intercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves were
 63580	not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them.
 63581	
 63582	NatÃ¡sha spoke to Pierre about her brotherâs life and doings, of how she
 63583	had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of how she
 63584	was fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way better than
 63585	herself. In saying this NatÃ¡sha was sincere in acknowledging Maryâs
 63586	superiority, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on
 63587	Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all
 63588	other women, and that now, especially after having seen many women in
 63589	Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.
 63590	
 63591	Pierre, answering NatÃ¡shaâs words, told her how intolerable it had been
 63592	for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.
 63593	
 63594	âI have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,â he said. âIt was
 63595	simply dull. Besides, I was very busy.â
 63596	
 63597	NatÃ¡sha looked intently at him and went on:
 63598	
 63599	âMary is so splendid,â she said. âHow she understands children! It is as
 63600	if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance, MÃ­tya was
 63601	naughty...â
 63602	
 63603	âHow like his father he is,â Pierre interjected.
 63604	
 63605	NatÃ¡sha knew why he mentioned MÃ­tyaâs likeness to Nicholas: the
 63606	recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and
 63607	he wanted to know what NatÃ¡sha thought of it.
 63608	
 63609	âNicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally
 63610	accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line,â
 63611	said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.
 63612	
 63613	âNo, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are
 63614	an amusementâalmost a pastime,â said Pierre. âFor instance, he is
 63615	collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book
 63616	till he has read what he had already boughtâSismondi and Rousseau and
 63617	Montesquieu,â he added with a smile. âYou know how much I...â he began
 63618	to soften down what he had said; but NatÃ¡sha interrupted him to show
 63619	that this was unnecessary.
 63620	
 63621	âSo you say ideas are an amusement to him....â
 63622	
 63623	âYes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg I
 63624	saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is
 63625	mere amusement.â
 63626	
 63627	âAh, Iâm so sorry I wasnât there when you met the children,â said
 63628	NatÃ¡sha. âWhich was most delighted? Lisa, Iâm sure.â
 63629	
 63630	âYes,â Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind. âNicholas
 63631	says we ought not to think. But I canât help it. Besides, when I was in
 63632	Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go
 63633	to pieces without meâeveryone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded
 63634	in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear and simple. You see,
 63635	I donât say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be mistaken.
 63636	What I say is: âJoin hands, you who love the right, and let there be but
 63637	one bannerâthat of active virtue.â Prince SergÃ©y is a fine fellow and
 63638	clever.â
 63639	
 63640	NatÃ¡sha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierreâs idea,
 63641	but one thing disconcerted her. âCan a man so important and necessary to
 63642	society be also my husband? How did this happen?â She wished to express
 63643	this doubt to him. âNow who could decide whether he is really cleverer
 63644	than all the others?â she asked herself, and passed in review all those
 63645	whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one
 63646	he had respected so highly as PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev.
 63647	
 63648	âDo you know what I am thinking about?â she asked. âAbout PlatÃ³n
 63649	KaratÃ¡ev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?â
 63650	
 63651	Pierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood his
 63652	wifeâs line of thought.
 63653	
 63654	âPlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev?â he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely
 63655	trying to imagine KaratÃ¡evâs opinion on the subject. âHe would not have
 63656	understood... yet perhaps he would.â
 63657	
 63658	âI love you awfully!â NatÃ¡sha suddenly said. âAwfully, awfully!â
 63659	
 63660	âNo, he would not have approved,â said Pierre, after reflection. âWhat
 63661	he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious
 63662	to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should
 63663	have been proud to let him see us. There nowâyou talk of my absence,
 63664	but you wouldnât believe what a special feeling I have for you after a
 63665	separation....â
 63666	
 63667	âYes, I should think...â NatÃ¡sha began.
 63668	
 63669	âNo, itâs not that. I never leave off loving you. And one couldnât love
 63670	more, but this is something special.... Yes, of courseââ he did not
 63671	finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.
 63672	
 63673	âWhat nonsense it is,â NatÃ¡sha suddenly exclaimed, âabout honeymoons,
 63674	and that the greatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, now is
 63675	the best of all. If only you did not go away! Do you remember how
 63676	we quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we
 63677	quarreled aboutâI donât even remember!â
 63678	
 63679	âAlways about the same thing,â said Pierre with a smile. âJealo...â
 63680	
 63681	âDonât say it! I canât bear it!â NatÃ¡sha cried, and her eyes glittered
 63682	coldly and vindictively. âDid you see her?â she added, after a pause.
 63683	
 63684	âNo, and if I had I shouldnât have recognized her.â
 63685	
 63686	They were silent for a while.
 63687	
 63688	âOh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at
 63689	you,â NatÃ¡sha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had
 63690	come over them. âYou are as like him as two peasâlike the boy.â (She
 63691	meant her little son.) âOh, itâs time to go to him.... The milkâs
 63692	come.... But Iâm sorry to leave you.â
 63693	
 63694	They were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one
 63695	another at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with
 63696	self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, NatÃ¡sha with a quiet, happy smile.
 63697	Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other
 63698	continue.
 63699	
 63700	âNo. What did you say? Go on, go on.â
 63701	
 63702	âNo, you go on, I was talking nonsense,â said NatÃ¡sha.
 63703	
 63704	Pierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his complacent
 63705	reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed to
 63706	him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of Russian
 63707	society and to the whole world.
 63708	
 63709	âI only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always
 63710	simple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united and
 63711	constitute a power, then honest folk must do the same. Now thatâs simple
 63712	enough.â
 63713	
 63714	âYes.â
 63715	
 63716	âAnd what were you going to say?â
 63717	
 63718	âI? Only nonsense.â
 63719	
 63720	âBut all the same?â
 63721	
 63722	âOh nothing, only a trifle,â said NatÃ¡sha, smiling still more brightly.
 63723	âI only wanted to tell you about PÃ©tya: today nurse was coming to take
 63724	him from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me. Iâm sure
 63725	he thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now heâs crying. Well,
 63726	good-by!â and she left the room.
 63727	
 63728	
 63729	Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas BolkÃ³nskiâs bedroom a little lamp
 63730	was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark and they could
 63731	not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his
 63732	Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring. Little Nicholas, who had
 63733	just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him
 63734	with wide-open eyes. He had awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed
 63735	that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in
 63736	his Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white
 63737	slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in
 63738	autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la ViÃ¨rge. In front was
 63739	Glory, which was similar to those threads but rather thicker. He and
 63740	Pierre were borne along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their
 63741	goal. Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become
 63742	entangled and it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before
 63743	them in a stern and threatening attitude.
 63744	
 63745	âHave you done this?â he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and
 63746	pens. âI loved you, but I have orders from ArakchÃ©ev and will kill
 63747	the first of you who moves forward.â Little Nicholas turned to look
 63748	at Pierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his
 63749	fatherâPrince Andrewâand his father had neither shape nor form, but he
 63750	existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love:
 63751	he felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father caressed and
 63752	pitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror
 63753	seized young Nicholas and he awoke.
 63754	
 63755	âMy father!â he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince
 63756	Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) âMy
 63757	father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle
 63758	Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned
 63759	his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know
 63760	they want me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have
 63761	finished learning, and then I will do something. I only pray God that
 63762	something may happen to me such as happened to Plutarchâs men, and I
 63763	will act as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me,
 63764	and be delighted with me!â And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and
 63765	he began to cry.
 63766	
 63767	âAre you ill?â he heard Dessallesâ voice asking.
 63768	
 63769	âNo,â answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.
 63770	
 63771	âHe is good and kind and I am fond of him!â he thought of Dessalles.
 63772	âBut Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father? Oh,
 63773	Father, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he would be
 63774	satisfied....â
 63775

 63780	SECOND EPILOGUE
 63781	
 63782	
 63783	
 63784	
 63785	
 63786	CHAPTER I
 63787	
 63788	History is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize and put into
 63789	words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single
 63790	nation, appears impossible.
 63791	
 63792	The ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe
 63793	and seize the apparently elusiveâthe life of a people. They described
 63794	the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the
 63795	activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation.
 63796	
 63797	The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by
 63798	what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients
 63799	met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of
 63800	a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish
 63801	ends that were predestined.
 63802	
 63803	For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct
 63804	participation of the Deity in human affairs.
 63805	
 63806	Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.
 63807	
 63808	It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in manâs
 63809	subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations
 63810	are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but
 63811	the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having
 63812	in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them
 63813	in practice.
 63814	
 63815	Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by
 63816	the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with
 63817	extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various
 63818	kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the
 63819	former divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations,
 63820	which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of
 63821	humanity, modern history has postulated its own aimsâthe welfare of the
 63822	French, German, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the
 63823	welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually
 63824	meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a
 63825	large continent.
 63826	
 63827	Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without
 63828	replacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has
 63829	obliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the divine
 63830	authority of the kings and the âfateâ of the ancients, to reach the same
 63831	conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided
 63832	by individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these
 63833	nations and humanity at large are tending.
 63834	
 63835	At the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to
 63836	Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of
 63837	their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.
 63838	
 63839	In the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals
 63840	who in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian considers
 63841	only monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men, while another
 63842	includes also orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets).
 63843	Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led
 63844	is known to the historians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of
 63845	the Roman, Spanish, or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality,
 63846	and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called
 63847	Europe.
 63848	
 63849	In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed
 63850	by a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it moves
 63851	eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward.
 63852	In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with remarkable
 63853	symmetry, a countermovement occurs from east to west, attracting to
 63854	it, as the first movement had done, the nations of middle Europe. The
 63855	counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the
 63856	westâParisâand subsides.
 63857	
 63858	During that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left
 63859	untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions
 63860	of men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions
 63861	of Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one
 63862	another.
 63863	
 63864	What does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people burn
 63865	houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these events?
 63866	What force made men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and
 63867	most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the
 63868	monuments and tradition of that period.
 63869	
 63870	For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the
 63871	science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know
 63872	themselves.
 63873	
 63874	If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
 63875	said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and
 63876	directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply
 63877	would have been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve
 63878	in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in
 63879	it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that
 63880	period, nor would there have been any contradictions.
 63881	
 63882	But modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the
 63883	conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity
 63884	in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers.
 63885	
 63886	Modern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what
 63887	this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these
 63888	events? Then listen:
 63889	
 63890	âLouis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such
 63891	mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly. His
 63892	descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly. And they had
 63893	such and such favorites and such and such mistresses. Moreover, certain
 63894	men wrote some books at that time. At the end of the eighteenth century
 63895	there were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all
 63896	men being free and equal. This caused people all over France to begin
 63897	to slash at and drown one another. They killed the king and many other
 63898	people. At that time there was in France a man of geniusâNapoleon. He
 63899	conquered everybody everywhereâthat is, he killed many people because
 63900	he was a great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and
 63901	killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to
 63902	France he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. Having
 63903	become an Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, Austria,
 63904	and Prussia. And there too he killed a great many. In Russia there
 63905	was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and
 63906	therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends
 63907	with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many
 63908	people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured
 63909	Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor
 63910	Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to
 63911	arm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleonâs allies suddenly
 63912	became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he
 63913	raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to
 63914	abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the
 63915	title of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before
 63916	and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand.
 63917	Then Louis XVIII, who till then had been the laughingstock both of the
 63918	French and the Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears
 63919	before his Old Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then
 63920	the skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who
 63921	managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and
 63922	thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by
 63923	these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the
 63924	diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of
 63925	again ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon
 63926	arrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating
 63927	him, immediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were
 63928	angry at this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated
 63929	the genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him
 63930	to the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved
 63931	France so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and
 63932	bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction
 63933	occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their
 63934	subjects.â
 63935	
 63936	It would be a mistake to think that this is ironicâa caricature of the
 63937	historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of
 63938	the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, which all the
 63939	historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories
 63940	of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new
 63941	histories of the culture of that period.
 63942	
 63943	The strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that
 63944	modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.
 63945	
 63946	If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of
 63947	humanity and of the peoples, the first questionâin the absence of a
 63948	reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensibleâis: what is the
 63949	power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies
 63950	either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very
 63951	proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.
 63952	
 63953	All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not
 63954	what was asked. All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine
 63955	power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations
 63956	through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such
 63957	a power, and therefore before speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and
 63958	authors, we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men
 63959	and the movement of the nations.
 63960	
 63961	If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it should
 63962	be explained in what this new force consists, for the whole interest of
 63963	history lies precisely in that force.
 63964	
 63965	History seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to
 63966	everyone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone
 63967	reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new
 63968	force, so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really
 63969	quite well known to everybody.
 63970	
 63971	
 63972	
 63973	
 63974	
 63975	CHAPTER II
 63976	
 63977	What force moves the nations?
 63978	
 63979	Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand
 63980	this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration
 63981	events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in
 63982	general of the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind
 63983	of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are
 63984	satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event.
 63985	As soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin
 63986	to describe the same event, the replies they give immediately lose all
 63987	meaning, for this force is understood by them all not only differently
 63988	but often in quite contradictory ways. One historian says that an
 63989	event was produced by Napoleonâs power, another that it was produced by
 63990	Alexanderâs, a third that it was due to the power of some other person.
 63991	Besides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even
 63992	in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some
 63993	particular person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleonâs
 63994	power was based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it
 63995	was based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians
 63996	of this class, by mutually destroying one anotherâs positions, destroy
 63997	the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no
 63998	reply to historyâs essential question.
 63999	
 64000	Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to
 64001	recognize how erroneous is the specialist historiansâ view of the force
 64002	which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in
 64003	heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously
 64004	directed forces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a people, a
 64005	general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power
 64006	of one man, but in the interaction of many persons connected with the
 64007	event.
 64008	
 64009	According to this view the power of historical personages, represented
 64010	as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded
 64011	as a force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal
 64012	historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself
 64013	produces events, and treat it as their cause. In their exposition, an
 64014	historic character is first the product of his time, and his power only
 64015	the resultant of various forces, and then his power is itself a force
 64016	producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one
 64017	time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of
 64018	1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812
 64019	and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleonâs
 64020	misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their
 64021	development by Napoleonâs caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the
 64022	general temper of the age produced Napoleonâs power. But Napoleonâs
 64023	power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of
 64024	the age.
 64025	
 64026	This curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at
 64027	every step, but the universal historiansâ accounts are all made up of
 64028	a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after
 64029	entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.
 64030	
 64031	To find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the
 64032	sum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never
 64033	observed by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant
 64034	forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient
 64035	components, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action.
 64036	
 64037	Specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration
 64038	of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the
 64039	will of Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this
 64040	opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of
 64041	1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside
 64042	Alexanderâs willâsuch as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de
 64043	StaÃ«l, Talleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian
 64044	evidently decomposes Alexanderâs power into the components: Talleyrand,
 64045	Chateaubriand, and the restâbut the sum of the components, that is,
 64046	the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de StaÃ«l, and the
 64047	others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon
 64048	of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand,
 64049	Madame de StaÃ«l, and others spoke certain words to one another only
 64050	affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission
 64051	of millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs
 64052	the submission of millions of people resultedâthat is, how component
 64053	forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times Aâthe
 64054	historian is again obliged to fall back on powerâthe force he had
 64055	deniedâand to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he
 64056	has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And that is
 64057	just what the universal historians do, and consequently they not only
 64058	contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.
 64059	
 64060	Peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to
 64061	whether they want rain or fine weather: âThe wind has blown the clouds
 64062	away,â or, âThe wind has brought up the clouds.â And in the same way the
 64063	universal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with
 64064	their theory, say that power is the result of events, and sometimes,
 64065	when they want to prove something else, say that power produces events.
 64066	
 64067	A third class of historiansâthe so-called historians of
 64068	cultureâfollowing the path laid down by the universal historians who
 64069	sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing eventsâagain
 64070	take that force to be something quite different. They see it in what is
 64071	called cultureâin mental activity.
 64072	
 64073	The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their
 64074	progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical
 64075	events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one
 64076	another in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that
 64077	such and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense number of
 64078	indications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select
 64079	the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is
 64080	the cause. But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events
 64081	lies in intellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit
 64082	that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the
 64083	movement of peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual
 64084	activity controls peopleâs actions, for that view is not confirmed by
 64085	such facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting
 64086	from the doctrine of the equality of man, or the very cruel wars and
 64087	executions resulting from the preaching of love.
 64088	
 64089	But even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with
 64090	which these histories are filledâadmitting that nations are governed by
 64091	some undefined force called an ideaâhistoryâs essential question still
 64092	remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the
 64093	influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal
 64094	historians, another, newer forceâthe ideaâis added, the connection of
 64095	which with the masses needs explanation. It is possible to understand
 64096	that Napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some effort one may
 64097	even conceive that Napoleon together with other influences was the cause
 64098	of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat Social, had the effect of making
 64099	Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an
 64100	explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event.
 64101	
 64102	Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously,
 64103	and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual
 64104	activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a
 64105	connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce,
 64106	handicraft, gardening, or anything else you please. But why intellectual
 64107	activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or
 64108	expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand.
 64109	Only the following considerations can have led the historians to such
 64110	a conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is
 64111	natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class
 64112	supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar
 64113	belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers
 64114	(if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and soldiers
 64115	do not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment,
 64116	civilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions
 64117	under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less
 64118	definite meaning, and which can therefore be readily introduced into any
 64119	theory.
 64120	
 64121	But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind
 64122	(which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the
 64123	histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more
 64124	to approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously
 64125	and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political
 64126	doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an
 64127	actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they
 64128	involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of powerâand say
 64129	plainly that that was the result of Napoleonâs will. Speaking so, the
 64130	historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that
 64131	the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in
 64132	history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power
 64133	which they apparently do not recognize.
 64134	
 64135	
 64136	
 64137	
 64138	
 64139	CHAPTER III
 64140	
 64141	A locomotive is moving. Someone asks: âWhat moves it?â A peasant says
 64142	the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its
 64143	wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in
 64144	the smoke which the wind carries away.
 64145	
 64146	The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To
 64147	refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil,
 64148	or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil
 64149	but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the
 64150	contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong. But the man who
 64151	says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself, for
 64152	having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why
 64153	the wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the
 64154	movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he
 64155	has no right to stop in his search for the cause. The man who explains
 64156	the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has
 64157	noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the
 64158	first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an
 64159	explanation.
 64160	
 64161	The only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is
 64162	that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.
 64163	
 64164	The only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that
 64165	of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples.
 64166	
 64167	Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
 64168	different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement
 64169	observed. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the
 64170	peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting
 64171	from several other forces, like the movement of the wheels; others again
 64172	as an intellectual influence, like the smoke that is blown away.
 64173	
 64174	So long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether
 64175	Caesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories
 64176	of all, absolutely all those who take part in an event, it is quite
 64177	impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception
 64178	of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end.
 64179	And the only such conception known to historians is that of power.
 64180	
 64181	This conception is the one handle by means of which the material of
 64182	history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who
 64183	breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method
 64184	of treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one
 64185	possible way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception of
 64186	power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by
 64187	the universal historians and historians of culture themselves, for they
 64188	professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at
 64189	every step.
 64190	
 64191	In dealing with humanityâs inquiry, the science of history up to now
 64192	is like money in circulationâpaper money and coin. The biographies and
 64193	special national histories are like paper money. They can be used and
 64194	can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even
 64195	advantageously, as long as no one asks what is the security behind them.
 64196	You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and
 64197	such histories as Thiersâ will be interesting and instructive and may
 64198	perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real
 64199	value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much
 64200	of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also
 64201	doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because
 64202	too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart
 64203	someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?âthat is, wants
 64204	to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual
 64205	comprehension.
 64206	
 64207	The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are
 64208	like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to
 64209	substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity
 64210	of gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more than
 64211	that. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is deceived by
 64212	tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle. As gold is
 64213	gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use,
 64214	so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to
 64215	historyâs essential question: what is power? The universal historians
 64216	give contradictory replies to that question, while the historians of
 64217	culture evade it and answer something quite different. And as counters
 64218	of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to
 64219	accept them as gold, or among those who do not know the nature of
 64220	gold, so universal historians and historians of culture, not answering
 64221	humanityâs essential question, serve as currency for some purposes of
 64222	their own, only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a
 64223	taste for what they call âserious reading.â
 64224	
 64225	
 64226	
 64227	
 64228	
 64229	CHAPTER IV
 64230	
 64231	Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine
 64232	subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection
 64233	of that manâs will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions
 64234	take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return
 64235	to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human
 64236	affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing
 64237	historical events and termed âpower.â
 64238	
 64239	A return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and
 64240	so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.
 64241	
 64242	Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so
 64243	accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question:
 64244	why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered
 64245	certain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he
 64246	ordered was done.
 64247	
 64248	This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given
 64249	him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to
 64250	determine what is this power of one man over others.
 64251	
 64252	It cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak oneâa
 64253	domination based on the application or threat of physical force, like
 64254	the power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force,
 64255	as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading
 64256	figures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted with a special
 64257	strength of soul and mind called genius. This power cannot be based on
 64258	the predominance of moral strength, for, not to mention heroes such as
 64259	Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely, history
 64260	shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over
 64261	millions of people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the
 64262	contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they
 64263	ruled over.
 64264	
 64265	If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
 64266	qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for
 64267	elsewhereâin the relation to the people of the man who wields the power.
 64268	
 64269	And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence,
 64270	that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historyâs
 64271	understanding of power for true gold.
 64272	
 64273	Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or
 64274	tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.
 64275	
 64276	In the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a
 64277	state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to
 64278	be arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that
 64279	definition of power needs explanation.
 64280	
 64281	The science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients
 64282	regarded fireânamely, as something existing absolutely. But for history,
 64283	the state and power are merely phenomena, just as for modern physics
 64284	fire is not an element but a phenomenon.
 64285	
 64286	From this fundamental difference between the view held by history and
 64287	that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell
 64288	minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what
 64289	powerâexisting immutably outside timeâis, but to historyâs questions
 64290	about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer
 64291	nothing.
 64292	
 64293	If power be the collective will of the people transferred to their
 64294	ruler, was PugachÃ«v a representative of the will of the people? If not,
 64295	then why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when he was
 64296	taken prisoner at Boulogne, and why, later on, were those criminals whom
 64297	he arrested?
 64298	
 64299	Do palace revolutionsâin which sometimes only two or three people take
 64300	partâtransfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In international
 64301	relations, is the will of the people also transferred to their
 64302	conqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred
 64303	to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people transferred
 64304	to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the French went to
 64305	fight the Austrians?
 64306	
 64307	To these questions three answers are possible:
 64308	
 64309	Either to assume (1) that the will of the people is always
 64310	unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and
 64311	that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle
 64312	against the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an
 64313	infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the people
 64314	is transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite and known
 64315	conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and even
 64316	destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the
 64317	conditions under which their power was entrusted to them; or (3) that
 64318	the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally, but
 64319	that the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and that the appearance
 64320	of several authorities, their struggles and their falls, result solely
 64321	from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown
 64322	conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some
 64323	people to others.
 64324	
 64325	And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the
 64326	relation of the people to their rulers.
 64327	
 64328	Some historiansâthose biographical and specialist historians already
 64329	referred toâin their simplicity failing to understand the question of
 64330	the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of
 64331	the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons, and
 64332	therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular
 64333	power to be the one absolute and real power, and that any other force
 64334	opposing this is not a power but a violation of powerâmere violence.
 64335	
 64336	Their theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history,
 64337	has the inconvenienceâin application to complex and stormy periods in
 64338	the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and
 64339	struggle with one anotherâthat a Legitimist historian will prove
 64340	that the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere
 64341	infringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will
 64342	prove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the
 64343	real power, and that all the others were violations of power.
 64344	Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually
 64345	contradictory can only satisfy young children.
 64346	
 64347	Recognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of
 64348	historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will
 64349	of the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have power
 64350	only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the
 64351	people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them. But what this program
 64352	consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they continually
 64353	contradict one another.
 64354	
 64355	Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nationâs
 64356	progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom,
 64357	or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not
 64358	to mention the historiansâ contradictions as to the nature of this
 64359	programâor even admitting that some one general program of these
 64360	conditions existsâthe facts of history almost always contradict that
 64361	theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the
 64362	wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis
 64363	XIV and IvÃ¡n the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI
 64364	and Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians
 64365	reply that Louis XIVâs activity, contrary to the program, reacted on
 64366	Louis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XVâwhy
 64367	should it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such
 64368	reactions? To these questions there are and can be no answers. Equally
 64369	little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective
 64370	will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and
 64371	then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the
 64372	Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII,
 64373	to Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican
 64374	government, and to Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers
 64375	of the peopleâs will from one individual to another, especially in view
 64376	of international relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are
 64377	obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations
 64378	of the peopleâs will but are accidents dependent on cunning, on
 64379	mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a ruler, or a
 64380	party leader. So that the greater part of the events of historyâcivil
 64381	wars, revolutions, and conquestsâare presented by these historians
 64382	not as the results of free transferences of the peopleâs will, but as
 64383	results of the ill-directed will of one or more individuals, that is,
 64384	once again, as usurpations of power. And so these historians also see
 64385	and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory.
 64386	
 64387	These historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some
 64388	plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all
 64389	that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the
 64390	mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer
 64391	resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.
 64392	
 64393	Historians of the third class assume that the will of the people
 64394	is transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the
 64395	conditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have
 64396	power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been
 64397	delegated to them.
 64398	
 64399	But in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the
 64400	historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have
 64401	those leaders?
 64402	
 64403	The leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people:
 64404	the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.
 64405	
 64406	But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
 64407	leaders serves as an expression of the peopleâs will or only some part
 64408	of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of
 64409	the peopleâs will, as some historians suppose, then all the details
 64410	of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or
 64411	a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident
 64412	nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an
 64413	historical leader which serves to express the peopleâs life, as other
 64414	so-called âphilosophicalâ historians believe, then to determine which
 64415	side of the activity of a leader expresses the nationâs life, we have
 64416	first of all to know in what the nationâs life consists.
 64417	
 64418	Met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most
 64419	obscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all
 64420	conceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of
 64421	humanityâs movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by almost
 64422	all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress,
 64423	civilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization as the goal
 64424	of the movement of humanity, the historians study the men of whom the
 64425	greatest number of monuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals,
 64426	authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to the extent to which in
 64427	their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction.
 64428	But as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in
 64429	freedom, equality, enlightenment, or civilization, and as the connection
 64430	of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based
 64431	on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is
 64432	always transferred to the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the
 64433	activity of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture,
 64434	and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the
 64435	activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses, practice
 64436	agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.
 64437	
 64438	History proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples of
 64439	the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward
 64440	explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their mistresses
 64441	and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Diderot,
 64442	Beaumarchais, and others?
 64443	
 64444	Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to KazÃ¡n and Siberia
 64445	expressed by details of the morbid character of IvÃ¡n the Terrible and by
 64446	his correspondence with KÃºrbski?
 64447	
 64448	Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by
 64449	the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies?
 64450	For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without
 64451	leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains
 64452	incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that
 64453	movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusadeâthe deliverance
 64454	of Jerusalemâhad been clearly defined by historic leaders. Popes, kings,
 64455	and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people
 64456	did not go, for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to
 64457	go no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers
 64458	can evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the history of the
 64459	Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys
 64460	and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the peoples and their
 64461	impulses has remained unknown.
 64462	
 64463	Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the
 64464	life of the peoples.
 64465	
 64466	The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of
 64467	life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had
 64468	a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was
 64469	suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after
 64470	the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the
 64471	French Revolution they guillotined one another.
 64472	
 64473	If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest
 64474	historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not
 64475	the history of the life of the peoples.
 64476	
 64477	
 64478	
 64479	
 64480	
 64481	CHAPTER V
 64482	
 64483	The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for
 64484	the connection between those men and the nations has not been found.
 64485	The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the
 64486	collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an
 64487	hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history.
 64488	
 64489	The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to
 64490	historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence
 64491	and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as
 64492	soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occurâthat is, as soon as
 64493	history beginsâthat theory explains nothing.
 64494	
 64495	The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the
 64496	peopleâs will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.
 64497	
 64498	Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the
 64499	theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because
 64500	the collective will was transferred to him.
 64501	
 64502	The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the
 64503	replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and
 64504	paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different
 64505	parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute
 64506	the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.
 64507	
 64508	âThe herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads
 64509	it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that
 64510	leader.â This is what historians of the first class sayâthose who assume
 64511	the unconditional transference of the peopleâs will.
 64512	
 64513	âIf the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the
 64514	collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to
 64515	another, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in
 64516	the direction selected by the whole herd.â Such is the reply historians
 64517	who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to
 64518	rulers under conditions which they regard as known. (With this method
 64519	of observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the
 64520	direction he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the
 64521	peopleâs change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side,
 64522	or even in the rear.)
 64523	
 64524	âIf the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of
 64525	the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow
 64526	a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that
 64527	have attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd
 64528	we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all
 64529	sides of the herd.â So say the third class of historians who regard all
 64530	historical persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of
 64531	their age.
 64532	
 64533	The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
 64534	persons is merely a paraphraseâa restatement of the question in other
 64535	words.
 64536	
 64537	What causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the
 64538	collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what
 64539	condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On
 64540	condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That
 64541	is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which
 64542	we do not understand.
 64543	
 64544	If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,
 64545	then having subjected to criticism the explanation of âpowerâ that
 64546	juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely
 64547	a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man
 64548	has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his
 64549	reflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but
 64550	an actually existing phenomenon.
 64551	
 64552	Not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity
 64553	of men can do without the conception of power, the existence of power is
 64554	proved both by history and by observing contemporary events.
 64555	
 64556	Whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose will the
 64557	event seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree and the
 64558	French go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and
 64559	an army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters
 64560	Russia. Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the
 64561	Bourbons. Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always
 64562	related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it.
 64563	
 64564	The historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine
 64565	intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in
 64566	the expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that
 64567	supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.
 64568	
 64569	On the one side reflection shows that the expression of a manâs willâhis
 64570	wordsâare only part of the general activity expressed in an event,
 64571	as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without assuming an
 64572	incomprehensible, supernatural forceâa miracleâone cannot admit that
 64573	words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men.
 64574	On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the cause
 64575	of events, history shows that the expression of the will of historical
 64576	personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that is to say,
 64577	their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very opposite
 64578	of what they order occurs.
 64579	
 64580	Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we
 64581	cannot regard âpowerâ as the cause of events.
 64582	
 64583	Power, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that
 64584	exists between the expression of someoneâs will and the execution of
 64585	that will by others.
 64586	
 64587	To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a
 64588	conception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the
 64589	Deity.
 64590	
 64591	If the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history
 64592	tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not
 64593	caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event. But
 64594	speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting
 64595	in time and in relation to one another, to explain the connection of
 64596	commands with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that
 64597	takes place: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and
 64598	of the person who commands, and (2) the inevitability of the connection
 64599	between the person commanding and those who execute his command.
 64600	
 64601	
 64602	
 64603	
 64604	
 64605	CHAPTER VI
 64606	
 64607	Only the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time, can
 64608	relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or
 64609	centuries, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can by His
 64610	sole will determine the direction of humanityâs movement; but man acts
 64611	in time and himself takes part in what occurs.
 64612	
 64613	Reinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no
 64614	command can be executed without some preceding order having been given
 64615	rendering the execution of the last command possible.
 64616	
 64617	No command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series
 64618	of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers
 64619	to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.
 64620	
 64621	When, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war,
 64622	we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive
 64623	commands dependent one on another. Napoleon could not have commanded
 64624	an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered such and such
 64625	papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg;
 64626	tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the
 64627	commissariat, and so on and so onâmillions of commands, which formed
 64628	a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the
 64629	French armies into Russia.
 64630	
 64631	If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion
 64632	of England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort,
 64633	and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that
 64634	design but undertook an expedition into Russia, with which country he
 64635	considered it desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly
 64636	expressed)âthis came about because his commands did not correspond to
 64637	the course of events in the first case, but did so correspond in the
 64638	latter.
 64639	
 64640	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should
 64641	order what can be executed. But to know what can and what cannot be
 64642	executed is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleonâs invasion of
 64643	Russia in which millions participated, but even in the simplest event,
 64644	for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its
 64645	execution. Every order executed is always one of an immense number
 64646	unexecuted. All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of
 64647	events remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get linked up with a
 64648	consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events, and
 64649	are executed.
 64650	
 64651	Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes
 64652	it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of
 64653	thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that
 64654	event have been executed, we forget about the others that were not
 64655	executed because they could not be. Apart from that, the chief source
 64656	of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical
 64657	accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such
 64658	for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia, is
 64659	generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that
 64660	series of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole
 64661	series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.
 64662	
 64663	We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In
 64664	reality in all Napoleonâs activity we never find anything resembling an
 64665	expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of
 64666	his will, very variously and indefinitely directed. Amid a long series
 64667	of unexecuted orders of Napoleonâs one series, for the campaign of 1812,
 64668	was carried outânot because those orders differed in any way from the
 64669	other, unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of
 64670	events that led the French army into Russia; just as in stencil work
 64671	this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from
 64672	this side or in that way, but because it was laid on from all sides over
 64673	the figure cut in the stencil.
 64674	
 64675	So that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events,
 64676	we find that a command can never be the cause of the event, but that a
 64677	certain definite dependence exists between the two.
 64678	
 64679	To understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to
 64680	reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from
 64681	the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the command
 64682	himself takes part in the event.
 64683	
 64684	This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is
 64685	called power. This relation consists in the following:
 64686	
 64687	For common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which
 64688	regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action, the
 64689	relation between those taking part in it is always the same.
 64690	
 64691	Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward
 64692	one another that the larger number take a more direct share, and the
 64693	smaller number a less direct share, in the collective action for which
 64694	they have combined.
 64695	
 64696	Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of
 64697	the most striking and definite examples is an army.
 64698	
 64699	Every army is composed of lower grades of the serviceâthe rank and
 64700	fileâof whom there are always the greatest number; of the next higher
 64701	military rankâcorporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are
 64702	fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer,
 64703	and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one
 64704	person.
 64705	
 64706	A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of
 64707	which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file;
 64708	the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next
 64709	higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which
 64710	will represent the commander in chief.
 64711	
 64712	The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of
 64713	the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking,
 64714	burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions
 64715	from men above him; he himself never gives an order. The noncommissioned
 64716	officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less
 64717	frequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An
 64718	officer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more
 64719	frequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the
 64720	objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief
 64721	never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general
 64722	orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar
 64723	relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men
 64724	for common activityâin agriculture, trade, and every administration.
 64725	
 64726	And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of
 64727	a cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in
 64728	any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the
 64729	highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action, combine
 64730	in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing
 64731	the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are,
 64732	while the less their direct participation in the action itself, the more
 64733	they command and the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from
 64734	the lowest ranks to the man at the top, who takes the least direct share
 64735	in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding.
 64736	
 64737	This relation of the men who command to those they command is what
 64738	constitutes the essence of the conception called power.
 64739	
 64740	Having restored the condition of time under which all events occur,
 64741	we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a
 64742	corresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition of
 64743	relation between those who command and those who execute, we find that
 64744	by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part
 64745	in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to
 64746	commanding.
 64747	
 64748	
 64749	
 64750	
 64751	
 64752	CHAPTER VII
 64753	
 64754	When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes
 64755	about it, and as the event results from the collective activity of
 64756	many people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be
 64757	fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions expressed
 64758	is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command
 64759	preceding it.
 64760	
 64761	Men are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to how and
 64762	where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens that this is
 64763	done as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have command and power
 64764	in their primary form. The man who worked most with his hands could not
 64765	think so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or command what
 64766	would result from the common activity; while the man who commanded
 64767	more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater
 64768	verbal activity.
 64769	
 64770	When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim
 64771	there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their activity is
 64772	given to directing and commanding, take less part in the direct work.
 64773	
 64774	When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which
 64775	as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his present
 64776	activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just the same is
 64777	done by a concourse of people, allowing those who do not take a direct
 64778	part in the activity to devise considerations, justifications, and
 64779	surmises concerning their collective activity.
 64780	
 64781	For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill
 64782	one another. And corresponding to the event its justification appears in
 64783	peopleâs belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for
 64784	liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one another, and
 64785	this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a
 64786	centralization of power, resistance to Europe, and so on. Men went
 64787	from the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event
 64788	was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of
 64789	England, and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the
 64790	events have no common sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of
 64791	killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing
 64792	of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these
 64793	justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day.
 64794	
 64795	These justifications release those who produce the events from moral
 64796	responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front
 64797	of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear
 64798	menâs moral responsibilities from their path.
 64799	
 64800	Without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest
 64801	question that presents itself when examining each historical event. How
 64802	is it that millions of men commit collective crimesâmake war, commit
 64803	murder, and so on?
 64804	
 64805	With the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe
 64806	can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by monarchs,
 64807	ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is there any
 64808	collective action which cannot find its justification in political
 64809	unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization? So
 64810	that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed
 64811	wish and, receiving a justification, presents itself as the result of
 64812	the will of one man or of several men.
 64813	
 64814	In whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts
 64815	will always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship the
 64816	movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.
 64817	
 64818	Only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and
 64819	comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that
 64820	every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship,
 64821	and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were
 64822	imperceptibly moving.
 64823	
 64824	We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical
 64825	characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that
 64826	occursâthe continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the
 64827	essential connection of historical persons with the masses.
 64828	
 64829	When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave
 64830	ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns
 64831	frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave
 64832	anticipating its movement.
 64833	
 64834	Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen
 64835	and decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither
 64836	directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance
 64837	seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the shipâs
 64838	movement also.
 64839	
 64840	Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons
 64841	which, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed
 64842	that the events depended on those commands. But examining the events
 64843	themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to
 64844	the people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on
 64845	events. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many
 64846	commands were issued, the event does not take place unless there are
 64847	other causes for it, but as soon as an event occursâbe it what it
 64848	mayâthen out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people
 64849	some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of
 64850	utterance are related as commands to the events.
 64851	
 64852	Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to
 64853	these two essential questions of history:
 64854	
 64855	(1) What is power?
 64856	
 64857	(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?
 64858	
 64859	(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals,
 64860	in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and
 64861	justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is
 64862	his participation in that action.
 64863	
 64864	(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual
 64865	activity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have
 64866	supposed, but by the activity of all the people who participate in
 64867	the events, and who always combine in such a way that those taking
 64868	the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least
 64869	responsibility and vice versa.
 64870	
 64871	Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically
 64872	it is those who submit to the power. But as the moral activity is
 64873	inconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event is neither in
 64874	the one nor in the other but in the union of the two.
 64875	
 64876	Or in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the
 64877	phenomena we are examining.
 64878	
 64879	In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinityâthat final limit
 64880	to which in every domain of thought manâs reason arrives if it is not
 64881	playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat produces
 64882	electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another.
 64883	
 64884	Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we
 64885	cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is
 64886	inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The
 64887	same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do
 64888	not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action,
 64889	people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and
 64890	we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other
 64891	words that it is a law.
 64892	
 64893	
 64894	
 64895	
 64896	
 64897	CHAPTER VIII
 64898	
 64899	If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this
 64900	simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our
 64901	argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter
 64902	cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion
 64903	and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history,
 64904	says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.
 64905	
 64906	The presence of the problem of manâs free will, though unexpressed, is
 64907	felt at every step of history.
 64908	
 64909	All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this
 64910	question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the
 64911	false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of
 64912	a solution of that question.
 64913	
 64914	If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he
 64915	pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.
 64916	
 64917	If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that
 64918	is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that manâs
 64919	in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the
 64920	possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity.
 64921	
 64922	If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot
 64923	exist, for then manâs will is subject to that law.
 64924	
 64925	In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most
 64926	ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient
 64927	times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.
 64928	
 64929	The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation
 64930	from whatever point of viewâtheological, historical, ethical, or
 64931	philosophicâwe find a general law of necessity to which he (like all
 64932	that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what
 64933	we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.
 64934	
 64935	This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and
 64936	independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only
 64937	through consciousness does he know himself.
 64938	
 64939	Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason
 64940	is conceivable.
 64941	
 64942	To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be
 64943	conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as
 64944	a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of
 64945	his volition. But his willâwhich forms the essence of his lifeâman
 64946	recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.
 64947	
 64948	If, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed by
 64949	one and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking
 64950	food, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this
 64951	never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of
 64952	it. Were it not free it could not be limited. A manâs will seems to him
 64953	to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free.
 64954	
 64955	You say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.
 64956	Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable
 64957	demonstration of freedom.
 64958	
 64959	That reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to
 64960	reason.
 64961	
 64962	If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent
 64963	source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and
 64964	to experience, but in fact such subjection does not exist and is
 64965	inconceivable.
 64966	
 64967	A series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he, as
 64968	an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man submits to
 64969	them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he
 64970	has become acquainted with them. But the same series of experiments
 64971	and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is
 64972	conscious in himself is impossible, and that his every action depends
 64973	on his organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet
 64974	man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments.
 64975	Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls
 64976	downwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law
 64977	that he has learned to be fulfilled.
 64978	
 64979	But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does
 64980	not and cannot believe this.
 64981	
 64982	However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
 64983	same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as
 64984	before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character
 64985	he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the
 64986	same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment
 64987	that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however
 64988	incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is
 64989	impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the
 64990	same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which
 64991	constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels
 64992	that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception
 64993	of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would
 64994	be unable to live for a single moment.
 64995	
 64996	He could not live, because all manâs efforts, all his impulses to life,
 64997	are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and
 64998	obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and
 64999	disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger,
 65000	virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.
 65001	
 65002	A man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of
 65003	life.
 65004	
 65005	If the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless
 65006	contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and
 65007	the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that only
 65008	proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.
 65009	
 65010	This unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled by
 65011	experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone
 65012	without exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man
 65013	is possible constitutes the other side of the question.
 65014	
 65015	Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God.
 65016	What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of
 65017	manâs freedom? That is a question for theology.
 65018	
 65019	The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in
 65020	statistics. What is manâs responsibility to society, the conception of
 65021	which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for
 65022	jurisprudence.
 65023	
 65024	Manâs actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting
 65025	upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong
 65026	in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a
 65027	question for ethics.
 65028	
 65029	Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject
 65030	to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that
 65031	connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and
 65032	of humanity be regardedâas the result of the free, or as the result of
 65033	the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for history.
 65034	
 65035	Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledgeâthanks
 65036	to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of printed
 65037	matterâhas the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on
 65038	which the question itself cannot exist. In our time the majority of
 65039	so-called advanced peopleâthat is, the crowd of ignoramusesâhave taken
 65040	the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a
 65041	solution of the whole problem.
 65042	
 65043	They say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist,
 65044	for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular
 65045	movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul and
 65046	free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang
 65047	from the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that thousands of
 65048	years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now
 65049	trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely
 65050	acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers, but has never
 65051	been denied. They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in
 65052	this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination
 65053	of one side of it. For the fact that, from the point of view of
 65054	observation, reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain, and
 65055	that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals
 65056	at some unknown period of time, only explains from a fresh side
 65057	the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and
 65058	philosophic theoriesâthat from the point of view of reason man is
 65059	subject to the law of necessity; but it does not advance by a hairâs
 65060	breadth the solution of the question, which has another, opposite, side,
 65061	based on the consciousness of freedom.
 65062	
 65063	If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is
 65064	as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a
 65065	certain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is the
 65066	time, in the second case it is the origin); and the question of how
 65067	manâs consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of
 65068	necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative
 65069	physiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can
 65070	observe only the muscular nervous activity, but in man we observe
 65071	consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity.
 65072	
 65073	The naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this
 65074	question, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of
 65075	a church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief
 65076	superintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over the
 65077	windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should be
 65078	delighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything is now
 65079	so smooth and regular.
 65080	
 65081	
 65082	
 65083	
 65084	
 65085	CHAPTER IX
 65086	
 65087	For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history
 65088	has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the
 65089	question is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer
 65090	to the essence of manâs free will but its manifestation in the past and
 65091	under certain conditions.
 65092	
 65093	In regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as
 65094	experimental science stands to abstract science.
 65095	
 65096	The subject for history is not manâs will itself but our presentation of
 65097	it.
 65098	
 65099	And so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the
 65100	incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does
 65101	for theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a presentation of
 65102	manâs life in which the union of these two contradictions has already
 65103	taken place.
 65104	
 65105	In actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly
 65106	and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although
 65107	each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.
 65108	
 65109	To solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and
 65110	what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the philosophy
 65111	of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other
 65112	sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and
 65113	inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life
 65114	under those definitions, history should deduce a definition of the
 65115	conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense
 65116	quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear
 65117	dependent on these two elements.
 65118	
 65119	Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual
 65120	we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of manâs free
 65121	will and partly of the law of inevitability.
 65122	
 65123	Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions
 65124	of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someoneâs
 65125	action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his
 65126	walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and
 65127	inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined
 65128	for us.
 65129	
 65130	Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to
 65131	differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but
 65132	every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and
 65133	inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of
 65134	freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more
 65135	freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive, and
 65136	the more inevitability the less freedom.
 65137	
 65138	The proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases
 65139	according to the point of view from which the action is regarded, but
 65140	their relation is always one of inverse proportion.
 65141	
 65142	A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother
 65143	exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained
 65144	to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless
 65145	manâseem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of
 65146	necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were
 65147	placed, and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself
 65148	drowning, that the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks,
 65149	and so on. Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and
 65150	has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty
 65151	and his action more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who
 65152	considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who
 65153	examined it the day after it was committed. And in the same way every
 65154	action of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less
 65155	free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him
 65156	who committed the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one
 65157	who does not know it. In all these cases the conception of freedom
 65158	is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is
 65159	correspondingly decreased or increased, according to the point of view
 65160	from which the action is regarded. So that the greater the conception of
 65161	necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.
 65162	
 65163	Religion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence,
 65164	and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and
 65165	freedom.
 65166	
 65167	All cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and
 65168	necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:
 65169	
 65170	(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds.
 65171	
 65172	(2) His relation to time.
 65173	
 65174	(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.
 65175	
 65176	The first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the manâs
 65177	relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness
 65178	of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man
 65179	in relation to everything coexisting with him. This is what makes it
 65180	evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity
 65181	than one standing on dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man
 65182	closely connected with others in a thickly populated district, or of one
 65183	bound by family, official, or business duties, seem certainly less free
 65184	and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and
 65185	seclusion.
 65186	
 65187	If we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around
 65188	him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation
 65189	to anything around him, if we see his connection with anything
 65190	whateverâwith a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on
 65191	which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that
 65192	falls on the things about himâwe see that each of these circumstances
 65193	has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity.
 65194	And the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of
 65195	his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that
 65196	weighs on him increases.
 65197	
 65198	The second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of
 65199	the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place
 65200	the manâs action occupies in time. That is the ground which makes the
 65201	fall of the first man, resulting in the production of the human race,
 65202	appear evidently less free than a manâs entry into marriage today. It is
 65203	the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago
 65204	and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life
 65205	of a contemporary, the consequences of which are still unknown to me.
 65206	
 65207	The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this
 65208	respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance
 65209	of the action and our judgment of it.
 65210	
 65211	If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same
 65212	circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly
 65213	free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in
 65214	different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had
 65215	not been committed much that resulted from itâgood, agreeable, and even
 65216	essentialâwould not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still
 65217	more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action
 65218	are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have
 65219	happened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back
 65220	in memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my
 65221	judgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my
 65222	action.
 65223	
 65224	In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning
 65225	the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A
 65226	contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the
 65227	known participants, but with a more remote event we already see its
 65228	inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible.
 65229	And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do
 65230	they appear.
 65231	
 65232	The Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the
 65233	crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem
 65234	to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroesâ
 65235	will. But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite
 65236	place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history
 65237	of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared
 65238	as merely due to the will of certain people. In regard to the migration
 65239	of the peoples it does not enter anyoneâs head today to suppose that
 65240	the renovation of the European world depended on Attilaâs caprice. The
 65241	farther back in history the object of our observation lies, the more
 65242	doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and
 65243	the more manifest the law of inevitability.
 65244	
 65245	The third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that
 65246	endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which each
 65247	phenomenon comprehended, and therefore manâs every action, must have
 65248	its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of
 65249	what will follow.
 65250	
 65251	The better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, and
 65252	historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled,
 65253	and the more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological,
 65254	and historical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are
 65255	observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in
 65256	question, the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our
 65257	actions and those of others appear.
 65258	
 65259	When we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a
 65260	crime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a
 65261	greater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we most urgently
 65262	demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we
 65263	rate its merit most highly. In an indifferent case we recognize in it
 65264	more individuality, originality, and independence. But if even one of
 65265	the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain
 65266	element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime,
 65267	or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom
 65268	of the apparently original action. That a criminal was reared among
 65269	malefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father
 65270	or mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more
 65271	comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less
 65272	deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The founder of a
 65273	sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when we know how or by
 65274	what the way was prepared for his activity. If we have a large range
 65275	of examples, if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the
 65276	correlation of cause and effect in peopleâs actions, their actions
 65277	appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we
 65278	connect the effects with the causes. If we examined simple actions and
 65279	had a vast number of such actions under observation, our conception of
 65280	their inevitability would be still greater. The dishonest conduct of the
 65281	son of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen
 65282	into bad company, a drunkardâs relapse into drunkenness, and so on are
 65283	actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause.
 65284	If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of
 65285	mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpletonâthen,
 65286	knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and
 65287	intelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so
 65288	little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action
 65289	we can foretell the result.
 65290	
 65291	On these three considerations alone is based the conception of
 65292	irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted
 65293	by all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less
 65294	according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in
 65295	which the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according
 65296	to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the
 65297	action and its investigation, and according to the greater or lesser
 65298	understanding of the causes that led to the action.
 65299	
 65300	
 65301	
 65302	
 65303	
 65304	CHAPTER X
 65305	
 65306	Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes
 65307	or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the
 65308	external world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, and the
 65309	greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we
 65310	contemplate a manâs life.
 65311	
 65312	So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the
 65313	external world is well known, where the time between the action and
 65314	its examination is great, and where the causes of the action are most
 65315	accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a
 65316	minimum of free will. If we examine a man little dependent on external
 65317	conditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the causes of
 65318	whose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of a minimum of
 65319	inevitability and a maximum of freedom.
 65320	
 65321	In neither caseâhowever we may change our point of view, however plain
 65322	we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external
 65323	world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short the
 65324	period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes
 65325	of the action may beâcan we ever conceive either complete freedom or
 65326	complete necessity.
 65327	
 65328	(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the
 65329	influence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom
 65330	in space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds
 65331	him and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My action seems
 65332	to me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every
 65333	direction, I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was
 65334	least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from
 65335	the construction of my own body. I chose one out of all the possible
 65336	directions because in it there were fewest obstacles. For my action
 65337	to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles. To
 65338	conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space, which is
 65339	evidently impossible.
 65340	
 65341	(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the
 65342	deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I examine
 65343	an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not
 65344	being free, for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was
 65345	committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself: could I have
 65346	abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed? To
 65347	convince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment. But I am
 65348	not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when I asked the
 65349	question. Time has gone by which I could not detain, the arm I then
 65350	lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting,
 65351	nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me. The
 65352	moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, and at that
 65353	moment I could make only one movement, and whatever movement I made
 65354	would be the only one. That I did not lift my arm a moment later does
 65355	not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then. And since I
 65356	could make only one movement at that single moment of time, it could not
 65357	have been any other. To imagine it as free, it is necessary to imagine
 65358	it in the present, on the boundary between the past and the futureâthat
 65359	is, outside time, which is impossible.
 65360	
 65361	(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be
 65362	increased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is,
 65363	an absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the
 65364	expression of will in any action, our own or anotherâs, the first demand
 65365	of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a
 65366	cause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action
 65367	independently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a
 65368	cause is the cause of my action.
 65369	
 65370	But even ifâimagining a man quite exempt from all influences, examining
 65371	only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any causeâwe were
 65372	to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled
 65373	zero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete
 65374	freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world, standing
 65375	outside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.
 65376	
 65377	In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of
 65378	freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.
 65379	
 65380	(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space
 65381	in which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for the
 65382	number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And
 65383	therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined,
 65384	there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom
 65385	remains.
 65386	
 65387	(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are
 65388	examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while
 65389	time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute
 65390	inevitability.
 65391	
 65392	(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we
 65393	shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we
 65394	never reach absolute inevitability.
 65395	
 65396	But besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to
 65397	equal zero, we assumed in some given caseâas for instance in that of a
 65398	dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiotâcomplete absence of freedom, by
 65399	so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are
 65400	examining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And
 65401	so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of
 65402	inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as
 65403	the conception of a manâs completely free action.
 65404	
 65405	And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of
 65406	inevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of an
 65407	infinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of time,
 65408	and an infinite series of causes.
 65409	
 65410	To imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of
 65411	inevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond time,
 65412	and free from dependence on cause.
 65413	
 65414	In the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom
 65415	we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of
 65416	inevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.
 65417	
 65418	In the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability we
 65419	should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and
 65420	cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would
 65421	be nothing, or mere content without form.
 65422	
 65423	We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which manâs
 65424	whole outlook on the universe is constructedâthe incomprehensible
 65425	essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.
 65426	
 65427	Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it
 65428	visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is
 65429	infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise.
 65430	(3) The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can
 65431	have no end.
 65432	
 65433	Consciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me,
 65434	consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed
 65435	moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living,
 65436	consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I feel myself
 65437	to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.
 65438	
 65439	Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability. Consciousness
 65440	gives expression to the essence of freedom.
 65441	
 65442	Freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in manâs
 65443	consciousness. Inevitability without content is manâs reason in its
 65444	three forms.
 65445	
 65446	Freedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines. Freedom
 65447	is the content. Inevitability is the form.
 65448	
 65449	Only by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one another
 65450	as form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and separately
 65451	incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.
 65452	
 65453	Only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of manâs life.
 65454	
 65455	Apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one
 65456	another as form and content, no conception of life is possible.
 65457	
 65458	All that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free
 65459	will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason.
 65460	
 65461	All that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
 65462	relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of
 65463	life to the laws of reason.
 65464	
 65465	The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of
 65466	them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal
 65467	force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and
 65468	we call that freedom.
 65469	
 65470	But just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but
 65471	felt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we
 65472	know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first
 65473	knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newtonâs law), so too the
 65474	force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is
 65475	conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of
 65476	inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies,
 65477	up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws).
 65478	
 65479	All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the
 65480	laws of reason.
 65481	
 65482	Manâs free will differs from every other force in that man is directly
 65483	conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from
 65484	any other force. The forces of gravitation, electricity, or chemical
 65485	affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are
 65486	differently defined by reason. Just so the force of manâs free will
 65487	is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the
 65488	definition reason gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, that is,
 65489	apart from the laws of reason that define it, differs in no way from
 65490	gravitation, or heat, or the force that makes things grow; for reason,
 65491	it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life.
 65492	
 65493	And as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies,
 65494	the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or
 65495	of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of
 65496	astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the
 65497	same way does the force of free will form the content of history.
 65498	But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this
 65499	unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the
 65500	subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free will
 65501	in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause forms
 65502	the subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of
 65503	metaphysics.
 65504	
 65505	In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of
 65506	inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is
 65507	only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know
 65508	of the essence of life.
 65509	
 65510	So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability,
 65511	what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an
 65512	expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of
 65513	human life.
 65514	
 65515	
 65516	
 65517	
 65518	
 65519	CHAPTER XI
 65520	
 65521	History examines the manifestations of manâs free will in connection
 65522	with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it
 65523	defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science
 65524	only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws.
 65525	
 65526	The recognition of manâs free will as something capable of influencing
 65527	historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for
 65528	history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies
 65529	would be for astronomy.
 65530	
 65531	That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws,
 65532	that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body
 65533	moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no
 65534	conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If
 65535	any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law
 65536	can exist, nor any conception of historical events.
 65537	
 65538	For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end
 65539	of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
 65540	consciousness of manâs will in the present moves in space, time, and
 65541	dependence on cause.
 65542	
 65543	The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more
 65544	evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define those laws
 65545	is the problem of history.
 65546	
 65547	From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its
 65548	subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in
 65549	manâs free will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible,
 65550	for however manâs free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize
 65551	it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes
 65552	impossible.
 65553	
 65554	Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that
 65555	is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince
 65556	ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then
 65557	instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as
 65558	its problem.
 65559	
 65560	The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of
 65561	thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously
 65562	with the self-destruction toward whichâever dissecting and dissecting
 65563	the causes of phenomenaâthe old method of history is moving.
 65564	
 65565	All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at
 65566	infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the
 65567	process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration
 65568	of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception
 65569	of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all
 65570	unknown, infinitely small, elements.
 65571	
 65572	In another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences
 65573	have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say
 65574	that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all
 65575	bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting
 65576	one another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the
 65577	movement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies
 65578	from the infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by
 65579	the natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they seek for
 65580	laws. History stands on the same path. And if history has for its object
 65581	the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the
 65582	narration of episodes in the lives of individuals, it too, setting
 65583	aside the conception of cause, should seek the laws common to all the
 65584	inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.
 65585	
 65586	
 65587	
 65588	
 65589	
 65590	CHAPTER XII
 65591	
 65592	From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the mere
 65593	recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves
 65594	sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients. By disproving
 65595	that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of
 65596	the movements of the bodies, but without disproving it, it would seem
 65597	impossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after
 65598	the discovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still
 65599	studied for a long time.
 65600	
 65601	From the time the first person said and proved that the number of births
 65602	or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that
 65603	mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic
 65604	conditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce
 65605	migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built
 65606	were destroyed in their essence.
 65607	
 65608	By refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been
 65609	retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue
 65610	studying historic events as the results of manâs free will. For if a
 65611	certain mode of government was established or certain migrations
 65612	of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic,
 65613	ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those
 65614	individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government
 65615	or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.
 65616	
 65617	And yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the
 65618	laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology,
 65619	and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.
 65620	
 65621	The struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly
 65622	fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard for the
 65623	old views and accused the new of violating revelation. But when truth
 65624	conquered, theology established itself just as firmly on the new
 65625	foundation.
 65626	
 65627	Just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between
 65628	the old and the new conception of history, and theology in the same way
 65629	stands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of subverting
 65630	revelation.
 65631	
 65632	In the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes
 65633	passion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret for
 65634	the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the other
 65635	is the passion for destruction.
 65636	
 65637	To the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy,
 65638	it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in
 65639	God, in the creation of the firmament, and in the miracle of Joshua the
 65640	son of Nun. To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to
 65641	Voltaire for example, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed
 65642	religion, and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against
 65643	religion.
 65644	
 65645	Just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of
 65646	inevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil,
 65647	and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on
 65648	those conceptions.
 65649	
 65650	So too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of
 65651	inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though
 65652	the law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in
 65653	astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation on which
 65654	the institutions of state and church are erected.
 65655	
 65656	As in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of history
 65657	now, the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or
 65658	nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure of visible
 65659	phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth, in history
 65660	it is the independence of personalityâfree will.
 65661	
 65662	As with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth
 65663	lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earthâs fixity and of
 65664	the motion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing
 65665	the subjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause
 65666	lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of oneâs own
 65667	personality. But as in astronomy the new view said: âIt is true that we
 65668	do not feel the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility
 65669	we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not
 65670	feel) we arrive at laws,â so also in history the new view says: âIt is
 65671	true that we are not conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our
 65672	free will we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on
 65673	the external world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws.â
 65674	
 65675	In the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an
 65676	unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel;
 65677	in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom
 65678	that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not
 65679	conscious.

 65693	
 65694	Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

 65728	electronic works
 65729	
 65730	1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenbergâ¢
 65731	electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 65732	and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 65733	(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
 65734	the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
 65735	destroy all copies of Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works in your
 65736	possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
 65737	Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
 65738	by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
 65739	or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
 65740	
 65741	1.B. âProject Gutenbergâ is a registered trademark. It may only be
 65742	used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 65743	agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
 65744	things that you can do with most Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works
 65745	even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
 65746	paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 65747	Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
 65748	agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenbergâ¢
 65749	electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
 65750	
 65751	1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (âthe
 65752	Foundationâ or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
 65753	of Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
 65754	works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
 65755	States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
 65756	United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
 65757	claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
 65758	displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
 65759	all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
 65760	that you will support the Project Gutenbergâ¢ mission of promoting
 65761	free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenbergâ¢
 65762	works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
 65763	Project Gutenbergâ¢ name associated with the work. You can easily
 65764	comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
 65765	same format with its attached full Project Gutenbergâ¢ License when
 65766	you share it without charge with others.
 65767	
 65768	1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 65769	what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
 65770	in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
 65771	check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
 65772	agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
 65773	distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
 65774	other Project Gutenbergâ¢ work. The Foundation makes no
 65775	representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
 65776	country other than the United States.

 65784	phrase âProject Gutenbergâ is associated) is accessed, displayed,
 65785	performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

 65794	  
 65795	1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic work is
 65796	derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
 65797	contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
 65798	copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
 65799	the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

 65804	trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
 65805	
 65806	1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic work is posted
 65807	with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 65808	must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
 65809	additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
 65810	will be linked to the Project Gutenbergâ¢ License for all works
 65811	posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
 65812	beginning of this work.
 65813	
 65814	1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenbergâ¢

 65824	1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 65825	compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
 65826	any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
 65827	to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenbergâ¢ work in a format
 65828	other than âPlain Vanilla ASCIIâ or other format used in the official
 65829	version posted on the official Project Gutenbergâ¢ website
 65830	(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
 65831	to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
 65832	of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original âPlain
 65833	Vanilla ASCIIâ or other form. Any alternate format must include the
 65834	full Project Gutenbergâ¢ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
 65835	
 65836	1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 65837	performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenbergâ¢ works
 65838	unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
 65839	
 65840	1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 65841	access to or distributing Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works
 65842	provided that:
 65843	
 65844	    â¢ You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
 65845	        the use of Project Gutenbergâ¢ works calculated using the method
 65846	        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
 65847	        to the owner of the Project Gutenbergâ¢ trademark, but he has
 65848	        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
 65849	        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
 65850	        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
 65851	        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
 65852	        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
 65853	        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
 65854	        Section 4, âInformation about donations to the Project Gutenberg
 65855	        Literary Archive Foundation.â
 65856	    
 65857	    â¢ You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
 65858	        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
 65859	        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenbergâ¢
 65860	        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
 65861	        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
 65862	        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenbergâ¢
 65863	        works.
 65864	    
 65865	    â¢ You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
 65866	        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
 65867	        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
 65868	        receipt of the work.
 65869	    
 65870	    â¢ You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
 65871	        distribution of Project Gutenbergâ¢ works.
 65872	    
 65873	
 65874	1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
 65875	Gutenbergâ¢ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
 65876	are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
 65877	from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
 65878	the Project Gutenbergâ¢ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
 65879	forth in Section 3 below.
 65880	
 65881	1.F.
 65882	
 65883	1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 65884	effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 65885	works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
 65886	Gutenbergâ¢ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenbergâ¢
 65887	electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
 65888	contain âDefects,â such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
 65889	or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
 65890	intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
 65891	other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
 65892	cannot be read by your equipment.
 65893	
 65894	1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the âRight
 65895	of Replacement or Refundâ described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

 65898	Gutenbergâ¢ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 65899	liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 65900	fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 65901	LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 65902	PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 65903	TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 65904	LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 65905	INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 65906	DAMAGE.
 65907	
 65908	1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 65909	defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 65910	receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 65911	written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
 65912	received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
 65913	with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
 65914	with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
 65915	lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
 65916	or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
 65917	opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
 65918	the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
 65919	without further opportunities to fix the problem.
 65920	
 65921	1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 65922	in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you âAS-ISâ, WITH NO
 65923	OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
 65924	LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
 65925	
 65926	1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 65927	warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
 65928	damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
 65929	violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
 65930	agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
 65931	limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
 65932	unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
 65933	remaining provisions.
 65934	
 65935	1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 65936	trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 65937	providing copies of Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works in
 65938	accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
 65939	production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenbergâ¢
 65940	electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
 65941	including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
 65942	the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
 65943	or any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
 65944	additions or deletions to any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, and (c) any
 65945	Defect you cause.
 65946	
 65947	Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢
 65948	
 65949	Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of
 65950	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
 65951	computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
 65952	exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
 65953	from people in all walks of life.
 65954	
 65955	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 65956	assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs
 65957	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will
 65958	remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
 65959	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 65960	and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future
 65961	generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
 65962	Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
 65963	Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
 65964	
 65965	Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 65966	
 65967	The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
 65968	501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
 65969	state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
 65970	Revenue Service. The Foundationâs EIN or federal tax identification
 65971	number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 65972	Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
 65973	U.S. federal laws and your stateâs laws.
 65974	
 65975	The Foundationâs business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
 65976	Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

 65979	
 65980	Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 65981	Literary Archive Foundation
 65982	
 65983	Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
 65984	public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 65985	increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 65986	freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
 65987	array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
 65988	($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 65989	status with the IRS.
 65990	
 65991	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 65992	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 65993	States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 65994	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 65995	with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
 65996	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
 65997	DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
 65998	visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
 65999	
 66000	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 66001	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 66002	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 66003	approach us with offers to donate.
 66004	
 66005	International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 66006	any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 66007	outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 66009	Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
 66010	methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
 66011	ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

 66014	Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works
 66015	
 66016	Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
 66017	Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
 66018	freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
 66019	distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of
 66020	volunteer support.
 66021	
 66022	Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
 66023	editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
 66024	the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
 66025	necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
 66026	edition.
 66027	
 66028	Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
 66029	facility: www.gutenberg.org.
 66030	
 66031	This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,
 66032	including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 66033	Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 66034	subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
